","this is a water recycling project that will provide the distribution system required to make available filtered and disinfected effluent from cccsd's water reclamation facility for landscape irrigation in concord. it is an extension of the cccsd existing zone 1 project. this project provides water quality improvements to the suisun bay because effluent diverted to irrigation reduces cccsd discharge volume which reduces pollutant loading into suisun bay. this project reduces freshwater diversions from the sacramento delta thereby improving water quality. the project area is located within a disadvantaged community. ","the central contra costa sanitary district (cccsd) concord recycled water project will expand its recycled water distribution system to provide recycled water to irrigation users in the city of concord (east of the i-680 freeway and south of buchanan fields airport). the project consists of constructing approximately 2.5 miles of 4 to 10 pvc and hdpe pipeline and connecting up to 34 landscape irrigation connections. approximately 190 afy of recycled water will be used for landscape irrigation at businesses and roadway medians. this project also includes retrofit of backflow preventers required to connect users. the existing recycled water treatment storage and pumping facilities that currently serve the zone 1 recycled water project will also serve the new concord recycled water project. 10\" hdpe 1700 feet 10\" pvc 1400 feet 8\" pvc 1900 feet 6\" pvc 1400 feet 4\" pvc 6100 feet total 12500 feet approximately 2.5 miles service laterals 34 on-site connections 34 ","irrigation demands are seasonal with peak demand in summer time. water shortages typically occur during the summer months. therefore irrigating with recycled water reduces regional water demand during times where water shortages are most likely to occur. this improves regional water supply reliability. water recycling is a component of contra costa water districts (ccwd) long-term sustainable water supply strategy. in times of water shortages ccwd may impose water rationing. this project reduces the water demand and mitigates water shortages during drought year. ccwd water supply is from sacramento-san joaquin delta. using recycled water for landscape irrigation reduces demands on the delta. ","in times of water shortages in the contra costa water districts service area water rationing can be employed. the use of recycled water for landscape irrigation reduces the demand on the ccwd potable system lessening the need to ration. customers using recycled water will not be affected by water rationing that contra costa water district puts in place during water storages. ","the primary benefit of this project is that it will offset 190 afy of the potable water originating from the delta currently used for landscape irrigation. it reduces freshwater diversions from the sacramento delta and improves regional water supply reliability. water reuse also reduces cccsd discharge volume which reduces pollutant loading into suisun bay. recycled water contains ammonia which fertilizes turf. customers reduce/eliminate fertilizer application thus reducing emissions related to fertilizer production.

"corte madera creek watershed: saunders fish barrier removal ","ross taylor & associates assessed and prioritized barriers to fish passage in the corte madera creek watershed in 2006. a culvert containing an alaskan steeppass fish ladder at the saunders avenue rrossing of san anselmo creek a tributary to corte madera creek is the highest priority for treatment. an active 24-inch sewer rests on the bed of the creek immediately upstream of the box culvert. each of these features individually would cause san anselmo creek to overtop the bank of the creek by about 6 inches during the 100-year event. to address both the flooding and fish passage problems requires a new bridge and rerouting the sewer so it can be buried in the stream bed. ","marin ","37.98140742932986 | -122.57099211215973 ","when funding is obtained "," ","san anselmo creek at sanders avenue san anselmo california ","water quality: when flooding occurs water quality is harmed by the materials carried into the creek by the out-of-bank flows: excessive sediment gardening supplies and chemicals automotive care products and other materials typically found in garages and garden sheds. habitat protection and restoration: the project would remove a barrier to passage for steelhead trout and other fishes in san anselmo creek. invasive non-natives would be removed from the bank within the project area on the high school campus and native plants would be installed. flood protection: replacing the bridge and relocating the sewer would remove up to 19 homes plus a portion of the sir francis drake high school campus from the 100-year flood plain of san anselmo creek. ","a full-span bridge will be constructed a 24-inch sewer and the lateral connecting drake high school to the sewer will be relocated and a roughened channel will be installed under the new bridge. the roughened channel is necessary to avoid undercutting retaining walls that have been built by homeowners all along the right bank in the project area and on the left bank downstream of the bridge. the new configuration of the sewer and the bridge will provide capacity for the 100-year flow in san anselmo creek and meet noaa fisheries and california department of fish and game criteria for passage of all age classes of steelhead trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) that are known to occupy the watershed. ","fish passage: in the 1980s an alaskan steeppass fish ladder was installed and a low-flow channel constructed to provide upstream passage for adult anadromous steelhead. however the steeppass and low-flow channel are poorly suited for providing adult steelhead passage at typical migration flows. at migration flows the hydraulic capacity of the steeppass is overwhelmed and there is inadequate attraction flow for fish to find the outlet. at lower flows there is inadequate depth in the low-flow channel for adult steelhead to swim through. the fish passage facility also lacks a pool at the transition from the low-flow channel into the steeppass making entry difficult. additionally an alaskan steeppass does not provide passage for juvenile salmonids and is highly susceptible to plugging by debris. replacing the fish ladder and associated concrete structures with a roughened channel will provide passage for all age classes of steelhead and coho salmon (corte madera creek is critical habitat for both species although coho salmon were extirpated from the watershed by the mid-1980s). flooding: an active 24-inch sewer that forms a low dam on the bed of the creek causes water to leave the creek channel during the 100-year event; when that happens the bridge is adequate to convey the flow that remains in the channel. hydraulic modeling shows that if the sewer were removed from the bed of the creek then the bridge itself would cause flooding. when the water leaves the channel it floods a portion of the campus of sir francis drake high school 139 saunders avenue and 18 properties on agatha court. to avoid flooding during the 100-year event the sewer must be relocated and the bridge replaced. ","flood risk will be unabated in the vicinity of the saunders avenue bridge leaving many properties in the 100-year flood plain. migrating steelhead will be unable to pass the barrier at saunders avenue substantially all the time. ","none the degradation of water quality caused by flooding will e reduced. this includes excessive erosion of upland areas that flood addition of household and garden chemicals to the creek when garages homes and garden sheds flood and sewage overflows that typically occur when flooding occurs and overwhelms sewers. the 100-year flow will be retained in the channel if the project is implemented. this would remove 20 properties from the 100-year flood plain. the project would remove a barrier to passage for steelhead trout and other fishes in san anselmo creek. invasive non-natives would be removed from the bank within the project area on the high school campus and native plants would be installed.

"lower lagunitas creek habitat restoration project ","this project will implement restoration work along 4 miles of lagunitas creek to benefit endangered coho salmon and threatened steelhead trout. the work will enhance overwinter and floodplain habitat in the mainstem of the creek and reduce sediment loading and improve fish passage by storm-proofing tributary stream crossings along the cross marin trail in the same reach. this project expands two existing irwmp projects: lagunitas creek winter habitat enhancement implementation and lagunitas creek sediment reduction and management project. ","marin ","38.0503 | -122.7602 ","01/01/2015 ","09/30/2019 ","lagunitas creek marin county. the project area is a 4.1-mile reach of the mainstem of the creek and the associated tributaries located downstream of kent lake (see attached project location map.) ","drinking water supply: this project addresses water supply reliability by reducing potential vulnerabilities associated with a major water supply distribution pipeline. water quality improvement: this project will reduce sediment input to creeks and enhance floodplain sediment storage addressing goals and objectives identified in the state's lagunitas creek sediment tmdl. stormwater improvement: the project will implement road drainage improvements by sizing them for the 100 year storm thereby reducing turbidity and other adverse impacts from stormwater flows from these roads. habitat protection and restoration: the project will enhance overwinter habitat for coho salmon and steelhead trout in the mainstem and adjacent floodplain of lagunitas creek. the project will improve habitat for endangered salmonid species by reducing fine sediment loading to fish bearing streams and in some cases removing barriers to fish passage. ","lagunitas creek supports the largest and most stable population of endangered coho salmon in central california as well as a robust population of threatened steelhead trout. this project will restore habitat for these species by enhancing overwinter habitat and reducing fine sediment input to the creek. these are two critical implementation strategies identified to support and encourage recovery of coho and steelhead. the restoration work is identified for implementation in the lagunitas creek stewardship plan (2011 mmwd) the state and federal coho salmon recovery plans and the states sediment tmdl plan for lagunitas creek. this project expands two previously submitted irwmp projects: lagunitas creek winter habitat enhancement implementation and lagunitas creek sediment reduction and management project. the project is detailed in two recently completed studies. winter habitat enhancement construction sites were identified in the lagunitas creek salmonid winter habitat enhancement assessment report (2013) and then the basis of design report for the lagunitas creek salmonid winter habitat enhancement project (2013) provided 100% construction designs and specifications for winter habitat enhancement work at nine specific sites. sediment reduction work was identified in the lagunitas creek watershed sediment source site assessment (2013) which specifies treatment recommendations and sediment savings for each identified road erosion site including 60 sites along the cross marin trail. an initial phase of the winter habitat enhancement work (at four sites) has been awarded 2014 california department of fish and wildlife fisheries restoration grant program funding. an initial phase of the sediment reduction work (at three major sites) is currently being implemented funded under the bay areas proposition 84 round 2 implementation grant. the project proposed here is a second phase of winter habitat enhancement and sediment reduction work to be conducted in proximity to the phase one efforts in and at tributaries to lagunitas creek. winter habitat enhancement survival of coho and steelhead in the creek can be improved by enhancing rearing and high flow refuge areas. this implementation project will install large woody debris structures as engineered log jams to reconnect the floodplain with the main channel to be used by over wintering juveniles and spawning adults. this will allow for higher densities and greater carrying capacity of salmonids through the winter. reconnecting the floodplain will also allow for fine sediments in the flood waters to settle out and be stored in the floodplain to improve water quality. this project will implement the construction of up to four winter habitat enhancement features which were previously identified and designed in the winter habitat assessment. the assessment produced 100% engineered design drawings specifications and construction cost estimates for the specific sites where habitat enhancement will be implemented. the 100% design drawings will be used for environmental review and permitting contractor bidding and site construction. sediment reduction sedimentation particularly by fine sediments has been identified as being detrimental to the habitat of lagunitas creek for coho and steelhead. the state water quality control board has identified lagunitas creek as being impaired by sediment and has adopted a sediment tmdl for lagunitas creek. this project will implement actions aimed at reducing fine sediments from entering the creek leading to enhanced water quality and streambed conditions of lagunitas creek. in addition project work will strengthen the route along which the marin municipal water districts nicasio transmission pipeline a major public water supply transmission line runs. project work will be conducted collaboratively on mmwd state park and national park service (nps) lands as well as some private properties within the watershed in collaboration with the marin rcd. the above referenced lagunitas creek watershed sediment source site assessment has identified approximately 300 sediment source sites on unpaved roads in the watershed downstream of reservoirs. this includes 60 sites along the cross-marin trail which is the route of mmwds nicasio transmission pipeline and an important recreational trail. this irwmp project will implement improvements to the cross marin trail to strengthen the transmission line and stabilize this recreational trail. the work will address both chronic and catastrophic sources of sediment. also gravel management actions as identified from an mmwd-led in stream gravel assessment will be implemented in order to increase the gravel and cobble fraction of the streambed. this project work is included in the lagunitas creek stewardship plan. also winter habitat enhancement and sediment reduction in lagunitas creek have been identified as important recovery actions in the state's recovery strategy for california coho salmon as well as the federal recovery plan for central california coastal coho salmon. in addition fine sediment reduction is a focus of the state's lagunitas creek sediment tmdl. project scalability the scope of this project and the grant request amount are scalable. total estimated costs to implement the winter habitat enhancement and sediment reduction work identified for this reach of lagunitas creek is $5 million. initial phases of work already funded will accomplish $1.5 million in work leaving $3.5 million unfunded. this proposal requests $1.5 million and will accomplish $2 million in work. by adding or reducing the number of project sites implemented the proposed grant request and cost share can be scaled upwards to $3.5 million or downwards to $1.0 million. disadvantaged community: this project does not provide benefits specifically for a dac; the project will benefit the lagunitas creek watershed in marin county california and the bay area region in general. dac this project will not provide specific benefits directly for a disadvantaged community. the project will benefit the region and lagunitas creek in general rather than a specific dac. ","regional priorities addressed by this project include regional water supply reliability/long-term sustainability; health of the bay and creeks; sediment management; and fisheries restoration for coho salmon and steelhead recovery. lagunitas creek supports the largest and most stable population of endangered coho salmon in central california; it also supports a robust population of threatened steelhead trout. the lagunitas limiting factors analysis (stillwater sciences 2008) identified winter habitat as the limiting factor for both coho salmon and steelhead populations in the lagunitas creek watershed. fall juvenile and spring smolt survey data indicate dramatic declines in the numbers of juvenile coho during the winter months. it is hypothesized that winter habitat in lagunitas creek is limited during base flow to bank-full periods. sedimentation particularly by fine sediments has been identified as being detrimental to the habitat of lagunitas creek for coho and steelhead. roads are a major source of both chronic and catastrophic sediment loading to fish-bearing streams. mmwd has major water supply transmission pipelines running under some of the roads in the lagunitas watershed. the sediment site source assessments estimates that up to 56400 cu.yds of sediment (over 20000 cu.yds. on the cross marin trail alone) could be prevented from entering lagunitas creek and its tributaries by implementing the recommended sediment reduction work. the state water resources control board has identified lagunitas creek as being impaired by sediment and has adopted the lagunitas creek sediment tmdl which calls for implementing sediment reduction from roads and also to reconnect the mainstem of lagunitas creek to its floodplain and install large wood to sort and store fine sediment. this project will implement actions aimed at increasing winter habitat and reducing fine sediments from entering the creek leading to enhanced habitat water quality and streambed conditions of lagunitas creek. in addition some of the project work will secure the route along the marin municipal water districts (mmwds) nicasio transmission pipeline a major public water supply transmission line. the federal recovery plan for evolutionarily significant unit of central california coast coho salmon final plan (national marine fisheries service  2012) includes this task for coho recovery: conduct rehabilitation activities that restore channels floodplains and meadows to extend the duration of the summer flow and provide refuge from high winter flows (evaluate the tocaloma reach of the lower lagunitas mainstem). this project is within the tocaloma reach of lower lagunitas creek. ","coho salmon in central california are on the brink of extinction; not implementing this project will not provide the habitat enhancement and sediment reduction needed to help recover the population not only for lagunitas creek but for all of central california. a failure of culverts at lagunitas creek tributary crossings of the earth and road conveying the district's water supply transmission pipeline could have a significant impact on water supply to large portions of marin county. regional priorities addressed by this project include regional water supply reliability/long-term sustainability; health of the bay and creeks; sediment management; and fisheries restoration for coho salmon and steelhead recovery. (additional narrative regarding specific manner in which this project addresses regional priorities can easily be provided upon request.) ","the project work will strengthen the route along which the marin municipal water districts (mmwds) nicasio transmission pipeline a major public water supply transmission line runs by strengthening the earth supporting the pipeline at culvert crossings and other sediment reduction sites. this will provide water supply reliability for mmwd's customers in marin county. the project will support the state's sediment tmdl for lagunitas creek by reducing fine sediment loading to streams supporting endangered coho salmon and threatened steelhead. sediment reduction will enhance habitat for the benefit of coho and steelhead by resulting in increased pool habitat and improved sediment quality at critical spawning riffle habitats. sediment loading reductions will also reduce turbidity and improve water quality conditions for all aquatic life in lagunitas creek. the project will also directly support the sediment tmdl by installing large wood and reconnecting the mainstem channel to its floodplain to sort and store fine sediment. the project will implement road drainage improvements by sizing them for the 100-year storm thereby reducing turbidity and other adverse impacts from stormwater flows from these roads. this project provides resource stewardship benefits as it will result in habitat protection and restoration in several aspects: 1) it will implement the construction of up to four winter habitat enhancement features for the benefit of endangered coho salmon and threatened steelhead. 2) the project will reduce fine sediment loading to streams supporting endangered coho salmon and threatened steelhead. 3) the project will also enhance floodplain sediment storage addressing the primary goals and objectives identified in the states lagunitas creek sediment tmdl. sediment reduction will enhance habitat for the benefit of coho and steelhead by resulting in increased pool habitat and improved sediment quality at critical spawning riffle habitats. sediment loading reductions will also reduce turbidity and improve water quality conditions for all aquatic life in lagunitas creek and in some cases remove barriers to fish passage. the project will have a public recreation benefit for hikers bicyclists and equestrians who use the recreational roads in the watershed. the road drainage improvements will also improve the road surfaces to more stable road beds and provide recreation reliability with the roads being open and passable. benefit/cost ratio as noted above phase i of the sediment reduction work along the cross marin trail is currently underway and was included in the bay areas proposition 84 round 2 irwm implementation grant. a rigorous benefit/cost analysis was conducted during the proposal development process which resulted in establishing a benefit/cost ratio of 3.09 for this project. as the sediment reduction work included with this current concept proposal is virtually identical in nature (just at different sites located along the stream reach) to the phase i work it is reasonable to assume the sediment reduction work proposed here would also achieve a 3.09 benefit/cost ratio. phase i of the winter habitat enhancement work proposed here is receiving funding from the california department of fish and wildlifes fishery restoration grant program. a detailed benefit/cost analysis has not been conducted or required for the winter habitat enhancement aspect of this proposed project however the benefits are similar and the costs are similar enough to the sediment reduction work costs and benefits that we can assume a high benefit/cost ratio for this proposed project likely close to the 3.09 benefit/cost ratio already determined as described above. integration this project presents a high degree of up-front integration as it addresses priorities associated with several functional areas including water supply/water quality stormwater/flood control and watershed/habitat. as described above the project will contribute measurably to water supply reliability water quality improvement watershed habitat restoration endangered species protection as well as providing stormwater and recreation benefits.

"north coast county water district drought preparedness and water conservation plan "," ","san mateo ","37.630269 |-122.489882 ","01/01/2015 ","12/31/2017 ","the plan has four sub-projects which are all located in the district's service area within the city of pacifica in san mateo county. ","elements of the drought preparedness and water conservation plan (plan) support the following project types: drinking water supply: the plan includes multiple elements which would reduce demands on existing drinking water sources and diversify future drinking water supplies. water reuse/recycling: the plan includes a recycled water enhancements and improvement sub-project which would increase recycled water use and decrease potable water demands. groundwater benefits: the plan includes a sub-project to develop a new groundwater source for the district. habitat restoration: the plan includes potential development of new groundwater and desalination water supply sources which could reduce demands on surface water sources thereby increasing water available for stream habitat. ","the north coast county water district (\"district\") is proposing a project concept referred to as a drought preparedness and water conservation plan and consists of multiple sub-projects each being actively pursued by the district to meet and reduce water demand during periods of drought and to provide operational flexibility and increased reliability for the district. the districts plan consists of four sub-projects (a through d) each discussed below: a. pipeline replacement program in 2013 the district initiated a study to develop a 20-year water master plan and capital improvement program (cip). a pipeline replacement program was identified and included as a high-priority cip project and the districts study identified specific pipelines which present the greatest risk for leaks and failures. the district has many pipelines in its system which are older asbestos-cement (ac) pipes and which are prone to leaks. the goal of this sub-project is to replace the oldest and most critical pipelines in the water system. b. supplemental groundwater supply this sub-project involves siting permitting engineering and construction-related activities associated with obtaining supplemental groundwater supplies in the districts service area. this includes possible construction of exploration well(s) and a new groundwater production well(s). the district is evaluating possible sites for construction of a new groundwater well on parcels owned by the district. the funding requested for this sub-project will be utilized for the cost to construct a groundwater exploration well and a production well including engineering permitting and construction costs. c. regional desalination feasibility study serving a coastal community the district is investigating the feasibility of working with neighboring communities including daly city san bruno montara water district and half moon bay for example to explore the costs and benefits of constructing a regional desalination treatment plant. this sub-project involves the cost to coordinate a regional study led by the district which would investigate potential sites for a desalination plant and expected costs and yields. d. recycled water enhancements and improvements the district has a partnership with the city of pacifica to utilize recycled water from pacificas calera creek recycling plant & collection system. the district receives recycled water from the plant and has constructed a recycled water pipeline and storage tank to supply recycled water to some district customers. the district plans to expand recycled water use in its southern service area. recently the district made improvements to the calera creek plant including adding pumps and valves. the next phase of recycled water expansion is to convert more potable customers to recycled water. the district is considering the potential for new recycled water service for the following locations:  terra nova high school  ortega elementary school  alma heights school  oddstad soccer fields an additional component of the districts recycled water enhancement and improvements sub-project is collaboration with the sfpuc to increase recycled water use for the sharp park golf course. scalability: projects a and d are highly scalable pending funding availability. these projects can be done in phases to address the highest priority pipelines/customers in earlier phases. ","the district serves a population of approximately 39000 people. the district purchases its water supply from the san francisco public utilities commission (sfpuc) which provides water from its hetch hetchy reservoir in the sierra nevada mountains and local bay area watersheds in the sunol area and on the san francisco peninsula. regional need: reduced dependence on sfpuc water supply if the district increases conservation and develops its own local water sources (groundwater and/or desalination) it could be less dependent on the water supply from the sfpuc system and increase supply reliability through diversification. regional need: improved reliability and emergency supply for district and neighbors in addition the district has emergency interties with three neighboring water districts: city of daly city the city of san bruno and westborough water district which also purchase water from the sfpuc system. an increase in water supply reliability for the district and increased water conservation potential could also serve to improve reliability for these neighboring districts during emergencies. operational/reliability needs : the districts water supply allocation from the sfpuc is delivered through a single pipeline that is approximately 4.2 miles in length and is aligned along the san andreas fault. because of this the districts source of supply and that pipeline are highly vulnerable to seismic activity. the districts plan includes elements that would increase water supply reliability and diversify supply sources so as to lessen its vulnerability to an outage of the sfpuc supply. water supply needs : in addition to its supply from the sfpuc the district holds surface water rights to san pedro creek located within its service area. however the san pedro creek surface water rights are limited and represent only 8% of its total water supply allocation from the sfpuc. the district has a need to diversify its water supply sources for improved flexibility and adaptability during drought conditions and climate change. conservation/water demand needs : current drought conditions and the potential for persistent future drought conditions make the need for conservation critical. the districts plan has sub-projects which would increase conservation by reducing leaks and by reducing demands. the pipeline replacement project would reduce leaks in older pipes. the recycled water project would replace potable consumption with recycled consumption thereby reducing potable demands. potential new water sources (groundwater desalination) would reduce demands on surface water sources of supply. ","without implementation of these projects the district will be primarily reliant upon the sfpuc for its entire water supply. the district receives this water through a pipeline aligned along the san andreas fault making this supply vulnerable to seismic activity. though the district has interties with neighboring water districts these districts are also primarily dependent upon the sfpuc for their water supply. having a diversified local supply of water would improve emergency scenarios. if future drought conditions persist and worsen without this plan the district would have few alternatives for water supply should the sfpucs supplies be limited. this plan includes potential development of groundwater and desalination; without these options the district will be primarily dependent on the sfpuc. without this plan opportunities to create significant increases in conservation may be limited. recently the district has implemented public education programs rebate programs and mandatory restrictions to promote conservation. such programs will continue in the future. however the conservation opportunities presented in this plan (replaced pipelines increased recycled water usage) represent more significant strategies for improving conservation. ","the districts plan will achieve multiple benefits. plan sub-projects support the management strategies in both the water supply and water quality and wastewater and recycled water functional areas identified in the bairwmp. water supply benefits: the plans benefits include increased water conservation diversification of water supply sources improved emergency water supply reliability reduced reliance on surface water and reduced reliance on imported water. the sub-projects of the plan target a reduction in potable water consumption through conservation of 10-15 million gallons per year which could potentially be realized with pipeline replacements (sub-project a) and increased recycled water usage (sub-project d). additional conservation of surface water resources on the order of 100 million gallons per year could potentially be realized through in-lieu use of supplemental groundwater supplies (sub-project b) and desalination (sub-project c). preliminary estimates for the total potential water savings represent about 10% of the districts average annual water demand. resource stewardship benefits: development of alternative water supply sources (groundwater desalination) would reduce demands on surface water resources potentially benefitting stream habitat quality. other: these projects are also collectively anticipated to reduce district staff time and resources used to repair pipelines; reduce demand on the sfpuc water supplies; and reduce costs to the district to purchase water from the sfpuc. benefit/cost ratio: the district estimates a benefit/cost ratio of 1.1 or better is achievable over the life of the sub-projects. a more rigorous benefit/cost analysis may be provided should the district be invited to move forward in the bay area irwmp process.

","water reuse/recycling: project will assess reuse of stormwater for irrigation; stormwater improvements: on-site management of stormwater run-off with green infrastructure improvements; groundwater benefits: treated stormwater which ultimately recharges groundwater; infiltration: the project area has soil types conducive for stormwater infiltration (>0.5 in/hr); habitat protection and restoration: restoration of historic creek and landscaping will include native plants which provides potential habitat for local species; flood protection: green infrastructure elements are designed to reduce surface flows and provide additional protection against flooding; related to a disadvantaged community: project is placed in a disadvantaged community (portola valley neighborhood). ","the upper yosemite creek daylighting project will daylight the headwaters of the historic yosemite creek to manage stormwater runoff from 110 acres of mclaren park. this san francisco public utilities commission (sfpuc) project will feature storage and infiltration facilities as well as a creek channel to convey stormwater and alleviate localized flooding issues. this is the first creek daylighting project initiated by the city and it has the added benefit of reintroducing natural habitat and providing opportunities for community learning and beautification. currently stormwater from the area drains into yosemite marsh and mcnab lake. when the water levels in yosemite marsh and mcnab lake reach the outlet elevations water spills into the combined sewer system. san franciscos combined sewer system collects transports and treats both wastewater and stormwater. during severe wet weather events the combined sewer system can become overwhelmed sometimes causing combined sewer discharges (csd) at permitted csd outfalls in the pacific ocean and the san francisco bay. the yosemite creek daylighting project is one of eight early implementation projects (eips) that the sfpuc is planning to construct as part of its sewer system improvement program (ssip). the common goal of the eips is to demonstrate the use of performance-based green infrastructure technologies to remove stormwater from the combined sewer system and attenuate peak flows. however the upper yosemite creek daylighting project is unique in that it is the only eip featuring creek daylighting. the information and expertise gained will be used to support the future of green infrastructure within the city of san francisco. the proposed scope for the yosemite creek daylighting project includes a creek channel that will flow along the northern edge of mclaren park from yosemite marsh the southern edge of the soccer field and the northern eastern and southern edges of the softball fields. overflow structures will be modified at yosemite marsh and mcnab lake to divert excess water to the new creek channel. to control flow velocity and increase habitat space bioretention facilities will be incorporated at various points along the creek. subsurface stormwater storage tanks will be installed at the northwestern edge of the softball fields. these subsurface tanks will be used to store stormwater and manage flow volumes heading for the combined sewer system. in addition opportunities to reuse captured stormwater to irrigate the soccer field or the creek channel are being investigated. the project team has been working closely with the sf recreation and parks department to integrate the creek into existing park uses. the project area is surrounded by a socio-economically disadvantaged community called portola valley. during the planning phase of this project public workshops and multiple small community group meetings were held to solicit public input and feedback. two online surveys were provided for additional public feedback on the project. public input has been used to refine the scope and aesthetic of the project. the project will feature an outdoor classroom to provide opportunities to learn about san francisco's historic creeks and the benefits of natural systems to treat and manage stormwater. the proposed scope incorporates design features to create habitat and biodiversity increase education and public involvement regarding water resource management promote neighborhood greening and enhance interagency project synergies. additional agencies that the project team worked with to refine and gain project approvals are the san francisco municipal transportation agency san francisco fire department and the san francisco department of public works. ","impervious surfaces such as buildings streets and parking lots cover most of san francisco preventing rainfall infiltration. over time creeks were buried and connected to the combined sewers and wetlands were infilled. instead of percolating into soils runoff now travels over impervious surfaces mobilizes pollutants and washes them into the sewer system or receiving water bodies. during heavy rain events stormwater runoff can contribute to localized flooding combined sewer discharges and the degradation of surface water quality. moreover the decrease in infiltration resulting from paved surfaces contributes to groundwater depletion. while water quality protection is the fundamental driver behind stormwater management well-designed stormwater controls (i.e. green infrastructure) offer many direct and ancillary benefits. some of the direct benefits include reducing and delaying the volumes and peak flows of stormwater reaching the sewer system. volume reduction and peak flow desynchronization can help reduce the number of stormwater overflows decrease flooding and protect water quality. green infrastructure projects have the potential to improve the capacity and efficiency of san francisco's treatment facilities. some of the ancillary benefits include enhancement of community spaces street beautification and improved conditions for bicyclists and pedestrians. green infrastructure also protects and creates more livable habitat for native wildlife and provides an opportunity to integrate stormwater management into the redevelopment of historic sites. yosemite creek daylighting is one of eight early implementation projects that will be placed throughout san francisco to provide the basis for performance maintenance and design standards for future city-wide green infrastructure initiatives. ","these early implementation projects are critical to gain public support for the ssip green infrastructure program inform the cost/benefit as utility assets and meet the goals for the city and county of san francisco to revitalize public streets create green jobs and improve wildlife habitat. ","previous studies conducted by the sfpuc identified needs for flood and stormwater management in the yosemite watershed. this project will decrease localized flooding and increase groundwater infiltration by capturing stormwater runoff and directing it to a new unlined creek channel bioretention facilities and subsurface storage tanks. in addition to watershed needs the project considered synergy opportunities and social and environmental factors. proposed enhancements to mclaren park include improved drainage of athletic fields and construction of a new pedestrian path that would provide safer access the park. the project will feature an outdoor classroom to provide opportunities to learn about san francisco's historic creeks and the benefits of treating and managing stormwater with natural systems. the headwater reach of the historic yosemite creek will be restored and bioretention facilities will create potential habitat using native plant species. subsurface storage tanks will be installed to retain excess stormwater and potential reuse for irrigation of mclaren park athletic fields or the creek channel will be investigated. the green infrastructure technologies included in the current scope of the preferred project alternative can manage stormwater from approximately 110 acres of mclaren park. the creek channel and inline bioretention areas are estimated to remove approximately 1 million gallons of stormwater per year from the combined sewer system (in a typical rainfall year). the underground storage facility is estimated to remove approximately 6.5 million gallons of stormwater per year. the reduction in peak flow resulting from a level of service storm (1.3 inches in three hours) is estimated to be approximately 1.2 million gallons per event. these are initial estimates based on unit green infrastructure performance metrics developed using numerous citywide sewer system master plan and ssip modeling analyses conducted using the city and county of san francisco hydrologic and hydraulic model10. these values will be refined through project-specific modeling during conceptual engineering and design. based on this preliminary estimate of annual stormwater volume removed and the estimated annualized life cycle cost the costs of the yosemite creek daylighting project is approximately $0.114 per gallon of stormwater removed. as one of sfpucs early implementation projects information obtained from this project will be used to develop plans for future installations of green infrastructure.

"san bruno groundwater development project ","this project includes the development and use of groundwater as a new source of supply for the city of san bruno through the design and construction of a new municipal groundwater supply well and treatment system. it is anticipated that this project could deliver approximately 800 acre feet per year (afy) of additional high-quality water supply to the city and allow the city to meet the terms of the westside basin groundwater storage and recovery project (gsr) agreement which provides drought benefits to the entire west bay sub-region. ","san mateo ","37.63202 |-122.42278 ","2/1/2013 ","12/31/2016 ","the project will be in the city of san bruno which is located in northern san mateo county in the west bay sub-region as identified in the bay area irwmp. the new municipal groundwater well and treatment system will be located on a city-owned parcel at the corner of mariner drive and commodore drive. the city overlies dwr basin (2-35) the westside groundwater basin. ","drinking water supply: this project will add approximately 800 afy of potable water to the city's water supply portfolio. this will increase and diversify the supply available to the city including during droughts or other supply interruptions. this project is also critical to the successful operation of the westside basin gsr project which is a critical drought relief project for the region. water quality improvement: the treatment system that will be developed to treat the produced groundwater will ensure that the groundwater that enters the city's water distribution system meets all primary and secondary mcls. groundwater benefits: the city currently manages its surface and groundwater sources conjunctively both locally and regionally as part of the south westside basin groundwater management plan (gwmp) and the westside basin gsr project. development of this project will assist the city to continue to do that in a cost-effective manner. ","objective this project will develop local groundwater resources for conjunctive use to increase public safety diversify the citys supply portfolio provide drought relief and increase supply reliability to the city and the region. the city has one of the lowest residential per capita water uses in the state (48 r-gpcd) which makes drought cutbacks difficult to achieve. this project will increase the citys water supply by as much as 800 afy allow the city to contribute to the westside basin gsr project and make the city and region more resilient to drought cutbacks. description this project includes the design and construction of a new municipal groundwater supply well and treatment system. this project will deliver 800 afy of treated water to the city. implementation of this project will diversify the citys water portfolio improve drinking water supply reliability provide drought relief and better allow the city to meet the health and safety needs of its water-efficient residents now and in the future as well as benefit the region as part of its participation in the westside basin gsr project. readiness to proceed the city initiated work on this project in 2013. to date the city has retained technical consulting assistance for the design and construction of the well and treatment system acquired land drilled a pilot hole to log stratigraphy constructed a monitoring well conducted water quality sampling and completed a ceqa analysis. the city is planning to issue bid documents for the well in spring 2015 and will begin construction by fall 2015. following construction and testing of the well the city will initiate design and construction of the treatment system with project completion anticipated in december 2016. function/physical benefit the project will produce 800 afy of high-quality water for potable use. the project will function as a lower cost supplemental source of supply to the city which will aid the city to balance its use of surface water during normal and drought years supply an additional source of water into the citys distribution system to meet demands in three different pressure zones increase the citys resilience to supply disruption and climate change impacts and ensure that the demands of the citys customers can be reliably met. this project will also increase the regions drought reliability through the citys participation in the westside basin gsr project. coordination/collaboration the city is committed to continuing to work with stakeholders in the westside basin and the region to effectively manage the basin including the development and implementation of management and monitoring programs in conformance with current state laws and local agreements including those for the implementation of the 2012 south westside basin gwmp the westside basin gsr project and future actions to be taken in response to the sustainable groundwater management act. specifically the entities that the city has been coordinating with include: the bay area water supply and conservation agency (bawsca); san francisco public utilities commission (sfpuc); daly city; south san francisco; and other stakeholders. ","local drought relief and water supply need: currently the citys customers use approximately 48 r-gpcd which means that during a significant drought and cutbacks to its surface water supply they have limited ability to reduce their consumption. the construction of this well will provide the city with a supplemental source of supply which will create a buffer for the city during droughts such as the one that we are currently experiencing. further since the city will have an alternative supply that it can rely on during normal and drought years this project will reduce the citys reliance on surface water which benefits the region and the delta and increase the citys resilience in the face of climate change. regional drought relief need: the city is a participant in the westside basin gsr project which is a 7.4 mgd drought-relief project that increases the supply reliability for the entire hetch-hetchy system including for all the bawsca agencies. the gsr agreement requires the city to pump 3350 afy at an average rate of 2.1 gpm during dry years in order to provide drought benefit to the region (i.e. when sfpuc declares a drought the city is required to use groundwater in lieu of taking surface water from the hetch-hetchy system which then frees up surface water for other system users). without this project the city will not have the capacity to produce sufficient groundwater which will impact the drought reliability of the region. water system reliability need: as was evidenced during the 2009 explosion of the pg&e; gas pipeline in the city which shut-down water service to a portion of the city and the recent water quality incident on the hetch-hetchy system wherein untreated water was delivered to many utilities in the region the city will benefit from a supplemental source of supply that can act as an additional source of supply during an emergency or other supply interruption from the hetch-hetchy system. this project will provide highly-treated water to multiple pressure zones within the city greatly increasing operational flexibility and system redundancy and reliability. water quality need: groundwater produced from the westside basin tends to have elevated levels of iron and manganese. therefore in order to deliver groundwater to its customers for potable use the city will have to design construct and operate a treatment system. economic need: currently the cost to purchase water from the hetch-hetchy system is approximately $1900 per acre-foot. in contrast groundwater from this project will cost approximately $400 per acre-foot to produce achieving a much more cost-effective water supply solution for the city. over 20 years this project will save the city $24000000. furthermore without this project and the ability to conjunctively use groundwater locally and as part of the westside basin gsr project the city and the region will suffer significant economic impacts during drought. ","local water supply / drought relief impact if this project is not implemented the city will remain vulnerable to drought which will have significant economic and other impacts. the city will also be vulnerable to supply interruptions or water quality breaches on the hetch-hetchy system. regional drought impact without this project the city will not have the capacity to produce the amount of groundwater that it is required to do under the westside basin gsr project agreement which will impact the drought reliability of the region and have a major economic impact. economic impact the city will be negatively impacted economically as the cost to purchase water from the hetch-hetchy system is significantly more expensive than the cost to produce groundwater (i.e. currently the cost to purchase water from the hetch-hetchy system is approximately $1900 per acre-foot while groundwater costs approximately $400 per acre-foot to produce). over 20 years this project will save the city $24000000. further to the extent that the westside basin gsr project is not able to effectively function due to the citys lack of production capacity there will be significant economic impacts to the region. ","by adding an additional local and drought-proof supply source this project immediately achieves the following benefits locally (and by extension to the region) that are consistent with state and regional priorities: immediate drought preparedness this project increases the citys water supply portfolio by 800 afy to include a more drought-proof groundwater source that will benefit the citys customers that currently use 48 r-gpcd. further this project ensures that the city can meet the terms of its westside basin gsr agreement which requires the city to pump 3350 afy at an average rate of 2.1 gpm during dry years in order to provide drought benefit to the region (i.e. when sfpuc declares a drought the city is required to groundwater in lieu of taking surface water from the hetch-hetchy system which then frees up surface water for other users of the hetch-hetchy system). increases local water supply reliability and the delivery of safe drinking water this project adds 800 afy of treated groundwater to the citys available supplies. groundwater management through the implementation of the south westside basin gwmp and the westside basin gsr project the city continues to work with other basin users to manage the westside basin and to provide drought benefits locally and to the region. improvement of water quality by adding a groundwater treatment system the city will be able to tap into an underutilized resource and distribute high-quality water to its customers. drinking water treatment and distribution by adding wellhead treatment the city will have access to 800 afy of treated groundwater that meets all mcls that can be served within three pressure zones within the city.

","our restoration projects improve water quality by reducing bank-side erosion and filtering storm water runoff into streams; restore and protect habitat by planting native plants along bare or degraded stream banks and wetland edges; provide flood protection by reducing invasive plant populations along stream banks; and educate and empower area students and community members to be active stewards of their land. ","for the past 23 years point blues straw program has provided award-winning watershed science education including professional-quality habitat restoration for thousands of bay area students and teachers. straw addresses the social component of stewardship through direct community involvement with practices that build resilient healthy watersheds. we propose to implement multiple priority native planting and invasive plant removal projects in both riparian and wetland-upland transition zone habitat types around the san pablo bay and san francisco bay watersheds with schools and other community members. we provide interactive habitat-specific education to all participants and extensive professional development to participating teachers. these educational practices enable straw to provide meaningful opportunities for many bay area school communities to engage in projects that actively help their communities adapt to a changing climate. substantial monitoring is incorporated into our project to confirm the effectiveness of our practices for educational value vegetation establishment success and wildlife benefit. straw will engage 9933 project participants in restoring 25.08 hectares of riparian and wetland-upland habitat. eligibility factors: 1. point blues straw program is currently a component of the 2013 bay area irwm plan. further description of how this project addresses the goals and objectives of the bairwm plan is described in the bairwmp goals section. 2. straw is 100% ready to proceed. we have several pending project sites that do not require any environmental documentation or permitting. planting designs and work plans will be finalized and installed upon award of funds. implementation will begin during the 2016-2017 winter season. project work and expenditure of funds will be completed by 2020. 3. we have substantial in-kind volunteer labor match to meet the 25% upfront match requirement. 4. straw has clearly defined physical benefits and associated metrics. 5. straw currently has a dwr-accepted benefit/cost analysis from the previous irwm funding cycle of $14.22/$1 based on habitat creation and water quality improvement. 6. straw is able to pay our equitable share of the consultant costs for the regional application. 7. straw is widely supported through regional collaboration with many public and private agencies operating and managing properties around san pablo bay and san francisco bay. in addition our restoration practices are derived from and have guided the pertinent plans and frameworks for the region. our dedicated network of teachers and community members around the bay area are ready to implement projects. 8. straw projects meet multiple objectives and achieve multiple benefits in various irwm functional categories including climate change (shoreline sustainability) health of the bay and creeks sediment management invasives management and riparian and fisheries restoration. 9. straw requests $5500000 with a 25% match of $1375000 for a total project cost of $6875000 over five years. the project is scalable by number and size of projects depending on available funds. 10. straw has proven to be an impactful and effective community-based habitat restoration and education program throughout the bay area. participating schools and partners come from nine bay area counties: alameda contra costa marin napa san francisco san mateo santa clara solano and sonoma. ","straw habitat restoration projects address the regional needs regarding water supply water quality storm water management flood protection and resource stewardship through community implemented habitat restoration. bay area streams and wetlands have experienced widespread degradation from development impacts such as polluted storm water runoff loss of habitat erosion and sedimentation problems invasive species increased flood severity and decreased biodiversity. as a result the san francisco bay estuary is one of the most modified estuaries in the united states (goals project 1999). many rural rural streams around the san francisco bay area are ecologically compromised due to a lack of the plant communities that provides a mosaic of mid and upper canopy habitat structures. the canopy these plant communities provide shade riparian areas to keep the water cool which mitigates high summer temperatures. in addition these communities root structures help decompact the soil increasing waters ability to adequately infiltrate into the water table. this compromised condition reduces a riparian systems ability to keep water temperatures cool and absorb rainfall during the wet season. at a local scale this ultimately reduces water availability for agricultural operations that rely on surface water catchment and wildlife. our projects are in watersheds with severe water quality needs. many watersheds are categorized with either a 303d listing or tmdl designation for excess sediment and other pollutants. in addition to sediments storm water runoff also carries herbicides pesticides excess nutrients trash and toxic particulates from roadways into waterways. established native vegetation on rural creek banks captures and filters sediments and other pollutants from overland flows. non-native invasive plants often contribute to a reduction in water capacity of urban streams because these species are prone to block or clog flood channels. this relates to the regional priority of invasive management. for many of our north bay watersheds excess sediment is also a primary contributing factor to flooding problems because of the reduction in flood water capacity in channels due to the accrual of sediments in the channel beds. much of the existing creek and wetland-upland transition zones in the bay area are denuded degraded or otherwise low-functioning. functioning riparian corridors provide many critical services and benefits for both wildlife and human communities including habitat connectivity thermal refugia flood protection and storm water filtration that improves water quality. riparian and wetland areas with degraded conditions are not providing these essential resources and benefits which relates to the regional priority of riparian and fisheries restoration. past land management practices of development and removing native vegetation from the land have greatly reduced the landscapes ability to absorb and sequester atmospheric carbon. one of the most heavily impact systems with a high potential for sequestering atmospheric carbon are riparian forests. the reestablishment of woody perennial vegetation will greatly increase these systems ability to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic climate change. just as we do not expect children to play in baseball games without practicing first we should not expect children to become democratic citizens without also practicing first. unfortunately there are limited opportunities within the standard school system for students to see how their learning applies and connects to their community and the world. additionally community members who are disconnected from schools see students as people who could make a difference in the future not now. meaningful shared work among students teachers and the community happens few and far between further isolating ourselves and weakening our communities. students are constantly presented with accounts of increasing natural disasters rising temperatures and drought in recent decades (sobel 2006). with a continual increase in major environmental challenges that have resulted from human impact it is essential for students to become environmentally literate through their prek-12 education to be ready to face challenges now and in the future (nelson 2013). not only is it important for students to become environmentally literate for the future of conservation but for reasons within social justice and community empowerment as well. science acts as a gate-keeping subject as mastery within science can lead to more wealth and a higher socioeconomic status (dimick 2012 p.1009). science education can thus be a leverage point for students in school (dimick). coupling science inquiry with social action projects is a perfect blend of academic empowerment currently and lead to political empowerment in the future (dimick). unfortunately science education is not equally provided within all schools. teachers and students in underserved schools are in need of engaging and meaningful science education opportunities. one such need teachers have is finding support in adopting new standards and curriculum. as the next generation science standards roll out across the state teachers are searching for resources and opportunities to meet these standards. the standards are process and inquiry-based and many teachers feel overwhelmed by additional requirements and new ways of teaching. normal 0 false false false en-us x-none x-none /* style definitions */ table.msonormaltable

hectares of critically needed riparian systems and wetland complexes in the bay area to improve water quality wildlife habitat open spaces and the quality of life for the over seven million people who live in the area. in addition the uncertainties of climate change call for innovative and scientifically sound habitat restoration techniques that ensure projects in bay area watersheds will be as resilient as possible. we will design our straw planting days with community volunteers using our innovative climate-smart restoration practices for riparian and wetland-upland transition zone habitat projects (gardali et al. in review). if these projects are not implemented 25.08 hectares of riparian and wetland systems will not:  adequately filter sediment and will contribute excess levels within

resulting from the root structures of established vegetation in addition over 9933 community members many of them from underserved areas will not receive the opportunity to learn about the benefits of healthy functioning riparian and wetlands systems and the numerous benefits they provide to their communities. these community members also likely will not play an active role in ensuring their watersheds are resilient to a changing climate. ","straw habitat restoration projects provide the critical physical benefits of increased water supply water quality improvement storm water management increased flood protection and increased resource stewardship through community implemented habitat restoration. all straw projects are designed to: 1) control erosion and sedimentation; 2) buffer storm water runoff to help reduce point and non-point source pollution into waterways; 3) improve watershed vegetation health and quality; 4) increase habitat value and connectivity for wildlife; 5) increase resilience of ecosystems regardless of future climate scenarios; 6) maximize the amount of atmospheric carbon sequestered per hectare treated; and 7) increase in local water supply through a decrease in surface water evaporation and an increase in groundwater infiltration and 8) educate and engage local communities in the implementation of critical creek and wetland revegetation projects. through this project a total of 25.08 hectares of creek and wetland-upland habitat will be improved and 9933 people will learn about the environment and participate in habitat improvement projects. 1) controlling erosion and sedimentation contributes many benefits to water quality and flood and stormwater management. many of straws active projects are in watersheds with either a 303d listing or tmdl designation for excess sediment and other pollutants. for many of our north bay watersheds excess sediment is also a primary contributing factor to flooding problems because of the reduction in flood water capacity in channels due to the accrual of sediments in the channel beds. established native vegetation on rural creek banks captures and filters sediments from overland flows. potential sediment inputs to creeks are calculated using the universal soil loss equation (usle). typical rural watersheds yield 0.3 tons of sediment per hectare. this sediment will filter through our completed restoration projects reducing excess sediment inputs. the straw projects impact is quantified by the area of creek bank restored at the time of planting. 2) buffering storm water runoff increases the water quality of our waterways and improves storm water management of urban creeks. planted wetland and riparian vegetation improves the quality of storm water runoff through filtration by established native vegetation. restoration of 15000 ft. of stream with approximately 0.5 cfs flow will provide the treatment equivalent to a storm water treatment plant designed to treat 1.2 million gallons of runoff per day (riley et al. 2009). this benefit is quantified by the area of creek bank restored at the time of planting to calculate the number of gallons of runoff filtered. 3) improving watershed vegetation health and quality increases the benefits of flood protection and resource stewardship. these projects provide lasting protection through flood prevention design practices that maximize native vegetation establishment while removing/discouraging species prone to block or clog flood channels. established native vegetation inhibits future proliferation of non-native invasive plants that often contribute to a reduction in water capacity of streams. this flood protection benefit is quantified at the time of removal of invasive plants by measuring the area of creek treated and the volume of invasive vegetative matter removed. this resource stewardship benefit is measured by reaching 70% survival of installed native plants each year for three years after installation. 4) increasing habitat value and connectivity for wildlife provides benefits to resource stewardship by installing native plants in denuded degraded or otherwise low-functioning creek and wetland-upland transition areas. this benefit is quantified by measuring area of creek or wetland planted calculating change in native woody plant diversity of restored creeks measuring wildlife response in riparian song bird populations over time and annual photo-monitoring for three years after installation. 5) increasing resilience of ecosystems regardless of future climate scenarios benefits resource stewardship by utilizing climate-smart planting designs to ensure that these projects have diverse planting palettes making them as robust and resilient as possible. this benefit is measured at time of plant installation by calculating increase in native woody plant diversity. 6) maximizing the amount of atmospheric carbon sequestered benefits resource stewardship by installing native woody vegetation. this benefit is calculated at the time of installation using the number species and area planted to determine the amount carbon sequestered by the plants installed. planting 25.08 hectares with riparian forest will sequester 90.54 metric tonnes of co2 per year. 7) increasing deep-rooted vegetation and canopy cover benefits water quantity by substantially reducing surface water evaporation and increasing groundwater infiltration. the benefit will be determined by a 70% increase of canopy cover over the life of the project as well as a 70% survival of installed species. 8) educating and engaging local communities many of them from underserved areas in the implementation of critical habitat restoration projects benefits resource stewardship by providing a concrete means of learning about and affecting positive change in our watersheds and adapting to climate change. additionally straw supports teachers in many ways. in the hefty challenge of integrating and meeting next generation science standards we work with teachers one-on-one and support them in identifying ways to meet ngss through straw and beyond. through our work with underserved schools we connect students with science in approachable fun and memorable ways. we not only teach science through our program but we provide students with the chance to see themselves as scientists. this benefit is measured by number of participants and volunteers in our projects and their change in environmental knowledge and attitudes at the time of their participation. this project will engage and educate 9933 participants who will demonstrate a 75% increase in environmental knowledge.

","the nbwra sub-regional project will provide 6000-6100 afy of recycled water for municipal environmental and agricultural uses. the project includes 7.3 miles of distribution pipelines rehabilitation of a 0.5-million gallon storage tank 7.85 mgd of additional tertiary treatment capacity relining 4300 feet of pipe to allow for increased supply and a significant upgrade to an existing pump station to enable service to two distinct distribution zones. the project offsets the use of potable water in marin sonoma and napa counties (russian river water and groundwater) offsets surface water and groundwater used in sonoma and napa counties to support landscape and agricultural irrigation and also provides water for restoration of the napa-sonoma salt marsh. the project components for grant funding consideration are part of the larger regional nbwrp included in the bay area irwmp: http://bairwmp.org/projects/north-bay-water-reuse-program. the specific components within this application include: lgvsd recycled water supply resiliency project: lgvsd will expand its recycled water facility to supply mmwd's existing recycled water system. the project increases the tertiary capacity at lgvsd by 4 mgd to a total of 5.4 mgd. this project would allow mmwd to distribute more recycled water to its existing irrigation customers (currently using potable water 500-600 afy) and increase the reliability of those supplies because of fewer operational and water quality issues from the new expanded plant. novato recycled water central service area expansion the project will increase the tertiary capacity of novato sd's davidson street water recycling facility from 0.85 to 1.70 mgd. this includes the installation of a third sand filter module and expansion of nmwd's recycled water facilities to serve additional schools parks homeowners associations and a golf course by extending approximately 5.7 miles of 8-18 pipelines and rehabilitation of an out-of-service 500000-gallon water tank. this project will expand recycled water delivery by 300 afy and provide 200 afy of potable water offset. expansion of petaluma recycled water system: the project will increase the tertiary capacity of petalumas ellis creek water recycling facility from 4.8 to 7.8 mgd providing 3300 afy for expanding urban and agricultural irrigation. this includes the installation of a second sand filter module and addition of a third channel of ultraviolet lights for disinfection. the project includes expansion of the urban recycled water distribution to serve schools parks and greenbelts by extending a 16 pipeline 1.6 miles in northeastern petaluma. this project will provide an additional 51 afy of potable water offset. sonoma valley recycled water supply and reliability project: svcsd will reline a 24 reinforced concrete pipeline due to operational issues that are limiting the amount of recycled water that can be beneficially used. the new cured-in-place pipe will have an operating pressure of 100 pounds per square inch (psi) and will be able to withstand spikes of 300 psi. with the relining svcsd will provide an additional 200 afy a more reliable recycled water supply to be beneficially used for agricultural uses and habitat restoration.napa sd recycled water pump station north/south split: napa sd has worked with napa county and lcwd to extend recycled water service into the mst area to provide up to 2137 afy for landscaping and irrigation purposes and across the napa river to provide up to 1800 afy for landscaping and irrigation purposes. the north/south split is a necessary upgrade to accommodate the increased distribution of recycled water (up to 1700 afy) to manage the necessary water pressures and to protect the new distribution lines from hydraulic transients. the project does not provide benefits to a dac. ","the north san pablo bay region of napa sonoma and marin counties faces serious long-term challenges in providing reliable water supplies. the area is not served by federal water projects surface and groundwater sources are limited and some local groundwater basins are over pumped. urban agricultural and environmental demands exacerbated by ongoing drought exceed the regions ability to provide a reliable sustainable and economical water supply. a clean dependable water supply is also needed to continue the restoration of vital tidal wetlands at the base of the san pablo bay watershed that serve in a vital ecological role as nurseries for fisheries and wintering areas for migratory water fowl. the effects of climate change are further stressing the areas water supplies with reduced diversions from the russian river unpredictable rainfall and fluctuating temperatures. agricultural land use is expected to remain relatively constant over a 20-year planning period and all three county governments in the study area have explicit policies in place to protect agricultural lands. the regions wastewater treatment agencies have long faced strict limits on the timing and quality of the treated effluent they can send to san pablo bay. by treating wastewater to the strict levels required for reuse these agencies can recycle the water in productive ways that augment local water supply and help protect limited potable water resources. drought conditions have increased recycled water demands and the capacity of traditional potable water supply diversions and conveyance from the russian river and the state water project cannot be increased at this time. increasing long-term concerns such as climate variability and degrading groundwater quality provide additional motivation for addressing future water needs in marin sonoma and napa counties. the goals for water and resource conservation in these county general plans and each of the nbwra member agencies include recycling and water conservation. the north bay region has no new surface water or groundwater supplies making recycled water an important component in meeting future water demands in the region. the nbwra sub-regional project will address the following bay area irwmp priority regional needs: reinforce/enhance water supply capacity  6000  6100 afy of new recycled water supply in the north bay for municipal environmental and agricultural use including potable water offset of existing surface water and groundwater sources that are strained. regional water reliability/long-term sustainability  6000  6100 afy of new drought-resistant recycled water supply in the north bay for potable water offset and agricultural use. the nbwra sub-regional project addresses long-term drought preparedness by offsetting potable water demands with recycled water and enhancing the overall regional suite of water supplies for the area's diverse water needs. health of bay and creeks - 5500  5600 afy of treated wastewater no longer being discharged to san pablo bay to reduce nitrogen/nutrient loading; provides 200 afy of freshwater to restore former salt ponds in the napa-sonoma marsh. protection of water source areas - contributes to groundwater preservation in sonoma and napa counties by providing over 1700 afy of new recycled water supply to offset groundwater currently used for both potable and agricultural demands. climate change  new recycled water capacity may be used to irrigate future horizontal levees that will protect lgvsd facilities including the recycled water plant from sea level rise and flooding impacts. ","without implementation of the nbwrp the north san pablo bay region will continue to face water supply shortages that will affect municipal and industrial customers the agricultural industry and environmental restoration efforts. the areas limited surface water resources will be strained to provide sufficient local and imported supplies and groundwater basins will be overdrafted particularly in times of drought. highly treated recycled water produced by the nbwra facilities would not be put to the most beneficial use. napa sds north/south split component is a critical missing element to the distribution of 1700 af of recycled water to areas that currently draw water from overdrafted groundwater aquifers in napa and sonoma counties. this project will offset these overdrafts. the proposed modifications are required for recycled water deliveries in order to project infrastructure by maintaining minimum pressures in the mst and lcwd distribution systems providing instrumentation and controls necessary to interact with the mst booster pump station to ensure the connecting pipelines and new equipment are not damaged and protecting the lcwd distribution system from hydraulic transients. if petalumas tertiary facility is not expanded there will be insufficient tertiary recycled water to meet peak day demands for drought-sensitive agricultural users. without expansion of the recycled water distribution pipelines several schools and parks will not be able to utilize recycled water and continue to impose a significant demand upon limited potable water resources. ","the nbwra sub-regional project will provide 6000  6100 afy of recycled water supply to the north bay area (800-900 afy in marin county 3500 afy in sonoma county and 1700 afy in napa county). this recycled water offsets potable water from: 1) the russian river; and 2) groundwater in napa county. the project will also take agricultural users off of strained surface water diversions from local creeks and limited groundwater supplies in sonoma and napa counties where overdraft and saline intrusion are issues. the project will reduce peak potable water demands reduce reliance on imported surface water and reduce treated wastewater discharge into san pablo bay by 5500  5600 afy. recycled water from the project would be delivered starting in march 2016 with project completion by october 2018. also expansion of the recycled water production capacity would allow the project to serve agricultural users that have played a vital role in the local economy for over 150 years. ii. water quality the nbwrp includes improved levels of wastewater treatment and reduced discharges of treated wastewater into north san pablo bay. the project will reduce treated wastewater discharge into san pablo bay by 5500 - 5600 afy reducing nitrogen/nutrient loading. lgvsds expanded use of tertiary treated effluent will assist in meeting its new npdes permit no discharge requirements. the additional recycled water capacity provided by lgvsds plant expansion may be used to irrigate future horizontal levees that will protect lgvsd facilities including the recycled water plant from flooding impacts and sea level rise. the project will provide 200 afy of tertiary recycled water to facilitate restoration of several of the former salt ponds at the california department of fish and wildlife napa-sonoma marsh wildlife area. the nbwra sub-regional project expects to have a benefit-cost ratio similar to other recycled water projects recently undertaken in the north bay area. the project can you provide project benefit/cost analysis information for the prop 84 application.

","the program proposes groupings of projects in all four irwm subregions that integrate three of the four irwm functional areas (watershed/habitat flood protection/stormwater wastewater/recycling). the habitat and flood elements of several projects include ties to stormwater improvements and potential re-use of wastewater. ","the program proposes groupings of projects in all four irwm subregions that integrate three of the four irwm functional areas. the program is highly collaborative involving a diverse partnership of flood protection habitat restoration and wastewater entities. all projects are currently included in the 2014 plan (with two updates) and the partners are prepared to provide an equitable share of the consulting cost of an application. the program is expected to provide a significant non-state match (at least 25%). grant management project monitoring and evaluation plans reporting and data management will be performed by scc in collaboration with sfei. the program is scalable with numerous options for optimally configuring projects within each subregion: north bay  novato creek area and environs the novato creek phase i fluvial-tidal wetlands restoration project and the bel marin keys wetland restoration project meet complementary goals of flood management adaptation to sea level rise and habitat restoration on lower novato creek in marin county. both projects are included in the bariwm plan are working with the novato sanitary district to incorporate reuse of treated wastewater and can involve community-based restoration (through straw). novato creek phase i would restore approximately 80-plus acres of former tidal marsh along the freshwater/saltwater mixing gradient and reestablish important ecological function and fluvial processes with the historic floodplain. the project will demonstrate multi-objective benefits for both habitat enhancement and flood control by combining urban flood protection for downtown novato with shoreline and habitat adaptation to sea level rise. the bel marin keys wetland restoration project will construct flood protection necessary to restore a mix of wetlands habitats on the 1576-acre bel marin keys property preparing the site for seasonal and tidal marsh restoration. it will construct a new flood management levee to separate tidal and non-tidal areas assist in the protection of the adjacent bel marin keys residential community from flooding and develop approximately 360 acres of seasonal wetlands. east bay  eden landing/hayward marsh complex the eden landing portion of the south bay salt pond restoration (sbspr) project and the hayward marsh restoration project are both included in the bay area irwm plan. these projects can involve community-based restoration in partnership with save the bay. for the sbspr portion of this project large-scale tidal wetland restoration (over 2000 acres) will be implemented in conjunction with an innovative bayside berm approach (a fema-compliant feature that functions like a natural barrier island) to provide flood protection for thousands of homes and businesses. restored interior wetlands would be used to dampen the incoming tides allowing inner levees within the ponds to be subject to much lower water levels and wave heights thereby providing multiple layers of tidal flood protection and vastly improved habitat values. for the hayward marsh portion of this project rehabilitation of the capacity and functions of the bayside ponds would result in the rehabilitation of wetlands that reduce the ammonia load in san francisco bay improve habitat for critical species such as the california least tern improve the resiliency of the local shoreline the wastewater distribution system and flood control features to assist with sea level rise. peninsula  safer bay and ravenswood restoration the san francisquito creek jpas safer bay project and the sbspr projects ravenswood complex in menlo park will provide critical flood risk management infrastructure and facilitate large-scale tidal marsh restoration. though new to the plan the safer bay project is coupled with the sbspr project and can be integrated through an update. the safer bay project will provide tidal flood protection to east palo alto menlo park and palo alto homes private businesses public lands and facilities of the state with the objective of protecting these communities against tidal surges and the impacts of 50 years of projected sea level rise. habitat protection and restoration are primary objectives through direct restoration design elements (such as horizontal levees and increased transitional ecotone habitat) and by providing flood protection measures to ensure future restoration in adjacent sbspr project ponds r1 r2 and r3 do not increase tidal flood risk to the community. resilience features include: upland fill material that may be used to create a levee with an outboard slope ratio up to 30:1 (horizontal: vertical) enhancing transition zone between the ecosystems of the restored wetlands and the adjacent upland infrastructure. public access enhancements may include upgrades to the bay trail. south bay - mountain view shoreline the south bay salt pond restoration project in mountain view includes large-scale tidal marsh restoration while providing critical flood risk management infrastructure for adjacent residences and businesses. the project area consists of a cluster of former salt ponds (pond a1 pond a2w charleston slough) the levees surrounding each pond some of the fringe marsh outside of the pond and slough levees permanente creek and mt. view slough. restoration activities include breaches of levees at various locations creation of wildlife habitat features and other levee alterations to improve the overall ecological conditions of pond a1 pond a2w and charleston slough. resilience features include: upland fill material that may be used to create upland transition zones slope ratios of up to 30:1 to buffer ecosystems and provide resiliency to sea level rise by providing wetland migration accommodation space and reducing wave run-up impacts for adjacent levees. viewing and interpretative platforms and trails would be established to improve recreation and public access to the pond cluster. alternative projects that could be integrated if desired include the richardson bay engineered bay beach shoreline demonstration project to develop alternatives to shoreline armoring by using coarse grain bay beaches ($500k to $2.2 million). ecotone transition slope revegetation could be implemented for the sears point wetland restoration project ($350k). the east bay regional park districts albany beach and bay point restoration and public access projects ($500k-$1.2 million and $500k-$1.1 million) are both in later stages of design and have significant non-state matching funds available. more information on these is available upon request. ","the historic loss of wetlands in the region along with the multiple water quality flood protection and habitat benefits they provide presents one of the greatest ecological and economic challenges the region faces. in addition climate change and in particular sea level rise present risks to tens of billions of dollars of infrastructure. this proposal will develop site-specific solutions to paired flood control habitat water quality and re-use challenges while developing and testing regionally-relevant techniques necessary to address the future impacts of sea level rise. the program responds to four of the regional priorities including: climate change: the program fits all the criteria for a shoreline sustainability climate change project. it is the outgrowth of several regional vulnerability assessments including work by the pacific institute and bcdc and directly builds on the baylands ecosystem habitat goals recommendations regarding climate change; demonstrates an ability to reduce shoreline vulnerability to climate change addressing potential future sea level rise and documenting metrics of benefit; demonstrates innovation in testing new resilience strategies; provides data and proof of concept for regional strategies; and includes ecosystem adaptation and re-use of sediment and wastewater. health of the bay and creeks: the program provides direct water quality benefits to the bay reducing pollutants and enhancing fisheries and native and endemic wildlife populations around the bay margin. it protects restores and rehabilitates watershed and bay processes reintroducing more natural sediment and freshwater flows improving floodplain connectivity and reducing shoreline (and marsh edge) erosion. sediment management: the program helps address conflicting goals with sediment management in particular regarding re-use of dredged material in the bay; integrates habitat concerns through beneficial sediment re-use; and anticipates being able to determine the incremental costs of beneficial re-use in these settings. invasives management: the program assists with the management of invasive spartina a species of regional concern. ","without the proposed projects progress in reversing the historic loss of baylands habitats called for by the bairwmp the baylands ecosystem habitat goals basin plan ccmp and other regional plans will be greatly slowed and in places halted. in addition the impacts of sea level rise are projected to be most greatly felt along shorelines without established integrated shoreline solutions that can jointly achieve habitat goals while providing shoreline protection; these projects represent the most significant currently-planned contributions to ensuring that resilience in the region. the projects all include testing of key design and engineering questions crucial to future shoreline sustainability including: restoring multiple components of diverse complex baylands facilitating improved re-use of in-channel and bay sediment incorporating re-use of treated wastewater into restoration designs effectively constructing and enhancing terrestrial transition zones and high-tide refugia and designing self-sustainability into marsh and planting designs. without the implementation of these projects the regions ability to move forward quickly with shoreline resilience measures at a significant scale will be reduced and delayed. restoration sites will not be able to establish as quickly as they need to ensure their best chance of keeping up with sea level rise. and crucial technical permitting and management questions will remain unanswered further delaying similar action around the region.

","this project will increase drinking water supply by increasing water recycling for non-potable uses to offset potable water currently serving these uses. the water quality in san francisco bay will be improved by reducing nutrient loading. the aquatic habitat of the bay will be protected through reduced point source discharges and the hayward marsh area will benefit from restoration. flood control levees in hayward marsh will also be improved by the project. ","recent evidence suggests that san francisco bays resistance to its high level of nutrient loadings is weakening. consequently the san francisco water quality control board has indicated interest in developing nutrient loading allocations in the next 5-10 years. see ref. doc. #1. similar nutrient removal strategies in other regions of the u.s. can approach $50-100 billion to implement through capital improvements improved monitoring/assessment and nutrient trading. this project will reduce nutrient inputs into the bay through implementation of: a. zeolite-anammox total nitrogen removal system. construct two full-scale or intermediate treatment systems and multiple pilot scale treatment systems at several bay area locations to remove nutrients and advance this technology by: i) refining pilot plant data for accurate construction cost estimates; and ii) generating enough bio-zeolite (zeolite colonized with bacteria) to seed further full scale systems. three strengths of aquatic ammonia discharges can be de-ammonified: side stream (high strength) mainstream (medium) and re-used water (low). see ref. document #2. requesting $1.5m. b. mobile advanced treatment pilot. construct small scale and/or trailer mounted wastewater treatment units at multiple locations to test advanced wastewater treatment (staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor system [saf-mbr] and coupled aerobic-anoxic nitrous decomposition operation [cando]) to remove nutrients and other constituents reduce energy use and enhance energy recovery. see ref. doc. #3. requesting $1.5m. c. hayward marsh restoration. rehabilitate a 145 acre marsh on the eastern shore of sf bay using reclaimed wastewater to improve wildlife habitat reduce wastewater nutrient loads to san francisco bay and improve flood control through levee strengthening. approximately 2 mgd of wastewater will be used for this project and up to 20 mgd duding wet weather. requesting $5m. d. moored sensors. install robust water quality sensors network at strategic locations in san francisco bay to improve assessment and prediction of bay conditions and provide early warning of adverse swings. requesting $2m. e. nutrient optimization at existing plants. initiate nutrient removal projects above and beyond regulatory requirements by partially funding capital improvements (pumps aerobic digesters etc) at some of the 37 bay area potws based on the amount of nutrient removal to be accomplished per dollar. bacwa would administer the program and the potws would implement the facility improvements. requesting $2m. f. regional recycling. potential water recycling projects for this grant round are listed below. recommendations for specific projects for grants will be as the screening process is finalized. facilities and grant amounts will be equitably distributed among the four bay area sub-regions. requesting $15m total. 1. benicia valero oil refinery cooling water 2100 af/yr. total $16m. requesting $2.8m. 2. derwa recycled water project pump st. 1 ph. 2 2900 af/yr. total $15m. requesting $5m. 3. south marin recycled water system 100 af/yr. total $3m. requesting $2.25m. 4. palo alto recycled water project 900 af/yr. total $35m. requesting $5m. 5. redwood city rwp phase 2 central city 274 af/yr. total $8.5m. requesting $4m. 6. sfpuc regional recycled water capacity improv 2336 af/yr. total $30m. requesting $3m. 7. nbwra sub-regional project 6300-6400 af/yr. total $24.5m requesting $6.25m. 8. sharon heights satellite treatment plant 197 af/yr. total $13.9m requesting $3m. ","the san francisco bay estuary is enriched with nutrients but thus far has not suffered from adverse environmental impacts such as eutrophication. studies in recent years show signs that turbidity may be decreasing potentially breaking down the resiliency to nutrients. capital costs to reduce nutrient loads from 37 publicly owned treatments works (potws) in the bay area differ in costs by billions of dollars. a technology based regulatory approach that requires all potws to reduce nutrients by 75% (to 5-7 mg/l n effluent concentration) or 90% (2 mg/l n) would cost up to $7.5 billion (falk 2011). targeted options may be as effective at much lower costs if advances in treatment technology and assessment tools can be improved. water supply enhancements are critically needed during the ongoing drought in california and for future dry periods. drought proof supplies such as recycled water are particularly valuable as they do not require importing water from distant watersheds. business sectors are experiencing water cutbacks and economic losses that could be alleviated somewhat by development of additional recycled water supplies and capacity. without increased water supplies economic losses and hardship on residential customers could increase in the future. flood control improvements and marsh restoration are needed along the bayfront to upgrade aging infrastructure and adapt to a sea level rise of two to five feet by 2100. many of the existing levees were built around the same time as when the earliest cities were incorporated. improvements to flood control infrastructure are needed to protect businesses and residents living in low lying areas near the bay to help avoid large flood losses. ","nutrients - studies in recent years show signs that turbidity may be decreasing potentially breaking down the resiliency to nutrients. the adjacent delta region has already experienced significant declines for pelagic organisms due to multiple factors including nutrient enrichment (interagency ecological program 2008-2013). without an aggressive approach by regulators and stakeholders to develop and implement an effective nutrient strategy there will be uncertainty about the long lasting ecosystem health of san francisco bay. increased regulation of nutrients could lead to billions of dollars for infrastructure improvements to meet more stringent requirements. other regions of the united states have implemented strategies costing $20-$50 billion that focus on conventional treatment. a comparable approach in the bay area would result in new costs of up to $7.5 billion unless a more tailored approach is developed utilizing advanced treatment strategies combined with an enhanced scientific program. water supply  the ongoing four year drought in california has caused extensive economic impacts including losses in landscaping commercial losses at water dependent businesses and agriculture. these will continue to mount as the drought continues through the summer and fall of 2015 and potentially future years. without additional sources of supply including recycled water the duration and severity of drought impacts will be more extensive. habitat impacts  marshland habitat around san francisco bay has greatly declined from historic levels due to multiple causes including development dredging and filling and sedimentation. continuing pressure will be exerted in coming years from projected sea level rise on the order of two to five feet by 2100. without additional restoration projects around the bay the existing wetlands could be degraded and the special status species that depend on them could face losses. these wetlands also serve as open space and recreational-education opportunities that are highly valued by bay area residents that need to be protected and enhanced. flood control impacts  numerous business homes and infrastructure are in the floodplain immediately adjacent to san francisco bay. a combination of aging flood protection infrastructure and rising sea level will continue to pose risks of flooding into the future without additional flood management improvement projects. ","1. resource stewardship. this project will reduce nutrient loading to san francisco bay at multiple locations and improve conditions over baseline conditions. approximately 5.4 million pounds per year of nitrogen will be removed from sf bay discharges (breakdown: zeolite-anammox 2.3m lbs optimization 2.0m lbs recycling 0.8m lbs hayward marsh 0.3m lbs). the proposed treatment sites and recycling facilities are shown on the project map. further the proposed monitoring improvements (moored sensors) will improve knowledge/data to better characterize nutrient effects and focus ongoing projects on those providing the greatest benefit. the hayward marsh restoration will enhance 145 acres of wetlands that are significant wildlife habitat migratory birds (forsters tern caspian tern black skimmer western snowy plover and california least tern) including three freshwater basins (85 acres) and two brackish basins (60 acres). approximately 2 million gallons per day (mgd) of wastewater will be used for this project and up to 20 mgd during wet weather. collectively the project facilities and actions will meaningfully contribute to ongoing efforts to protect and restore san francisco bay habitat. 2. water supply. the proposed recycling facilities will collectively produce up to 8800 acre feet of water per year after construction is completed. these supplies will be largely drought proof as they rely on wastewater streams as the source of supply. this will offset use of potable water to serve these same needs and lessen some of the need to import alternative sources from distant watersheds (e.g. delta). additionally discharges to sf bay including nutrients will be reduced. the final selections among the recommended projects will be made when the final grant solicitation is available from dwr. 3. flood management. the hayward marsh restoration effort will include improvements to flood control levees and help resist sedimentation. dredged material will be used to restore other wetland/marsh areas that may also aid flood control efforts. 4. infrastructure avoided cost. in addition to physical benefits this project has tremendous potential to offset billions of dollars in capital investment that would otherwise be required if a conventional approach to nutrient removal (i.e. nitrifation de-nitrication) is mandated in the future. the cost for infrastructure upgrades to reduce total nitrogen in discharged effluent from 30 mg/l (current level) to 2 mg/l (90% reduction level v) is estimated at a cost of $15 per gallon per day (falk et al 2011). if that unit cost were applied to all bay area discharges approximately 500 mgd the resulting upgrade cost would be $7.5 billion. if the reduction target was less restrictive than 90% such as 3 mg/l (level 4) then the estimate would be $3.0 billion; if 6 mg/l (level 3) then the cost would be $2.6 billion; if 12 mg/l (level 2) then the cost would be $1.7 billion. evaluating the different load reduction scenarios to identify the most cost efficient and environmentally effective approach requires further advancements in innovative treatment and well calibrated models which are both aided by the proposed project. if this project accounts for 5% of the justification to move from level v treatment costing $7.5 billion to level 4 costing $3.0 billion (e.g. it is one of several key steps for a full justification) the avoided cost benefit attributable to this project would be 5 percent of $4.5 billion or $225 million yielding a benefit/cost ratio for the entire project of more than 4.0. other scenarios (levels 2 or 3) would also have large avoided costs and a high benefit/cost ratio. the methodology can be fully documented. 5. emergency preparedness. the mobile advanced treatment units have the potential to be deployed to produce recycled water during an emergency. they could be set up to produce recycled water to serve industrial or irrigation needs at facilities located near a suitable wastewater source (pipe) during an emergency if potable water is unavailable. 6. energy recovery energy savings. the zeolite-anamoxx and advanced mobile treatment methods both use considerably less energy or can generate energy. the saf-mbr treatment process using anerobic digestion of dissolved organics is projected to generate 946 kwh/mg while conventional treatment consisting of enhanced primary treatment activated sludge and anaerobic digestion consumes 340 kwh/mg. this project method is expected to result in a positive net energy change which can be quantified. when cando treatment method is used to remove nitrogen from side streams of anaerobic disgesters net electrical energy consumed is expected to decrease to 300 kwh/mg a 34% decrease compared to conventional treatment. this project method is expected to result in a positive net energy change that can be quantified. for the zeolite-anammox system influent options include gravity flow that can significantly reduce energy costs. the system is designed to require minimal maintenance. see reference documents #2 and 3 for more detail. 7. reduced greenhouse gas emissions (ghg) emissions. the advanced mobile treatment and zeolite-anammox systems use less energy and will result in fewer ghg emissions. further the reduced amount of residual bio-solids after treatment will result in less truck trips for land application or burial. the amount of ghg emissions resulting from transport of biosolids is significant and can be calculated as: dry solids/yr x truck trips/dry metric tons x average distance/trip x ghg emissions/mile x % of dry solids land applied = total ghg emissions. values for bay area are: 153000 dmt/yr *29% land applied or buried* 1 truck/15 tons *30 mi ave/trip * 1.692kg co2e/mi = 150000 kg co2e /yr. the reduction attributable to this project can be quantified and the valuation calculated after dwr specifies the economic parameters to use across years. 8. reduced solids reduced fouling smaller footprint. the advanced mobile treatment processes (saf_mbr cando) will produce less solids as compared to conventional treatment (0.30 ton/mg and 0.37 ton/mg respectively as compared to 0.48 ton/mg for conventional). further less space is required because hydraulic residence time is reduced. the zeolite anammox system is well documented for producing very low sludge volumes and results in nitrogen gas and water as end products. regional impact - this project geographically spans san francisco bay san pablo bay and benefits the entire estuary and delta. the moored sensors portion of the project will significantly enhance monitoring capabilities in san francisco bay. the proposed facilities are distributed in each of the four sub-regions and each of the four functional areas are benefitted. collectively the project components will produce significant direct results and better focus future actions to address nutrient loading. regional priorities addressed by the project include: 1. climate change  this project will improve shoreline sustainability near the hayward marsh by reusing approximately 2 million gallons per day of wastewater from union sanitary district as a resource for wetlands enhancement at hayward marsh and by improving flood control levees. 2. regional water reliability / long-term sustainability  up to 8800 acre feet per year of recycled water will result from the project which is a sustainable supply not reliant on imports from distant watersheds. 3. health of the bay and creeks  reducing nutrient loading by roughy 5.4 million pounds per year and improving assessment capabilities will help restore bay processes and better focus future improvements on the most effective methods. 4. sediment management - flood control improvements at hayward marsh will include re-use of dredged sediment at other flood control projects in the region. collaboration - bacwa is a regional organization representing wastewater dischargers in all nine bay area counties. the partners involved with implementation include the san francisco estuary institute renuwit stanford university union sanitary district and several other sanitation districts that will be making site improvements. supporters of this project include the interagency ecological program u.s. geological survey bay keeper delta science center state and federal water contractors water science center. the bacwa recycled water committee will continue to facilitate regional meetings to help arrive at final recycling grant facility selections. scalability - this project is scalable and some of the facilities and actions would be reduced or reprioritized if there is a need to scale back the grant request with some reduction in benefits.

"muir beach water conservation implementation "," ","marin ","37.8622 n | -122.5814 w ","2/1/16 ","12/31/18 ","the community of muir beach along state route 1 in southern marin county. ","muir beach drinking water demand will be decreased because the project proposal will include conservation implementation measures of graywater reuse and rainwater catchment. higher water flows improve dissolved oxygen and keep water temperatures down for wildlife and the entire ecosystem. additional water tank storage will also enhance fire fighting capability and public safety where tens of thousands of visitors to the beaches and muir woods could be isolated in a fire or other emergency situation. groundwater storage will improve because the drawn down by the community will be lessened with water savings totaling around 24 acre feet per year projected. redwood creek in marin muir beach water quality will benefit from having more consistent seasonal flows because of less pumping of ground water. those flows will protect federally endangered coho salmon by consistently raising of the water table and groundwater storage. that will enable restoration to successfully move forward. habitat for all aquatic endangered and threatened species throughout the lower redwood creek will be immediately improved by conservation efforts outlined by state and federal agencies. infiltration of groundwater will increase the sponge of the flood plain and slow release to improve summer and fall water cfs flows. improvements to habitat increases resiliency within the system for wildlife and humans. ","the project will address the indirect draw down of water in redwood creek by the muir beach community and pelican inn. it will 1. reverse the loss of water supply in redwood creek for highly endangered coho salmon (of three year classes: 1 year class extirpated 1 year class removed to a hatchery 1 year class had only 4 nests). low levels prevented outmigration and overall fish viability in the drought. restoration of the muir beach wetlands for coho steelhead and red-legged frogs would be supported by the project and improve water quality for coho salmon survival. 2. enhance water supply for the community and thousands of tourists in an emergency and where the creek and aquifer is the only supply. federal and state recommendations include alternative water storage for fire fighting or another emergency that could be obtained by increasing storage. in an emergency the community has only about 5 days of water stored. 3. build resilience into a vulnerable system for fish and people and where should the pumps fail there are approximately five days of supply at the current water usage. rainwater storage would offset this part of the year and allow the tank to remain filled longer. we are proposing retrofit of qualifying homes and businesses for graywater systems to an average of $2500 per household= $377500. that would include re-plumbing diverters irrigation augmentation with graywater piping. the proposal includes the installation of rainwater catchment tanks. (varying sizes to landscape size/type and capacity) to an average of $4200 = $634200 per 150 homes and 1 business and provides installation of 2 electric low water composting toilets in the community center (legal in marin county) $15000 at $7500. two surveys and two education seminars would be conducted including: 4 community meetings held with the csd to roll out plans and begin project. approximate administrative and survey costs: $12300. to include outreach management assessment and providing recommended certified installers for project. conduct surveys project monitoring and provide educational materials for a comprehensive community water conservation plan and infrastructure that will benefit the community the coho salmon and steelhead. total projected savings of water with rainwater catchment and graywater systems we could save 12400 gallons per day (pop. 310 - average person uses 40 gallons per day for bathing dishes and laundry ) - or 4526000 gallons or 13.90 acre feet per year. this grant will enable the community to protect redwood creek and reliant species during this and future droughts while securing water for basic human needs and landscaping while protecting property values. 151 roofs times 1000 square feet = 623 gallons per inch =94100 gallons per inch community and x 35 average inches per year 3.3 million gallons or 10.13 acre feet. together the savings of 13.90 acre feet plus 10.13 acre feet would equal 24 acre feet per year of water savings and water left in the hydrologic system of groundwater and the stream. this is an optimistic scenario based on capturing and using all rainwater and dependent on the resident's use and plumbing. rainwater catchment may not have that potential and is dependent on containment size and frequency of storms and use.

","the project would benefit the landowners residents the coho salmon and steelhead trout. water quality temperature and supply would be improved. groundwater recharge would be enhanced and because of the flood plain connection to the stream the flows of lower redwood creek would improve significantly. potentially 14-24 acre feet of water could be left in the system accessible to fish if the project is realized. the project could prevent the extirpation of coho salmon steelhead tidewater goby and red-legged frogs all federally and state listed special status species. awareness of water use and habitat impacts by landowners would be increased. watershed stewardship would be enhanced through presentations and conscious use of water. the project would enhance resiliency during climate change the drought and in the event of an emergency such as fire or earthquake. landowners would be able to continue to maintain healthy gardens and that would lessen the fire danger.

","not implementing this proposal will further substantiate the challenges identified by local agencies in 2013 bay area irwm plan related to regulatory compliance and financial and funding challenges. local agencies including sunnyvale will continue to struggle with how to meet increasing stormwater requirements specifically related to green infrastructure planning and implementation and agencies will continue to grapple with green infrastructure implementation with a lack of information and understanding of the costs associated with these types of projects. additionally the long term water quality benefits provided by the bioretention areas designed to treat street runoff and remove sediment and other pollutants of concern will not be realized. ","water quality benefits: it is commonly known that public streets in the bay area contribute polluted stormwater runoff to local waterways and in turn to san francisco bay. the epas protecting water quality from urban runoff identifies primary urban runoff pollutants as sediment sediment-bound pollutants such as heavy metals pcbs and pesticides and hydrocarbons and oil and grease from motor vehicles. these pollutants can harm fish and wildlife kill native vegetation and adversely impact recreational areas. through the construction of approximately 11620 square feet of bioretention areas the project will improve water quality by providing for landscape based treatment and pollutant removal of untreated road runoff prior to flowing to the bay. stormwater and flood management benefits: through the construction of bioretention areas the project will reduce the quantity of stormwater flowing to the bay. by design bioretention features capture and retain stormwater and promote infiltration. underdrains are included to facilitate release of treated stormwater when retention capacity is exceeded. resource stewardship benefits: this project creates a visible access point to the bay trail that intersperses rain garden treatment areas with public parking for bay trail users. relocating the parking area from a hidden location next to sunnyvales water pollution control plant can increase awareness of the bay trail among area employees and visitors increase bay trail use and increase watershed and bay stewardship. interpretive signage will be placed at key locations highlighting the benefits of the rain gardens educating visitors about the connection between the urban landscape and the bay and the importance of bay protection actions.

","existing wetland areas would be enhanced by excavating new channels to connect them to the bay and allow tidal flooding. material removed from wetland areas would be used to build upland areas with gentle slopes and to create broad transitional zone habitat. the transitional zone would become a future tidal marsh as sea level rises in line with predictions. the goal is to provide long-term self-sustaining tidal wetlands seasonal wetlands and coastal prairie to create valuable habitat for special status species and for public access for compatible passive recreation and public education. restoration and enhancement of breuner marsh will increase natural habitat values of the site for marine intertidal and upland species. restoration and enhancement at breuner marsh will focus on developing self-sustaining ecological habitats with a minimal amount of long-term human intervention. public access will focus on developing recreational facilities that are compatible with restored habitats and that require a minimum level of maintenance. restoration of this former marsh allows for expansion of subtidal-to-wetland-to-upland transitional areas that are present at only a few east bay locations. this property provides an especially important opportunity to maintain viable habitats in the face of anticipated sea level rise. enhancing existing seasonal wetlands and creating new seasonal wetlands will provide greater connectivity with other habitats. enhancement and creation of new coastal prairie and upland buffer will increase the value of transitional areas between ecological habitats. benefits of these restoration efforts include establishing protected cover and shorebird foraging areas as well as roosting nesting and brooding sites. special status species that will benefit from this project include salt marsh harvest mouse california clapper rail and california black rail all of which are present in the project area. creating restoring and enhancing tidal marsh and seasonal wetlands at breuner marsh will greatly improve ecological conditions for wetland dependent species at this location on san pablo bay. improved habitat for small mammals and birds such as salt marsh harvest mouse california clapper rail and california black rail will aid in the recovery of these species. re-establishing a wetland corridor between wildcat/san pablo creek marshes and breuner/giant marsh will link these existing habitat areas increase wetland acreage and reduce isolation of plant and animal populations. ","the shallow zone groundwater was considered as a possible source for irrigation water but the ph levels and salinity make it very marginal to unusable. the deeper aquifer is considerably more saline with tds levels reported to be in the range of 4100 milligrams per liter (mg/l) to as much as 9400 mg/l. the state water resources control board considers that water with tds levels exceeding 3000 mg/l are not reasonably expected to be a public water supply (swrcb resolution 88-63). based on ph levels and salinity neither aquifer is considered to be a source of drinking water or irrigation water supply. much of richmond's historic shoreline has been lost to industrial uses and is a point source of pollution in the bay. marshes have been filled fragmented polluted and invaded by non-native species. however the seven-mile stretch of shoreline from point san pablo to point pinole represents one of the last remaining shorelines still largely intact. the goal of this wetland restoration project is to provide long-term self-sustaining tidal wetlands seasonal wetlands and coastal prairie that will provide and enhance valuable habitat. wetlands restoration will aid in reducing polluted run-off from surrounding urban industrial areas by providing a natural filtering system of marshland vegetation. due to the combination of wetlands and upland areas the project will provide a transitional area to mitigate the effects of extreme high-tide events caused by sea level rise due to climate change. the high-tide marsh zone once kilometers deep is now an interrupted band averaging approximately 2 meters deep due to diking fill and urban development. extreme high tide events exacerbated by increased numbers of severe storms and expected sea level rise due to climate change cause catastrophic flooding of marshes. the restoration plan will focus on establishing proper elevations and soil balance through a grading plan. the approach will not attempt to engineer a pre-determined tidal marsh but will provide a setting for the natural evolution of wetland functions (including sea-level rise) and interplay of natural ecologic processes to restore the preexisting marsh. the goal is to provide long-term self-sustaining tidal wetlands seasonal wetlands and coastal prairie to create valuable habitat for special status species and for public access for compatible passive recreation and public education. restoration and enhancement of breuner marsh will increase natural habitat values of the site for marine intertidal and upland species. it provides water resource related recreational opportunities to lower income residents in richmond. it is adjacent to the high density underserved neighborhoods of parchester village bayview-montalvin tara hills rollingwood and the iron triangle in richmond.

","san pablo bay and the greater san francisco bay has lost about 90 percent of its historic tidal marsh habitat due to farming and development. this project would restore over 1500 acres of tidal wetland and mudflat habitat which will benefit a wide array of bird and fish species including several that are threatened and endangered. the project would also restore up to 400 acres of seasonal wetlands and provide flood protection for 700 homes. the project will beneficially reuse waste-water. the novato sanitary district (nsd) discharges an average of 10.3 million gallons per day of treated effluent into san pablo bay. the discharge only occurs in the wet season due to concerns over a lack of dilution at the outfall; in the dry season the effluent is discharged on to fields leased to the district by the county of marin. this project would use the effluent to restore fresh and brackish water habitat within the newly constructed marsh complex. one outcome of this project is that the spray fields (currently used to dispose of summer flows) could be rendered obsolete thereby freeing up the fields for other uses. nsd is currently working on recycling of waste-water including a regional system (north bay water reuse authority); however it is unlikely that in the short and medium term there will be a substantial reuse of wet weather flows due to infrastructure and storage constraints. reuse of waste-water at the subject restoration project provides a reuse option that is immediate and which does not preclude regional recycling in the future. the project will restore tidal wetlands by recycling dredged sediment that would otherwise be disposed of in the bay and ocean. the project uses the dredged sediment as fill. the bmk property like the adjacent hamilton airfield is a subsided former baylands and across the site the current ground elevations range from five to six feet below mean sea level. in order to accelerate marsh development the site will be filled with dredged sediment using a suction dredge and hydraulic slurry. sediment is delivered by barge from dredging projects throughout the bay area. only sediment that has been tested and approved for restoration purposes will be placed onsite. the material is transferred from barges to the site as a slurry (hydraulic placement) which is far more efficient than mechanical placement and also recreates the gradual gradients found in nature. the project benefits the ecosystems of san francisco bay and the deep ocean because it makes use of dredged sediment to re-construct wetlands which would otherwise be disposed of into the water column with numerous impacts (at designated dump sites). the project will protect a residential development from flooding in that the wetland design incorporates a new flood management levee. the levee takes the place of the existing 3.3- mile long levee that runs along the perimeter of the site. the existing levee was constructed by farming interests in the 1880s and is protected from erosion by a mixture of rip-rap and fringing salt marsh. the existing levee has had minor failures in the last decade necessitating spot repairs totaling a half of a linear mile. the new 1.7-mile long levee will be constructed to a higher elevation than the existing levee will be engineered and protected from wave erosion by the newly constructed salt marsh. ","the state of california (coastal conservancy) will continue to incur expenses of levee upkeep and property management in order to protect the bel marin keys community from flooding. the effluent from the novato sanitary district will continue to be discharged into san pablo bay with no added benefit to the environment. the state's investment in the bel marin keys property (over $16 million) for fish and wildlife habitat enhancement and protection will not be realized. endangered and other listed bird and fish species in san pablo bay will continue to struggle to recover a viable population due to a lack of suitable habitat. novato's waste-water which is treated to a high standard will continue to be discharged into the bay in the wet season with no added benefit to the environment. ",": project will restore over 1500 acres of tidal wetlands which will improve the water quality of san pablo bay (beneficial uses). also see section iv below. the project would also beneficially use treated waste-water from the novato sanitary district changing discharge from a wet-season bay discharge to a year-around recycling to restore fresh / brackish marsh on site. the project purpose is not flood and stormwater management however the wetland design incorporates a new flood management levee that will help protect the bel marin keys residential community from flooding. the existing perimeter levee that runs some 3 linear miles along novato creek and san pablo bay will be replaced by a 1.7 mile long engineered levee that will bisect the site dividing it between tidal and seasonal wetlands. currently the 700-home bel marin community is protected from san pablo bay tides by the existing perimeter levee and storage on the site. the new levee will be built to a higher elevation and will be better protected from erosion than the existing levee system. restoring the bmkv expansion site would result in approximately 1785 acres of tidal wetlands seasonal and upland habitat for fish and wildlife. special status species that may benefit from the restoration of bmk include salmonids salt marsh harvest mouse california clapper rail double-crested cormorant california brown

world. they flourish when the rate of sediment accumulation is equal to or greater than the rate of land subsidence and where there is adequate protection from large waves and storms. wetlands are areas of high nutrient and biological productivity that provide the detrital products that constitute the base of the food chain. sediment and epiphytic algae are often important components of the autotrophic community. heterotrophic communities are often dominated by the detrital food chain of tidal wetlands providing foraging habitat for several threatened and endangered species. in addition tidal marshes are out-welling systems that export organic matter to adjacent estuaries. tidal marshes provide direct prey resources to several aquatic and terrestrial organisms including listed juvenile salmonids. because they are generally rich in invertebrate organisms tidal wetlands and mudflats that would be created as part of the bmkv restoration project could provide high-value foraging habitat for juvenile salmonids shallow tidal wetlands and salt-tolerant vegetation (grasses and rushes) can provide refugia from predators. some studies suggest that juvenile salmonids that rear in wetland areas growlarger and therefore may be less prone to predation when they enter the marineenvironment. restored tidal wetlands may also directly benefit other species including starry flounder and english sole which are known to use tidal wetlands for rearing and sacramento splittail which may use wetland habitat for spawning and rearing. tidal wetlands may also indirectly benefit several protected species that do not directly use tidal wetland habitat (e.g. efh-managed species that inhabit san pablo bay). export of organic detritus from tidal wetlands can increase primary productivity in adjacent estuaries. detritus that flows to the estuarine waters can sustain prey species for several aquatic organisms and help support secondary production especially in estuaries where plankton primary production is depressed. studies suggest that organic detritus either filtered from the water or ingested from the sediment is an important alternate source of energy for aquatic organisms especially when plankton concentrations are low. tidal wetlands can act as a buffer against the effects of sea level rise by stabilizing shorelines and creating a buffer against erosion. tidal wetlands can also sequester carbon and thereby help offset the emission of green house gases. creation of wetland habitat through implementation of the project would have direct benefits to fisheries and the ecological health of through implementation of the project would have direct benefits to fisheries and the ecological health of sf bay and adjoining ocean by significantly reducing if not completely eliminating dredged material placement in the ocean and bay while bmk is being filled. there will also be benefits to benthic communities located at and near alcatraz the other two in-bay sites and the deep-ocean water column that result from the diversion of dredged material to the atf and hence to the bmk. once the bmk is returned to tidal action bay

","this project will preserve and enhance in-stream and adjacent marshland habitat while maintaining or improving the design level of flood protection. it also provides a direct water quality improvement by expanding constructed wetlands providing stormwater treatment benefits. ","the walnut creek watershed is the largest in contra costa county draining over 150 square miles and containing eight cities and over 300000 residents. the lowest or most downstream portion of this watershed is called lower walnut creek and it consists of a wide trapezoidal earth channel with levees on one or both sides. it is populated with a diverse assortment of wildlife both in the water and in the adjacent marshlands. the channel is heavily impacted by sediment and has partially silted up which affects its flood carrying capacity. but removing the sediment also removes the habitat and wildlife and the sediment would quickly return. in essence the project is transforming this legacy facility into a a sustainable channel that provides critical flood protection in a way that is more compatible with the plants and animals that call the creek home. this can be accomplished by: creating additional wetlands riparian habitat and revegetation potentialmoving back the channel levees in the lower reaches to provide additional capacity for floodwatersreducing de-silting costs and finding reuse sites for excess sediment from the project. restoring the design level of flood protection by expanding conveyance and securing flowage easements over low risk parcels currently protected by the levees. other objectives include expanding recreation and educational opportunities along the creek. this project was built by the corps in the 1960s and has been problematic since it was constructed. in 2003 after decades of wrangling with the corps the flood control district partnered with the corps on a general reevaluation project. this produced excellent technical data (such as sediment studies hydraulic model wetland delineation and salmonid viability studies) but when congress eliminated earmark funding the project stalled. in response the flood control district took the unusual step to request congress deauthorize the lowest 4 miles of the 22 mile walnut creek system. this request was granted in the 2014 wrrda legislation and now in local control planning can begin in earnest. the flood control district retained environmental science associates (esa) to lead the local planning effort. this effort in well underway with technical analyses and comprehensive stakeholder engagement proceeding simultaneously. the likely preferred alternative will consist of breaching or lowering approximately 3 miles of project levees to restore flood flows to wetland areas. this would augment habitat allow accumulated sediment (and habitat) to remain in the channel and would restore the design level of flood protection. lower walnut creek is proud to be one of the demonstration projects included in the \"flood control 2.0\" program being let by sfei. ","overview: lower walnut creek today looks significantly different than when it was channelized over 60 years ago. even back in 1963 when the corps began its efforts in the watershed lower walnut creek was far from pristine and untouched. development: when farms and fields are developed into commercial residential and industrial uses areas where water used to drain into the soil became paved over. this new impervious surface meant that less water soaked into the ground and more ran off into creeks. natural processes had formed the creeks to a certain size and this additional runoff meant the creeks flooded more often. to make matters worse some of the most desirable flat lands for farming and development were near the creek in its historic floodplain. the high value of this land set up tremendous pressures to reduce flood damages and tame the creek. channelization: historic aerial photos from 1939 show the alignment of walnut creek to be significantly different from when the corps began work in 1963. in the 1940s and 1950s the natural creek was channelized by neighboring landowners to help keep stormwater in the creek and to pass it through the system efficiently. when the corps was asked to help the situation in the 1960s the resulting project further widened the already channelized creek and constructed levees to allow the water to rise higher without escaping. the newly-formed flood control district (district) was the non-federal sponsor for this work by the corps of engineers and signed agreements saying they would own and maintain the channel in perpetuity. calculations at the time showed the channel would need minimal maintenance and sufficient funds were available to perform this maintenance. sediment: soon after lower walnut creek was handed over to the flood control district for maintenance it became clear that much more sediment was depositing in the creek than was originally calculated by the corps. the corps returned in 1973 and participated in dredging the lower channel removing over 850000 cubic yards of sand and mud. when the district prepared to dredge the channel again in the early 1990s it because clear that significant habitat for wildlife had formed in the channel since the last invasive dredge and getting regulatory permits necessary to do this work would prove difficult and enormously costly. this difficulty was compounded by the reduction in the districts property tax funds as a result of the passage of prop 13 in 1978. unfortunately leaving the habitat in place was not an acceptable maintenance practice in the eyes of the corps of engineers . this conflict put the district in a no-win situation: should the district remove all the vegetation and habitat in the channel to restore it to its 1960s configuration? should the district allow the sediment vegetation and habitat to remain but be out of conformance with the corps maintenance requirements? the district ultimately chose a third option which was to deauthorize the project from the federal system and proceed with a local project without the corps oversight or assistance. ","if the project is not implemented opportunities for the habitat improvement would be lost and continued sediment accumulation would reduce flood carrying capacity. this would eventually lead to increased flood risk for neighboring property owners and for after a flood increased demands to \"clean out that creek!\" instead the district's project provides a sustainable balance between flood protection and habitat improvement that makes the creek work better for all. ","currently the habitat present in the stream help to slow and filter stormwater improving water quality. the lower walnut creek channel is the primary drain for 150 square miles and 300000 residents. it serves an extremely critical role in the drainage protection of large commercial industrial and residential areas. a fundamental component of the lower walnut creek restoration is the preservation of the habitat that has developed in the channel and to implement a project that would allow this habitat to remain. a very exciting part of the project is the recreational opportunities afforded by this project. implementing lower walnut creek paves the way for a long awaited ebrpd iron horse trail extension which would add the northen-most six miles to make the new terminus at the shore of suisun bay at the mouth of walnut creek. it also would intersect with the great delta trail and support the new staging area and interpretative experience at pacheco marsh.

","the bay area creek mouth assessment tool will facilitate identification and implementation of habitat restoration and flood protection projects. habitat protection and restoration: creek mouths are at the interface of fluvial and tidal processes which will be heavily impacted by climate change. protection and restoration of these creek mouth habitats will not only preserve or enhance current conditions but also provide support for bay-wide effects of climate change. strategically selected creek mouths for restoration and/or preservation is the first barrier against sea level rise and the resulting flooding events. flood protection: tidal marshes and adjacent riparian habitats are natural means to slow and retain flood water buffer storm surges and thus add protection from flooding to the surrounding low-lying land. ","the interface between tributaries and the bay is one of the most ecologically important components of the bay system. historically these were the bay's natural deltas; places of high ecological diversity and complexity. then as now they were critically important as reliable rearing habitat for juvenile steelhead. these locations play a disproportionately important role in the sustenance of the bay's tidal marshlands as the delivery points for watershed carbon and sediment. in addition these areas are critical for flood management and face increasingly high flood risk because of climate change and the predicted increases in storm intensity tidal surge and sea level. restoring creek mouths to enhance or increase historical tidal and fluvial functions can increase critical habitat for birds wildlife and aquatic organisms and can while also reducing flood risk both along the shoreline and farther upstream. in 2012 the san francisco estuary partnership and the san francisco estuary institute undertook a comprehensive regional inventory and assessment of creek mouths around the bay. once complete (in 2013) this inventory and assessment will advance the bay area's ability to better integrate riparian tidal and subtidal restoration efforts for multiple benefits including increasing ecological value and reducing human health and hazard risks from flooding. building on the completed inventory the bay area creek mouth assessment tool would provide an online interactive public interface for accessing the narrative and geospatial data collected for creeks around the san francisco bay. providing access to the data in a user-friendly online interface allows agencies organizations and others in the bay area to better understand the regional opportunities for creek mouth restoration and prioritize limited funding. furthermore providing important data on the present and historical ecology hydrology and land use in and adjacent to the creek mouths will support and advance ongoing and proposed restoration and flood protection projects. the bay area creek mouth assessment tool would provide access to both regional and local scale data on creek mouths. at a the regional scale (the bay area) the tool would include data on: - physical characteristics of the creek mouth: length width physical barriers - presence of invasive plants (spartina) - presence (historic or current) of steelhead - local interested parties (friends of groups etc.) - contamination history - public/private land ownership profile at the local creek mouth scale the tool would deploy precise geospatial layers including: - adjacent restoration project boundaries - public/private land boundaries - public land ownership - levees - historical ecology data the bay area creek mouth assessment tool project would where feasible and appropriate integrate with other user tools such as sfeis ecoatlas the san francisco bay joint venture tracker and the conservation lands network. the tool will not duplicate other efforts but will offer unique functionality. opportunities to collaborate with regional and local partners to share data and develop compatible user interfaces will be pursued and a strategy for collaborative and integrated data collection and management will be included in the project. ","agencies and organizations charged with identifying and implementing critical flood protection and habitat restoration projects do not currently have access to data that allows an analysis of opportunities and constraints in the critical fluvial/tidal interface areas. this project solves the need to provide this important information in an easy to use interface to state and regional agencies local governments and special districts nonprofit organizations and the others interested in understanding the restoration opportunities and constraints for bay area creek mouths. without an opportunity to develop the online tool the extensive data already collected may not be available to all those who would benefit. furthermore if the tool is not created fewer critical multi-benefit flood protection and habitat restoration projects will be implemented as the data to support such projects will not be readily available. ","creek mouths are transition zones where the defined channel meets the open water pelagic zone of the estuary thus creating a unique ecotone. as sea levels rise the creek mouths become vulnerable to increased flooding impacting low lying communities drowning of marshland and an upstream migration of head of tide causing flooding upstream. prioritizing restoration opportunities is a fundamental step to increasing the resilience of the bay shoreline minimizing future flooding impacts and planning for the long term health of the bays marshes creeks and communities. ","one of the many ecosystem services that marshes provide is filtering runoff from the upstream creeks and urban areas thus cleaning water before it runs into the bay. the tool will lead to additional creek mouth restoration projects that will improve water quality of the bay. prioritizing creek mouth restoration of marshes can have multiple benefits and impact decisions made by flood control districts stormwater managers and resource conservation districts. -protection from tidal flooding -filtering and buffering of fluvial flooding -stormwater wetlands to detain water through an augmentation of restoration projects in the fluvial/tidal interface areas the bay area creek mouth assessment tool will enhance flood and stormwater management. this project would provide guidance for strategic resource stewardship by prioritizing restoration using metrics such as presence of endangered species public land and public access and presence of a watershed stewardship group. this project also fits into the goals of several resource agencies and non-profits working on bayland restoration and sea level rise. by creating a regional and public data center efforts of data collection can be streamlined. -enhance ecosystem services or beneficial uses ","san francisco estuary partnership ","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1"

"redwood creek restoration at muir beach phase 5 ","the overall project will restore the lost natural function of lower redwood creek its estuary tidal lagoon adjacent floodplain and associated wetland and dune habitats over a 46-acre area. lower redwood creek has been degraded by a century of landscape modifications and suffers from a lack of connectivity with its floodplain severe channel aggradation and loss of habitat for federally listed coho and steelhead. phase 5 or the last phase of the project is proposed for irwmp which entails relocating the last 1000 lf of the channel to its natural location when marin county constructs a new vehicular bridge over the creek and its floodplain. the project is a partnership between the national park service marin county dept. of public works and the non-profit golden gate national parks conservancy. ","marin ","37.52 | -122.35 ","02/01/2014 ","01/30/2019 ","big lagoon muir beach marin county the project area is bounded by hwy 1 on the easterly side the pacific ocean on the westerly side coastal hills to the south and hillslopes occupied by residents of muir beach to the north. ","the project provides stormwater improvements because it restores floodplain function at the same time that it reduces water surface elevation of floods. it provides groundwater benefits because it removes items that disconnect groundwater from the channel (such as the levee road). the project also includes a small feasibility assessment to look at ways to increase groundwater storage in the middle area of the redwood creek watershed. the project improves habitat protection and restoration by providing extensive new winter habitat for coho and steelhead as well as 3 new ponds for california red-legged frog breeding. the project provides flood protection by eliminating a current problem in which pacific way is impassable for residents and visitors during average and moderate flood events. the project has already established a relationship with native americans particularly the federated indians of graton rancheria. since the site has multiple archeological sites plant species were used which correspond to the ethnographic record and were used historically by tribes. the tribe is currently in talks to develop a demonstration project to collect plants on the site for ethnographic uses. the tribe conducts an annual salmon blessing at a public event each year and participates in cultural resource monitoring. ","the overall project restores the natural function to the creek floodplain wetlands and dunes in the 46-acre area at the mouth of the redwood creek. the restoration is accomplished by removing features constructed in the 20th century which confine the creek segregate it from its floodplain constrict flows and obstruct sediment transport. specifically a 1300 levee road across the center of the floodplain will be removed a 500-lf visitor parking lot extending into the floodplain as a \"dam\" to restore the floodplain and the undersized 25-foot-long pacific way bridge a county vehicular bridge will be replaced with a 250-lf vehicular bridge across the creek and its newly connected floodplain. along with these primary actions numerous details are incorporated to provide enhanced winter habitat for federally and state endangered coho such as an off-channel pond backwaters and both large and small woody debris. about 240000 people visit the site each year so the modified visitor amenities must allow access while fully accommodating natural processes. a new 450-foot pedestrian bridge with long spans between piers will extend across the restored floodplain from the reconfigured floodplain. a new emergency access road was upgraded around the perimeter of the site with rock drain lenses to allow natural drainage patterns and a trail was rerouted in a subdrainage to better connect the micro-drainage with the creek and floodplain. when the natural processes function the flood elevations during average and moderate winter events are lower thereby reducing the threat to adjacent private property as well as access on the county road pacific way. the project is being implemented in 5 phases. irwmp funding is requested for phase 5 the last phase of the project. this entails the 1000 lf of channel realignment to its natural location that must be conducted at the same time that marin county dept. of public works constructs its new 250-lf vehicular bridge. the bridge cannot be constructed without constructing the new channel alignment under it at the same time. this request does not include a request for the bridge since marin county is seeking other transportation-related funds for that purpose. this request is focused on the channel construction which will restore a alignment in the creek's natural topographic location and fully connect the creek with its floodplain both laterally and longitudinally. this phase of work also entails relocation of an at&t utility box excavation of natural gravel from the old creek bed and abandonment of the old channel. about 12000 cy of material will be moved for this work. the phase 5 channel would be the upstream-most channel restoration in the project with its most upstream point at about 3200 lf upstream of the confluence with the ocean. phases 1 through 3 of the project were completed from 2009 to 2011 and included realignment and restoration of the channel and new backwaters along the lower 2200 lf of the project area. the levee road was removed and a portion of the parking lot was removed and replaced with the first half of a 450-lf pedestrian bridge over the floodplain. phase 4 is expected to be constructed in 2013 and will consist of reconfiguring the visitor parking lot to expand the full floodplain. the second leg of the new pedestrian bridge (an additional 225 lf) will also be constructed in phase 4. since the new channel and floodplain processes directly benefit coho salmon and since the coho population in redwood creek is the southern-most viable population of coho this project meets regional priorities identified by the national marine fisheries service and the california dept. of fish and game to enhance habitat for the california central coast evoluntionarily significant unit. ","the relocation of 1000 lf of channel in the upstream reach of the project area and under the new vehicular bridge is important for the following reasons: the action fulfills the overall project goal to remove constraints to natural creek and floodplain processes. the existing 25-foot-long pacific way bridge is substantially undersized and causes flows and sediment transport to be obstructed. flood flows therefore jump to the creek bank in average events that would otherwise be contained within the channel. the road therefore floods more frequently than it otherwise would and the likelihood of successful passage for fish on the floodplain - which is disconnected from the creek by the levee road - is doubtful. the creek in its existing location is geomorphologically unstable. it was historically located in the area proposed for its relocation. it has been held in place by prior management actions but it will always be trying to jump to the proposed restoration location. however without the new bridge that will never be possible. the full answer is to relocate the channel to its natural location and construct a bridge that will allow both routine and overbank flows to pass. the phase 5 action for both the creek relocation combined with the partnership action to build the bridge is necessary to achieve the reduced flood elevations on adjacent private property and on the roadway during average and moderate winter events. ","high flows will be choked by the undersized pacific way bridge. sediment transport will be obstructed causing the upstream channel to fill more rapidly with sediment and reducing its conveyance capacity. winter habitat for coho and steelhead in that reach of the creek will continue to have dysfunctional connections between the creek and floodplain. management actions at the county bridge are likely to be needed. residents of muir beach will continue to have periods during average and moderate winter of events where the road to their homes is unpassable. the downstream reaches of the channel restored in phases 1 to 3 in 2009 to 2011 already provide significant flow and habitat benefits but they were designed and constructed for the long term downstream with the added conveyance capacity of the restored upstream reach. the area restored in the lower 2200 lf is subject to a function related to flows and sediment transport that is different than designed if the upper reach is not constructed. ","the project removes the constraints to natural groundwater dynamics with the channel and associated off-channel ponds and backwaters. a levee across the floodplain is removed and the channel is located at a natural location in the floodplain. groundwater recharge will function naturally. an extensive network of groundwater wells has been installed at the site to document exactly how groundwater elevations function in relation to creek water surface elevations. models projected that groundwater elevations would drop about 1 foot when the confining features (eg: the levee road and parking lot) were removed; data being collected is testing that theory. however please note that even a possible decline in groundwater elevations was considered for new plant communities. in many areas a surface layer of fill has been removed creating wetlands with better groundwater connection for native plants. a very minor component of the overall project includes a feasibility analysis to identify ways to increase groundwater storage about a mile upstream of the project area (in franks valley). the purpose of increased groundwater storage is to protect instream flows to benefit summer habitat for coho and steelhead. we would look at ways that drainages from the hillslopes could direct water to wetlands in the floodplain instead of draining directly into the channel in winter events. water quality benefits of this project pertain primarily to turbidity and sediment loading. the project will allow more natural sediment transport dynamics as well as more natural areas for deposition on the floodplain which may benefit salmonids. by removing the constraints to floodflows and reconnecting the floodplain hydraulic models have shown up to a 1 foot decrease in water surface elevations of overbank flows in the vicinity of private residences and a local private business near the new creek reach proposed for phase 5 funding. in addition the local road pacific way would never be flooded since the bridge would span the 100-year event; therefore residents and visitors would never be stranded due to flooding on the road. in the pre-restoration condition stranding occurred on average about once per year due to flooding on the road. this project entails extensive resource stewardship management for volunteers and participation by school groups conservation groups neighborhood groups and others. so far we have clocked about 3000 hours of volunteer participation each year in this project. we grow about 30000 native plants each year in a watershed nursery. one nursery manager works with volunteers and interns throughout the year to collect these propagules of riparian and wetland species and grow them. a stewardship coordinator then manages volunteer work groups one to two times per week - or sometimes more - to plants these. additional stewardship activities include detailed work to create suitable cover for coho while the riparian vegetation becomes reestablished and removing non-native weeds.

","if the proposed project is not implemented the ebrwp will not be oprated at the design capacity while wasting the limited drinking water. benefits such as increasing regional reliance and flood control reducing drinking water supply restoring wetlands may not be fully realized while limtied drinking supply continued to be used for non-potable uses. ","the funding will cover a portion of one of ebmud's integratate recycled water management project (irwmp) components. the irwmp will enhance ebmud's ability to meet the needs of its 1.34 million business and residential customers by providing a reliable alternative recycled water supply that will conserve high quality potable water supplies. the projects that comprise the irwmp will supply up to 8 mgd of highly purified recycled water to portions of ebmud's extensive service area except the san ramon valley whis is already served by a recycled water porject which benefits from some federal funding. this project will help to offset demands for potable water by substituting recycled water for beneficial landscape commercial and industrial water uses currently served by ebmud's supplies from the mokelumne reiver which is a tributary to the delta. during dry and critically dry years the project will reduce ebmud deversions from the mokelumne and/or sacramento rivers. by increasing the proportion of recycled water used ebmud will be able to save a larger percentage of its high quality potable water supplies for residential and commercial potable uses thereby increasing regional supply reliability. the project reduces wastewater discharges to san francisco bay by resuding wastewater that would otherwise be discharged to the san francisco bay from ebmud's main wastewater treatment plant. the project will reduce the amount of water that must otherwise by delivered from the mokelumne river to ebmud's service area. reducing deliveries can result in higher reservoir storage levels in ebmud reservoirs in the sierra nevada foothills and increased reservoir releases to the lower mokelumne river. once that water reaches the delta it provides additional benefits for delta resources and water users.

","santa clara "," ","tbd ","tbd "," ","the project improves water quality and reduces flooding by constructing lid- based drainage improvements in alleys that are surfaced with deteriorating pavement and in places are unpaved and generate substantial dust and sediment. since each of the alleys lack drainage infrastructure water floods them and adjacent yards and garages during storms. the project will resurface the alleys with permeable pavement and pavers that will drain to below-grade infiltration galleries. the project benefits a disadvantaged community since it is located within the larger spartan-keyes strong neighborhood initiative area (sni). the san jos city council adopted the strong neighborhoods initiative (sni) redevelopment plan with the purpose of providing for the rehabilitation and redevelopment of blighted areas within the san jose redevelopment project area. the project site is located in a census tract with a median household income (2009 american community survey) of $35427 which is less than 59% of the state median household income ($60392). according to the spartan-keyes neighborhood improvement plan amendment (december 2008) the condition of alleyways in the spartan keyes sni area has been an ongoing concern of residents. ","the san jos green alley demonstration project will create durable cost-effective low impact development drainage improvements in up to nine alleys in a disadvantaged community to demonstrate how lid strategies work in a retrofit project context. the subject alleys are spread throughout an older neighborhood of san jos where adjacent properties that lack bmps drain to the alleys and buildings flanking the alleys prevent the use of surface stormwater treatment facilities. because the alleys lack drainage improvments ponding during the wet season precludes their use by residents for either transportation or recreation and causes pavement to rapidly deteriorate. poor surface conditions generate sediment and hinder street sweeping for pollutant control. because the alleys aren't used by residents they are frequently used for illegal dumping. during the rainy season standing water mobilizes pollutants and either flows or is tracked onto adjoining streets where it mixes with less-polluted stormwater. the project will demonstrate how lid methods that maximize storm water infiltration on site can reduce the total runoff and associated pollutants from the alleys and make a useful neighborhood ammenity. the project will first evaluate the feasibility of replacing existing surfaces and constructing underground infiltration features in each of the nine alleys in the spartan-keys neighborhood just south of downtown san jose. based on 2010 census data most of spartan-keyes is a disadvantaged community. the city will construct at least one demonstration project at the most feasible alley to evaluate an existing conceptual design that installs permeable pavement in low-traffic areas recycled content high-albedo green concrete in high traffic areas and constructs underground infiltration galleries beneath the preamble areas to infiltrate water from the permeable areas. water quality and quantity monitoring of both pre and post project conditions will quantify pollutant loading and identify the pollutant removal rates and flow reduction benefits of the specific green infrastructure improvements. the design of the first demonstration alley can be modified as necessary for subsequent ally retrofits to achieve an overall project goal of improving all alleys within the neighborhood where an lid retrofit is feasible. ","the epa's \"protecting water quality from urban runoff\" identifies urban runoff pollutants as sediment oil grease from motor vehicles pesticides and nutrients from lawns and thermal pollution from dark surfaces. these pollutants can harm fish and wildlife kill native vegetation foul drinking water and make recreational areas unsafe and unpleasant. in their current condition neighborhood alleys are known sources of sediment and other urban pollutants to the guadalupe river. because the alleys lack drainage infrastructure ponding water has deteriorated the pavement exposing bare dirt that generates the sediment. the project will provide a durable surface in the alleys to eliminate sediment sources and will use infiltration to reduce polluted urban runoff and will use permeable pavers to infiltrate stormwater to prevent the transport of urban runoff pollutants. the epa's \"field evaluation of permeable pavements for stormwater management\" found that the use of permeable pavement systems dramatically reduced surface runoff volumes by reducing the effective impervious area. retrofit of the alleys with lid features will reduce runoff volumes and urban runoff pollutants loads and provide durable light colored surfaces to reduce heat island impacts and encourage beneficial use of the alleys. ","the san jose green alley project will reduce the quantity of urban runoff pollutants that enter the guadalupe river from the local storm drain system by creating permanent permeable surfaces within the alleys that will absorb stormwater runoff. the alley's current lack of drainage infrastructure allows ponding which concentrates pollutants that are then carried by storm water flows and tracked by vehicles onto adjacent streets. ponding also creates breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other pests. sediment control is the primary strategy to address mercury and pesticide toxicity impairments in the guadalupe river. through the same mechanism the project will also curtail local thermal pollution and reduce the amount of oil gas diesel and pahs that are transported to the guadalupe river. ","the project will improve stormwater quality by reducing the overall volume of runoff from the alleys and by preventing the mobilization of urban pollutants through runoff. the project will eliminate sediment sources by replacing deteriorated asphalt in the alleys with a durable surface of high albedo \"green concrete\" that drains to below-grade infiltration devices. on-site infiltration facilities will be sized to retain and infiltrate 80% of the annual runoff from the alleys drainage area. successful completion of the project will provide an example of how existing urban streets and alleys can be retrofitted with cost-efficient stormwater management features that provide long-term water quality benefits. the project will demonstrate how the lid practices of using permeable surfaces and on-site infiltration can be combined to retrofit a typical urban hardscape that lacks stormwater management infrastructure and has no space for above-ground stormwater features. three functional stormwater management improvements will be provided: elimination of deteriorated sediment-generating asphalt and associated ponding and conveyance of runoff through a permeable surface to infiltration facilities and storage and infiltration of the water quality design storm through subsurface infiltration trenches and dry wells. the project will create durable low-maintenance improvements that provide long-term water quality benefits to alleys in an older neighborhood typical of bay area cities.

"san francisco bay livestock and land program ","the project utilizes an incentives based approach to achieve the cultural change needed for livestock facilities to voluntarily adopt management measures that improve the healthy functioning of watersheds. specific implementation projects will be completed in high priority areas identified in watershed plans. water quality goals will be achieved through implementation projects project design technical assistance and recruitment and training. ","alameda; contra costa; solano; napa; san mateo; santa clara "," ","as early as 1/1/2013 ","24 months after start date ","the san francisco bay area is indisputably an urbanized region but its urban areas are ringed with rural properties ranchlands and parks. this ring of less dense development provides a transition to the more intensive farming landscapes of the inland valleys. despite the reduced density the rural properties grazing lands and livestock facilities in this transition zone contribute significantly to water quality impairments. the watersheds for the napa river and its tributaries like sonoma creek support numerous grazing and livestock operations that have been identified as pollutant sources in the adopted sediment and pathogen tmdls. the significance of these sources is confirmed in the recently adopted rwqcb 2 conditional waiver of waste discharge for grazing operations. in contra costa county marsh creek and kellogg creek are 303d listed for sediments pathogens and nutrients (kellogg) with over 100 permitted equestrian facilities in those watersheds. alameda creek and san francisquito creek (san mateo/santa clara) are 303d listed for sediments evidencing similar issues in the east and south bay area. further a dozen watershed plans from around the bay identify equestrian and livestock operations as priorities in need of technical assistance. due to the prevelance of program need six sf bay area resource conservation districts will collaborate to promote programming deliver technical assistance identify specific priority implementation sites and design/implement bmps on sites that will be come demonstration sites for the livestock community while protecting water quality in priority watersheds in alameda contra costa solano napa san mateo and santa clara counties. ","the project primarily protects water quality through the reduction of nutrient sediment and pathogens loads by reducing/eliminating the offsite transport of said pollutants from livestock facilities. additionally the project offers groundwater benefits in that rainwater catchment is one of the installed bmps that conserves groundwater and the proper management of manure reduces nitrate loading to shallow groundwater and infiltration sources. the implementation of bioswales and retention ponds increases the water quality and infiltration of stormwater runoff on livestock sites. ","specific goals and objectives of this project include: development of implementation sites  15 to 22 priority sites (an estimated 135 to 500 total acres) will be selected among livestock facility applicants to implement water quality bmp projects. specific bmps implemented and water quality improvements will vary based on site need and projects selected and will be designed by the technical advisory committees (tac) and consultants. these may include practice changes or infrastructure improvements. example bmps include: use of vegetative swales and buffer strips manure bunkers and other containment practices installation of gutters road and trail improvements reestablishment of vegetation and taking high use areas off line in winter. implementation sites will achieve water quality protection and serve as classrooms training opportunities and a permanent local resource for the community. bmps will be designed to meet nrcs service life standards. for each of the bmps implemented we target to reduce the exposure of 80% of the manure and 50% of the highly erodible soil and to reduce overall potential loads by 30%. we propose to measure this pollutant reduction using the load modeling tool designing projects that perform - livestock community will work with a local tac to develop the scope for implementation of water quality bmps. through site visits landowners will have one-on-one interaction with local water quality experts including nrcs who can provide site assessment detailed recommendations and design assistance. water quality site planning - all program participants will receive training on how to identify water quality challenges on their sites and the assistance needed to complete a written site plan. existing livestock and land site plan templates will be adapted if needed for each county in the project drawing from such existing models as the ranch water quality plan the nrcs conservation plan county erosion control plans and the recommendations for site planning outlined in locally adopted tmdls. all implementation project sites will be required to complete a site plan as part of their contract to receive funding for implementation projects. at least 15 implementation site owners and as many as 50 technical assistance recipients are anticipated to complete site plans during the course of this project. recruitment & technical assistance programs - provide technical training series on bmp implementation that also provides an opportunity to recruit livestock owners to participate in implementation site projects. peer leaders can also be recruited to lead and foster a peer-to-peer network of information transfer. a target 185 livestock facility owners will receive 12 hours each of technical training on water quality protective bmps and additional 240 will receive 6 hours of training. ","the napa river watershed supports numerous grazing and livestock operations that have been identified adopted sediment and pathogen tmdls as pollutant sources additionally confirmed in the recently passed rwqcb 2 conditional waiver of waste discharge (grazing operations). marsh creek and kellogg creek in contra costa county are 303d listed for sediments pathogens and nutrients (kellogg) with over 100 permitted equestrian facilities in those watersheds (see map page 2). alameda and san francisquito creeks 303d listings evidence similar issues in the south bay area. further a dozen watershed plans from around the bay identify equestrian and livestock operations as priorities for receiving technical assistance (see maps page 4 for plans and listings). the problem of pollution from livestock operations is widespread and not easily solved. barriers to managing livestock facilities in a way that are protective of water quality include: challenging site conditions historical co-locating of livestock near creeks and streams and lack of finances time and most importantly information about and peer support for protective site management practices. while nrcs can provide technical assistance and site improvement cost share for commodity-based operations via its equip program the hobbyist rural property owner and equestrian facilities are unable to access these resources and thus generally remain unserved in terms of technical assistance site assessment awareness of available resources and lack of assistance in changing to a culture where bmps are implemented as a norm. see the specific waterbodies and needs in the above question. ","without the cultural change in the livestock community of the san francisco bay area toward practices that are more protective of water quality the pollution issues identified in local watershed plans (as cited above) will continue to occur. ","while the primary justification for the project is surface water protection nitrate contamination compromises many shallow groundwater aquifers in the project area and several project target waterbodies supply drinking water reservoirs. the project will protect groundwater and surface drinking water by reducing nitrate leaching by reducing the exposure of manure to rainfall. this benefit is an important link in promoting social change as many owners of livestock facilities in these areas are also owners of private drinking water wells. the proposed project utilizes a community-based social marketing approach to achieve the cultural change needed for livestock facilities to voluntarily adopt management measures that are protective of water quality now and into the future. through technical and hands-on trainings livestock owners and managers will gain a specific understanding of how their operations contribute to sediment nutrient and pathogen pollution to surface and ground waters. they will be assisted through the process of identifying solutions and planning for improved property management practices including completing a written site plan which will guide practices in the long run. the construction of implementation sites will not only deliver immediate and lasting gains toward meeting water quality standards but also further the understanding of bmp efficacy on livestock sites. these sites will also serve the community as on the ground examples of bmps in action and serve as classrooms training opportunities and permanent local resources for the community. this project is designed to be a source reduction and pollution prevention program. for example we will both reduce the sources of and the transport of sediment off livestock facility sites. while we cannot reduce the volume of manure which is the source of nutrient and pathogen pollution targeted we will reduce the volume of manure exposed to the elements and vulnerable to mobilization. we will also reduce the transport of those pollutants off site. these reductions will be achieved via proper storage and management and drainage improvements on livestock facility sites. this strategy will be applied within all site assessment planning and bmp recommendations as well as promoted in trainings and via peer leader outreach efforts to create a pollution prevention culture among all livestock facility participants and in turn the larger community of livestock owners and borders our objective is to implement priority bmps on at least 12 livestock facility implementation sites. we also target documenting as many as 106 additional bmps implemented by technical training participants. for each of the bmps implemented we target to reduce the exposure of 80% of the manure and 50% of the highly erodible soil and to reduce overall potential loads by 30%. we propose to measure this pollutant reduction using the livestock and land load reduction modeling tool. a key challenge on west coast livestock facility sites is dust in summer mud in winter. when we reduce this source of sediment pollution from livestock impact areas and dirt roads through implementation of bmps we also decrease the dust problem a localized air quality concern in livestock facility neighborhoods during the dry season.

","water supply reliability will be enhanced by permanently reducing cii landscape irrigation demand by 6%. water quality and habitat protection and restoration efforts will benefit by eliminating dry-weather runoff from 23 acres of turf caused by irrigation systems that carry pollutants into downstream wetland habitats. ","the north san francisco bay region is home to endangered and threatened salmonids amphibians and plant species directly impacted by the availability of fresh water flows in marin and sonoma county watersheds. from a potable water supply perspective turf grass consumes more water than any other landscape plant species and accounts for a significant peak in water demand during months when rainfall is unable to meet plant demand. in addition to the quantity of fresh water water quality in wetland habitat areas is impacted by dry weather urban runoff containing biological and chemical contaminants detrimental to sensitive species. much of this dry weather inflow to habitats occurs as a direct result of landscape irrigation system runoff especially from irrigated turf areas predominantly using overhead spray and rotor-type sprinkler technology. although well managed turf grass used in active recreational areas for example can be very functional and have environmental and social benefits non-functional turf grass areas do not typically provide the same level of benefit. the total area of non-functional commercial turf in mmwd is 80 acres: this project will replace 29% of that area with climate appropriate landscaping that enhances the urban watershed and significantly reduces potable water consumption and pollution caused by irrigation runoff. project implementation will consist of a rebate program that offers cii customers a $2 per square foot incentive to replace non-functional turf grass with beneficial low water demand landscaping. eligible items will include native and climate appropriate plants drip irrigation system equipment organic soil amendments and other required materials to install an environmentally sustainable landscape. mmwd staff will administer all elements of the project including code compliance technical support marketing site inspections quality control accounting and grant administration and reporting. mmwd is a partner in the sub-regional sonoma-marin water saving partnership along with nine other north bay water agencies (partnership). the partnership has established joint water conservation goals in order to comply with sbx7-7 legislation that established mandatory gallons per capita reductions by 2020. the water savings achieved by this project will assist every agency in the partnership by reducing the total gallons per capita used in this sub-region by 2020. mmwd actively participates in numerous collaborative efforts supporting natural resources management partnering with local and regional entities to accomplish important projects supporting watershed stewardship endangered species protection and restoration vegetation management water conservation and education. the district is a partner in the tamalpais lands collaborative and also partners with local and regional entities such as the national park service california department of fish and wildlife california state parks the san francisco regional water quality control board national fish and wildlife foundation the county of marin marin county resource conservation district and a host of other government and non-profit entities to support and implement priority natural resource projects and initiatives. disadvantaged community: this project does not provide benefits specifically targeting or in support of a dac; the project will benefit the entire mmwd service area in marin county california and the bay area region in general. project scalability the scope of this project and the grant request amount are scalable. total estimated costs to implement the project at proposed scale is $2.2 million. this proposal requests $1.4 million and will accomplish $2.2 million in work. by adding or reducing 100000 square feet of turf area the proposed grant request and cost share can be scaled upwards to $2.4 million or downwards to $2.1 million. ","mmwd collects 75% of its potable water supply from rainfall on the mt. tamalpais watershed and 25% is imported from the russian river watershed in sonoma county. both of these hydrologic regions depend entirely on local rainfall for potable water supplies have very limited water storage capacity and are required by law to release significant portions of this water to support ecosystems that are home to multiple species of listed endangered and critically endangered species. this project will conserve 25.6 million gallons of potable water each year 6% of all potable water now used to irrigate cii landscapes. this project will provide drought resiliency for mmwd by conserving 25.6 million gallons of potable water annually. commercial customers will receive financial incentives and technical assistance to convert non-functional turf areas into habitat and climate appropriate landscape areas following the principles of low impact design and bay-friendly landscaping. landscapes created and maintained using these principles typically reduce potable water demand by at least 50% compared to turf grass. regional priorities addressed by this project include: reinforce/enhance water supply capacity  as this project will conserve 25.6 million gallons of potable water annually effectively adding to mmwd and the regions potable water supply. health of the bay and creeks  as this project will contribute to maintaining watershed vegetation land cover and minimize non-point source pollution resulting from urban runoff containing biological and chemical contaminants detrimental to sensitive species. ","california is currently experiencing extreme drought conditions and actions must be taken to conserve precious water supplies wherever and whenever possible. if this project is not implemented an opportunity will be lost to save a minimum of 79 af annually and permanently and replace 23 acres of non-functional urban landscape with beneficial plant species. mmwd has only 2 years of water storage capacity including 1 year of mandatory drought rationing with only one supplemental supply pipeline from the russian river watershed to the north. one third of water supply is released from mmwd reservoirs to support downstream fisheries and wetland habitats. during the next extended drought event every gallon of water will be critical to assure water availability to people and sensitive habitats. if this proposal is not implemented a significant opportunity to eliminate non-essential water use and enhance local ecosystems will be lost. project monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by mmwd staff utilizing automatic meter reading technology advanced water use tracking software and site inspections to verify that sites are following best practices for maintenance and are achieving water savings based on water budgets calculated for each site. as noted above regional priorities addressed by this project include: reinforce/enhance water supply capacity as this project will conserve 25.6 million gallons of potable water annually effectively adding to mmwd and the regions potable water supply. health of the bay and creeks as this project will contribute to maintaining watershed vegetation land cover and minimize non-point source pollution resulting from urban runoff containing biological and chemical contaminants detrimental to sensitive species. ","i. water supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) this project will permanently reduce potable water demand by more than 25 million gallons per year. benefits will accrue at a rate of 14.5 gallons per square foot converted to drip irrigation per year. ii. water quality water quality impairments will be mitigated by reducing dry weather inflows of the nutrient laden non-point-source pollution into the ms4 storm drain systems that dump into downstream wetlands. approximately 5% of water applied to commercial turf grass areas is estimated to runoff into ms4 storm drains as a result of overwatering equipment breaks and pipe leaks. this equates to more than 1.5 million gallons of water each year from the project area. water quality benefits will accrue at a rate of 1.5 gallons per square foot converted to drip irrigation per year. iv. resource stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) urban watersheds and habitat will benefit from the installation of native and climate adapted plant species that provide cover and food for pollinator and bird species. downstream wetland habitats will benefit from reduced loads of chemical nutrients and pesticides used for turf grass maintenance. the quantity of chemical reduction will be proportional to the benefit/cost ratio water conservation elements related to this project are included in propositions 50 and 84 irwm implementation grants for the bay area region. the bay areas proposition 84 round 2 irwm implementation grant includes the bay area regional conservation and education program. a rigorous benefit/cost analysis was conducted during the proposal development process which resulted in establishing a benefit/cost ratio of 1.70 for this project. as the turf replacement work included with this current concept proposal differs from this regional program in that this project consists primarily of implementation which will therefore result in higher expected water savings per dollar spent it is reasonable to assume the work proposed here would achieve a higher than 2.0 benefit/cost ratio. integration this project presents a high degree of up-front integration as it addresses priorities associated with several functional areas including water supply/water quality and watershed/habitat. as described above the project will contribute measurably to water supply reliability water quality improvement watershed habitat creation and restoration as well reductions in greenhouse gases generated by turf maintenance equipment and vehicle miles required to dispose of green waste.

","water quality benefits attributable to the project include enhanced in-stream water quality and surface water quality protection. the new channel design is expected to result in reduced sedimentation throughout the reach which will generate a reduction in suspended solids within the reach. the project will completely eliminate flooding through the 100-year fluvial event coincident with the 100-year high tide taking into account a potential 26-inch rise in sea level over the next 50 years. as such the project will provide a significant water quality benefit by preventing transport of debris and contaminants from urbanized areas to the san francisquito creek during flooding events. the project will create increased tidal marshland habitat (within new channel) at appropriate elevations for intertidal wetland plant and animal species. the project is expected to create approximately 16.1 acres of new or improved mid-marsh habitat and an estimated 4.0 acres of new or improved low-marsh habitat. another benefit will be the restoration of high tide refugial habitat for sensitive wildlife species at the ecotone between tidal wetland and upland habitats. the project will protect more than 1100 properties from creek flooding and when coupled with future tidal levee improvements will remove these properties from the fema floodplain. the downstream reach of san francisquito creek between east bayshore road and san francisco bay is at the highest risk of severe flooding in the system due to undersized channel capacity and sub-standard levees. flooding risk is exacerbated during high tides. the creek in this area runs through communities that have experienced severe damage during previous flood events which includes the disadvantaged community of east palo alto. ","following years of effort to address environmental issues and a 45-year flood in 1998 that damaged approximately 1700 properties five local agencies from two countiesthe cities of palo alto menlo park and east palo alto the county of san mateo and the santa clara valley water districtjoined together to create a new regional government agency the san francisquito creek joint powers authority (sfcjpa). the authoritys multi-jurisdictional approach to solving problems is reflected in this project; which serves to address the interrelated water quality habitat protection and restoration and flood protection needs of the region. the goal of san francisquito creek flood protection and ecosystem restoration capital improvement project east bayshore road to san francisco bay (project) is to provide protection against a 1% fluvial event coincident with a 1% tide with accommodation for 26 inches of projected sea level rise and fema freeboard requirements on san fransciquito creek between east bayshore road and the san francisco bay. the project will protect more than 1100 properties from creek flooding and when coupled with future tidal levee improvements will remove these properties from the fema floodplain. the downstream reach of san francisquito creek between east bayshore road and san francisco bay is at the highest risk of severe flooding in the system due to undersized channel capacity and sub-standard levees. flooding risk is exacerbated during high tides. the creek in this area runs through communities that have experienced severe damage during previous flood events. the completion of the east bayshore road to san francisco bay reach is a necessary first step to provide comprehensive flood protection farther upstream. the project will remove fluvial flooding risks from san francisquito creek for over 1000 properties (primary residences) within the city of east palo alto. the median household income in east palo alto is $44000 annually which is approximately 58% of the median household income (mhi) for the state of california qualifying east palo alto as a disadvantaged community (dac) as defined by the california department of finance population research unit. the project would increase stream flow capacity in san francisquito creek from the downstream face of east bayshore road to san francisco bay. it would reduce local flood risks during storm events as well as provide the capacity needed for upstream flood protection projects being planned by the san francisquito creek joint powers authority (sfcsfcjpa). increasing the creeks flow capacity from san francisco bay to highway 101 would be achieved by widening the creek channel within the reach to convey peak flows for 100-year storm events removing abandoned pg&e pipelines and configuring flood walls in the upper part of the reach for consistency with structure for caltrans enlargement of the highway 101/east bayshore road bridge over san francisquito creek. project elements include flood walls levee setbacks and creek widening in the middle reach between east palo alto and the palo alto municipal golf course. the project addresses ecosystem restoration flood management recreation and public access wetland enhancement and watershed planning. ","climate change: this project will improve marshland resiliency through improved sediment transport enhancing shoreline sustainability. by reducing fluvial aggregation and providing a source of sediment to build up high-marsh the result will be an enhanced marshland resilience which will combat rising sea levels. health of the bay and creeks: the project will create increased tidal marshland habitat (within new channel) at appropriate elevations for intertidal wetland plant and animal species. the project is expected to create approximately 16.1 acres of new or improved mid-marsh habitat and an estimated 4.0 acres of new or improved low-marsh habitat. the conversion of low quality floodplain terrace habitat to higher quality marshplain habitat dominated by native tidal salt and brackish marsh species is the key element to the restoration goals of the project. this will be accomplished by increasing the tidal prism thereby increasing the summertime salinities in the project reach and via the excavation of new marshplains to elevations that will facilitate colonization by tidal salt marsh plant species and deter colonization by ruderal species. another benefit will be the restoration of high tide refugial habitat for sensitive wildlife species at the ecotone between tidal wetland and upland habitats. this will be accomplished via a combination of grading (e.g. levee lowering and grading of stable inboard levee slopes) topsoil preparation and active revegetation. invasive species management: the conversion of low quality floodplain terrace habitat (dominated by non-native perennial pepperweed) to higher quality marshplain habitat dominated by native tidal salt and brackish marsh species is the key element to the restoration goals of the project. this will be accomplished by increasing the tidal prism thereby increasing the summertime salinities in the project reach and via the excavation of new marshplains to elevations that will facilitate colonization by tidal salt marsh plant species and deter colonization by ruderal species (e.g. perennial pepperweed). sediment management: the new channel design is expected to result in reduced sedimentation throughout the reach which will generate a reduction in suspended solids within the reach resulting in enhanced in-stream water quality. the project will protect surface water quality by completely eliminate flooding through the 100-year fluvial event coincident with the 100-year high tide taking into account a potential 26-inch rise in sea level over the next 50 years. as such the project will provide a significant water quality benefit by preventing transport of debris and contaminants from urbanized areas to the san francisquito creek during flooding events. in addition sediment transport will be improved throughout the project reach reducing fluvial aggregation and providing a source of sediment to build up high-marsh. the result will be an enhanced marshland resilience which will combat rising sea levels. riparian and fisheries restoration: san francisquito creek is unique because it remains one of the only san francisco bay streams that is not confined to a concrete channel. as a result san francisquito creek largely retains its natural character despite its urban setting and is home to many rare and threatened native species including steelhead trout. the project will result in lower velocity flows during migration season improving the conditions for the native steelhead species. ","residential flood damage assumptions without project it is estimated that approximately 703 homes 914 homes and 1090 homes would be inundated in the 25-year 50-year and 100-year flood respectively. in 2011 the total residential damages including damages to structures and content was estimated to be $18655865 $24255278 and $28925879 for the 25- 50- and 100-year flood events respectively. data related to cleanup and debris removal costs are not available and have therefore been excluded from this analysis. the majority of residences impacted by this project are located in east palo alto a dac. commercial flood damage assumptions without project in 2011 it was estimated that approximately 8 office buildings 14 office buildings and public facilities and 18 office buildings and public facilities would be affected in the 25-year 50-year and 100-year events respectively. in summary the total commercial damages including damages to structures and content is estimated to be $1216000 $2128000 and $2736000 for the 25- 50- and 100-year flood events respectively. road inundation damage assumptions without project costs associated with road inundation were estimated using the default values within the department of water resources flood rapid assessment model. these default values assume the cost per mile of highway / arterial major minor and unsealed roads to be $250000 $100000 $30000 and $10000 respectively. these assumptions are based on estimates developed for the san francisco bay area. the inundation areas identified in the project area are also located within the san francisco bay area. as such it was determined that these values reasonably reflect the costs associated with road inundation in the project area. in total these costs sum to $250000 $330000 and $475000 for the 25-year 50-year and 100-yaer floods respectively. description of without-project conditions under existing conditions tidal marshland habitat and pickleweed habitat are present but are limited to small spatial in-channel elevations due to accumulated fluvial sediments within the leveed channel throughout the project reach. the ideal elevation for these habitats is at mean higher high water or a range between the average daily high tides. the channel also serves as a migratory corridor for adult and smolt steelhead. the narrow channel and resulting high velocities limit the opportunity for adult steelhead to pass upstream to spawning areas in the upper watershed during high flow events the very events that provide for passage upstream of the project reach. ","project beneficiaries and distribution of benefits this project will benefit stakeholders at the local and regional levels. this project benefits local residents by virtually eliminating the risk of levee overtopping in storm events up to and including the 100-year flood coincident with the 100-year high tide. in addition this project will benefit regional stakeholders by eliminating the risk of flooding to highway 101. this project will provide appreciable statewide benefits by preventing water quality impacts to the san francisco bay resulting from flooding. it is estimated that approximately 703 homes 914 homes and 1090 homes would be protected from the 25-year 50-year and 100-year flood respectively. it is estimated that approximately 8 office buildings 14 office buildings and public facilities and 18 office buildings and public facilities would be protected from the 25-year 50-year and 100-year events respectively. flood damage reduction costs and benefits the project would increase stream flow capacity in san francisquito creek from the downstream face of east bayshore road to san francisco bay. it would reduce local flood risks during storm events as well as provide the capacity needed for upstream flood protection projects being planned by the san francisquito creek joint powers authority (sfcsfcjpa). increasing the creeks flow capacity from san francisco bay to highway 101 would be achieved by widening the creek channel within the reach to convey peak flows for 100-year storm events removing abandoned pg&e pipelines and configuring flood walls in the upper part of the reach for consistency with structure for caltrans enlargement of the highway 101/east bayshore road bridge over san francisquito creek. project elements include flood walls levee setbacks and creek widening in the middle reach between east palo alto and the palo alto municipal golf course. levee failure assumptions with project the project has been designed to prevent flooding in a 100-year fluvial event that coincides with the 100-year high tide taking into account a potential 26-inch rise in sea level over the next 50 years. as such there is zero probability of overtopping during a 25- year 50-year or 100-year event. description of expected water quality and other benefits with project the project will generate significant water quality and ecosystem benefits including reduced sedimentation creation of new habitat for sensitive species and improved recreational opportunities. these benefits are described in further detail below. water quality benefits water quality benefits attributable to the project include enhanced in-stream water quality and surface water quality protection. these benefits are described in the following paragraphs. enhanced in-stream water quality the new channel design is expected to result in reduced sedimentation throughout the reach which will generate a reduction in suspended solids within the reach. the magnitude of this benefit is currently unclear; as such this benefit has not been monetized. surface water quality protection implementation of this project will reduce flood-related debris and pollutant loading in san francisquito creek and the san francisco bay. currently flood waters leaving the creek channel pass through urbanized areas where they are likely to become degraded and contaminated with debris as well as water quality parameters including bacteria nutrients floating material mercury oil and grease pesticides salinity sediment settleable material suspended material. the oconnor pump station forebay is located within the inundation area. during flood events water in this forebay receives increased loading of a variety of contaminants. the oconnor pump station pumps water from the forebay back to san francisquito creek. as such the debris and contaminants introduced into the flood waters as they flow through an urbanized area are then returned to san francisquito creek where they may degrade creek water quality and pose a threat to aquatic species and sensitive habitats. the project will completely eliminate flooding through the 100-year fluvial event coincident with the 100-year high tide taking into account a potential 26-inch rise in sea level over the next 50 years. as such the project will provide a significant water quality benefit by preventing transport of debris and contaminants from urbanized areas to the san francisquito creek during flooding events. further the project will provide water quality protection for the san francisco bay. according to volume ii of the final report on san francisquito creek hydraulic modeling and floodplain mapping (floodplain modeling and mapping) which was prepared for the u.s. army corps of engineers in january of 2010 during the 250- and 500-year flood events significant volumes of flood waters leave the floodplain and are discharged to san francisco bay (385 acre-feet and 974 acre-feet respectively). as described previously these flood waters flow through urbanized areas where they are likely to become degraded and contaminated with debris as well as water quality contaminants such as bacteria nutrients floating material mercury oil and grease pesticides salinity sediment settleable material suspended material. although the project is not designed to the 250- or 500-year storm it is conservatively designed for the 100-year event. even if overtopping does occur during these events the quantity of water leaving the channel is expected to be significantly less than under the without project condition and it is possible that the floodwaters may be contained within the floodplain. as a result the project is expected to reduce pollutant loading  including mercury copper and other constituents of particular concern - to the san francisco bay during major flood events. other benefits in addition to improving water quality in san francisquito creek by reducing sedimentation the project will provide important ecologic and recreational benefits as described below. habitat creation and restoration the project will create increased tidal marshland habitat (within new channel) at appropriate elevations for intertidal wetland plant and animal species. the project is expected to create approximately 16.1 acres of new or improved mid-marsh habitat and an estimated 4.0 acres of new or improved low-marsh habitat. the conversion of low quality floodplain terrace habitat (dominated by non-native perennial pepperweed) to higher quality marshplain habitat dominated by native tidal salt and brackish marsh species is the key element to the restoration goals of the project. this will be accomplished by increasing the tidal prism thereby increasing the summertime salinities and via the excavation of new marshplains to elevations that will facilitate colonization by tidal salt marsh plant species and deter colonization by ruderal species (e.g. perennial pepperweed). another benefit will be the restoration of high tide refugial habitat for sensitive wildlife species at the ecotone between tidal wetland and upland habitats. this will be accomplished via a combination of grading (e.g. levee lowering and grading of stable inboard levee slopes) topsoil preparation and active revegetation. it is difficult to assign a value for habitat creation and restoration. the san francisco bay area is home to 500 species of wildlife 128 of them threatened or endangered like the california clapper rail and salt marsh harvest mouse. the bay is a crucial resting spot for millions of migrating birds and its sheltered waters provide critical nurseries for fish. (www.savesfbay.org/greening-bay). estuary wetlands sustain over 60 plant and animal species that are listed as rare threatened or endangered or are candidates for such listing. of the animal species the california clapper rail california least tern and salt marsh harvest mouse are best known due to their presence on several bayshore properties proposed for development; this project would provide suitable habitat for the salt marsh harvest mouse and the california clapper rail. a well-regarded technique for assigning value to habitat for wetlands is willingness to pay. a 2009 report prepared by epa entitled the economic value of coastal ecosystems in california (raheem et al 2009) summarizes ecosystem service values found by surveying available willingness-to-pay information and studies worldwide. this summary presents ecosystem service values for individual ecosystem functions (where available) as well as for bundled services (assumed aggregate value) for estuarine and beach environments. the range of values for estuarine environments was found to range from $50000 - $80000 per acre per year and beaches range from $36000 - $83000 per acre (2008 usd). specific values for marsh habitat were not provided. based on these data points the value of the wetlands created and restored by this project is conservatively estimated at $50000 per acre per year (2009 usd). this translates to an ecosystem services benefit of $1005000per year with project implementation or approximately $14227936 over the 50-year project life. enhanced recreational opportunities the project will replace the without-project pedestrian and bicycle trails along the length of the levees to be replaced or modified but the new levees will accommodate higher traffic due to increased width (16ft) along the crown of the levees. additional width of the paved or gravel trails will be created at strategic locations to provide pull out points for pedestrians or bicyclists to let maintenance vehicles travelling along the levee to pass. benches and interpretive panels will be placed at the footing of the existing friendship bridge on the east palo alto side on the new island created at the existing south footing of the friendship bridge and on the new levee on the palo alto side. information related to current use of existing recreational facilities is limited; as a result the economic value of enhanced recreational opportunities cannot be quantified. enhanced public health protection in addition to providing water quality habitat and recreation benefits this project will improve public health protection by eliminating exposure to degraded flood waters. currently this disadvantaged community experiences periodic severe flooding. according to the world health organization (who) there is an increased risk of infection of waterborne diseases when direct contact occurs with polluted flood waters through wound infections dermatitis conjunctivitis and ear nose and throat infections. one epidemic-forming disease that may be contracted from body contact with flood waters is leptospirosis a bacterial disease. leptospirosis may be transmitted through contact of the skin or mucous membranes with contaminated water damp soil or vegetation or mud contaminated with rodent urine. flooding following rainfall assists in spreading the organism due to the proliferation of rodents which shed large amounts of leptospires in their urine. leptospirosis outbreaks have occurred throughout the world with a recent (2007) outbreak on a college campus in oahu hi following a flood event. even accidental ingestion of flood waters or of water contaminated with flood waters can cause a host of infections ranging from mild to severe. a well-known example of disease outbreak following drinking water contamination occurred in walkerton ontario in 2000 in which seven people died after consuming drinking water contaminated with e. coli. in 1999 a dormitory sewage pit on county fairgrounds in new york caused a major outbreak of waterborne disease killing two people and hospitalizing 71 others. the risk of infection posed by contacting and / or ingesting flood waters is severe. by protecting this disadvantaged community from floods up to the 100-year event this project will remove the real and immediate public health risks posed by exposure to degraded flood water quality. reduced road maintenance requirements as floodwaters recede a significant volume is left behind in temporary ponds. the project will reduce ponding on streets and minimize the effect of moisture in creating potholes and cracks which make up a significant portion of street maintenance costs.

","general project concept as californias prolonged drought continues and the impacts of climate change on our water resources become more apparent the bay areas water agencies are making extraordinary efforts to reduce water demand. clearly however they cannot win this battle on their own. to complement and build on these conservation programs the accelerating sustainable landscape adoption project will harness the power of bay area city and county governments to create fundamental change in how public and private sector landscapes are designed built and managed. this project will be led by stopwaste a public agency responsible for reducing waste in alameda county. over the past 10 years stopwaste has worked with its 14 member cities and the county to adopt bay-friendly landscape policies that make urban landscapes more resilient to drought and climate change and better able to capture hold and filter stormwater. as part of this work stopwaste created the bay-friendly landscape guidelines the bay-friendly landscape rating system and other resources now managed by the regional nonprofit bay-friendly landscaping & gardening coalition. (attachment 3 provides more information about these and other bay-friendly resources and highlights results from more than 10 years of implementing bay-friendly policies and practices in alameda county.) this project will leverage these tools and strategies to accelerate a regional transformation from water-greedy lawn-centric landscapes to california-friendly landscapes that naturally thrive in a summer-dry drought-prone climate. what will be implemented the projects main focus is to leverage change where local governments have the greatest influence on landscape practices: the public properties they own and maintain and the new landscape projects they issue permits for. individually few local governments have the resources or expertise to envision and enact landscape policies that provide a comprehensive approach to drought and climate resilience. to address this need this project will convene a public agency landscape council that will serve as a forum for local governments to coordinate efforts pool resources and replicate successes. this project will also provide technical assistance to local governments to help them adopt implement and enforce regionally consistent policies that meet the comprehensive bay-friendly standard. these activities will send a clear signal to the landscape industry that investments in staff training and new business practices will be rewarded with greater demand for bay-friendly landscape services. to complement the public sector activities this project will expand the bay-friendly qualified professional training program to include courses in marketing sustainable landscape services as well as specialized training in the design construction and management of lid stormwater systems. this project will also provide incentives to high profile commercial properties in the region to convert their conventional landscapes to sustainable bay-friendly landscapes. as local governments and businesses implement sustainable landscape practices on highly visible public properties such as parks civic centers street medians and office parks homeowners take notice and are more likely to make similar changes to their properties. this project will amplify this ripple effect by providing how-to education to homeowners via workshops videos and other outreach. how the project will function stopwaste will administer the dwr grant and partner with the bay-friendly coalition to convene the regional public agency council and establish mechanisms for delivering technical assistance and policy support to local governments throughout the bay area irwm region. in preliminary discussions with stopwaste a number of cities counties and other local government entities have expressed strong interest in this project concept. the projects training and outreach activities will be managed by the bay-friendly coalition which currently offers landscape professional training and homeowner education funded in part by prop. 84. regional coordination the paradigm for this project  that local governments can work together to accelerate a regional shift to more sustainable and water-efficient landscape practices  has precedent in the bay areas building sector. in the early 2000s stopwaste helped launch a nonprofit organization build it green (big). one of bigs core activities was to convene a green building public agency council to provide policy and technical support to local governments. at the outset of this process only one city in the bay area had a green building policy. by 2010 most cities and counties had green building requirements local governments were leading by example by making civic buildings greener and more energy efficient and the regions public agencies and building professionals were well ahead of the curve when calgreen the statewide mandatory green building code went into effect in 2011. gov. browns april 1 2015 executive order directs the department of water resources to update the state model water efficient landscape ordinance (welo) to increase water efficiency and promote compliance. leveraging the regions proven model for shifting the building sector toward greater sustainability this project will position bay area cities and counties to be leaders in the welo update process and to help steer the regions residential and commercial property owners to more sustainable and water-efficient practices. dac benefits as a result of this project public parks street medians and other public properties will be renovated and managed according to bay-friendly principles that lead to safer healthier more beautiful neighborhoods providing a direct benefit to disadvantaged communities. ","californias historic drought and the unprecedented statewide mandatory water reductions recently announced are focusing greater attention on the potential impacts of climate change on the bay areas water resources. these include more variable weather and precipitation patterns including longer and more severe droughts and more intense downpours that may exacerbate flood risks. in addition experts project loss of at least 25% of the sierra snowpack by 2050 meaning less water will be available to use. (source: department of water resources www.water.ca.gov/climatechange.) the accelerating sustainable landscape adoption project will address these challenges by accelerating the transition from conventional to bay-friendly landscape design construction and maintenance practices throughout the bairwm region. the bay-friendly approach to landscaping goes beyond drought tolerance. it emphasizes ecologically and economically sound practices that make urban landscapes more adaptive and resilient in the face of a rapidly changing climate. water supply need: this project will increase local governments adoption of policies based on comprehensive sustainable landscape practices such as the bay-friendly landscape standard. the bay-friendly approach has been shown to reduce irrigation water use by 50% to 90% compared to conventional landscaping. it does this holistically by addressing the total landscape starting with the soil which is often overlooked by water efficiency programs but is critical to long-term water conservation and many other benefits. the bay-friendly approach ensures that compost and mulch are used to increase the soils organic matter content to at least 3.5% and preferably 5%. organic matter acts like a sponge holding water in the root zone longer decreasing loss to evaporation increasing infiltration improving plant health and breaking down pollutants. the holistic bay-friendly approach also includes installing low water using plants avoiding overplanting and designing and installing efficient irrigation systems. water quality need: the bay-friendly standards promoted by this project improve water quality in the bay area region by reducing or eliminating the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers reducing runoff and improving the health of soil and its ability to break down and filter contaminants. flood control need: this project will improve regional stormwater management by promoting a comprehensive set of best practices that reduce runoff and keep stormwater onsite. (bay-friendly landscapes rigorous standards are designated as best management practices in the regional water quality control boards municipal regional stormwater npdes permit from 2009 to the present.) infiltration is improved through strategies such as increased organic matter content in soil permeable paving bioswales rain gardens and other lid features. resource stewardship need: in addition to conserving water and protecting water quality the bay-friendly approach protects habitat by encouraging the use of a diverse palette of native plant species and avoiding the introduction of invasive horticultural species. it provides broad benefits related to land use including decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 53 mtco2e per acre creating and protecting habitat and providing public health benefits. ","as a result of the drought and ongoing outreach by the regions water conservation programs more people now understand the importance of using less water on their lawns and gardens. however programs and policies with an overly narrow focus on water conservation may have unintended negative consequences. without the regional coordination and holistic approach promoted by this proposal most public and private landscape construction and renovation projects will not implement proven strategies that provide holistic benefits for the regions water resources environment and economy. specifically if this proposal is not implemented the following critical impacts are likely to occur: inconsistent policies and laws. while the states model water efficient landscape ordinance (welo) provides a code baseline it has not gone far enough in its conservation or compliance requirements. also it is strictly focused on water efficiency rather than addressing the impacts of landscapes on water resources in a more holistic way. gov. browns april 1 2015 executive order directs the department of water resources to update welo. however without a regional forum for local governments to strengthen their policy and technical expertise and to agree on proven best management practices local adaptation and adoption of welo updates may result in an patchwork of inconsistent policies and enforcement protocols. limited leadership. the region will miss out on the opportunity to have local governments lead by example and show property owners how to create beautiful landscapes that are drought and climate resilient.missed opportunities for lasting improvement. the extended drought provides a perfect time to promote the adoption of a california landscape aesthetic vs. the english garden aesthetic of conventional landscapes. property owners may replace lawns with landscapes that produce short-term reductions in water use but that may struggle to thrive due to poor soils and be less resilient with extended warmer temperatures and less summer irrigation. see the sheet mulch it! brochure (attachment 1) for a detailed comparison of the benefits of conventional lawn removal vs. a sustainable approach to lawn conversion. short-sighted actions. property owners may think that paving over their lawns or letting them lawns die is a reasonable response to the drought not realizing the negative impacts this will have on the urban heat island effect stormwater runoff wildlife habitat and other critical regional issues. to combat climate change we need a healthy urban forest and landscapes that can store carbon cool and clean the air and survive with less irrigation.wasted public resources. local governments will lack a mechanism for collaborating and sharing their successes and challenges with policies and practices related to sustainable landscaping. uninformed choices and unintended consequences. more invasive species are likely to be planted because landscape professionals and property owners will focus on drought tolerant plants without taking into account other important considerations. invasive species crowd out native species choke waterways degrade habitats and burden public agencies with more than $80 million annually in management and removal costs. excessive landfill waste. gov. browns executive order calls for the replacement of 50 million square feet of lawn with drought tolerant landscapes. the conventional method of lawn replacement is to rip out the lawn. since sod is not accepted at compost facilities this could result in up to 100000 tons of sod going to landfill. moreover the conventional lawn replacement method is a missed opportunity to provide the soil with valuable water-conserving organic matter. the bay-friendly method of lawn conversion uses sheet mulch a zero waste environmentally superior alternative to conventional lawn removal. (see attachment 1 for a comparison of conventional and sheet mulch lawn conversion methods.)missing fundamental principles. landscape professionals and property owners will be narrowly focused on simply replacing lawns with drought tolerant plants without understanding the important role that healthy soils rich in organic matter play in conserving water and protecting water quality and plant health.diminished statewide influence. bay area governments will be in a more reactive and disorganized state as the process unfolds for updating the state model water efficiency landscape ordinance as required by gov. browns executive order b-29-15.

"building climate change resiliency along the bay with green infrastructure & treated wastewater ","building climate change resiliency along the bay shoreline with green infrastructure and treated wastewater proposes to establish a partnership to construct a series of pilot ecotone slope projects integrated with san francisco bay wastewater treatment plants. the goals of this project are: to improve wastewater treatment by using natural marsh habitats to pre-treat pollutants; to protect vulnerable wastewater treatment plants and adjacent improvements from rising sea levels; to use treated wastewater as a resource in marsh restoration; to integrate ongoing restoration of adjacent tidal wetland habitats into a larger design to employ those restored marshes as natural barriers against regional flooding and sea level rise; and to investigate new opportunities for wastewater plants to lower their nutrient and emerging contaminant discharges to the bay by using the green infrastructure model. ","alameda; santa clara?; marin? ","37.6671 | -122.1567 ","ongoing ","tbd ","oro loma sanitary district ","the project involves the construction of shallow upland / high marsh ecotone slopes bayward of existing flood risk management levees. the ecotone slope serves to provide protection from rising sea levels further removal of nutrients from secondary effluent water reuse at a potw; the reuse (treatment through ecotone wetlands) will improve water quality (removing nutrients; stormwater will also be treated at the ecotone; a net increase in wetlands will occur (providing increased habitat); building increased elevation wetlands around the bay will reduce flooding under rising sea level. wastewater treatment plants of the future will be moving away from the goal of wastewater treatment and towards a framework of resource recovery. wastewater contains two major resources that are important to the ecology of coastal ecosystems: fresh water and nutrients. fresh water will be crucial in replenishing a coastal habitat type that has been removed from the bay as streams were channelizedthe movement of groundwater into the ecotone slope. in addition wastewater contains nutrients that can stimulate the growth of wetlands around the bay. the proposed project lights the way for the future framework  making the best use of the current fresh water resource. ","at least 22 wastewater treatment plants around san francisco bay are vulnerable to the effects of sea level rise over the next century. oro loma sanitary district (olsd) has a conceptual design to create a seepage ecotone slope to restore historical moist grassland / bayland ecotone while treating reclaimed wastewater from equalization facilities and increasing its resilience to sea level rise. this project will be permitted and constructed as the first demonstration project of building resiliency along the bay with green infrastructure and treated wastewater. additionally a treatment facility retrofit that supports wetlands accretion will be designed and permitted at union sanitary district city of hayward and novato sanitary district based upon confirmation of the expected results in the pilot study. a scientific peer-review committee will be convened to provide technical review and guidance for the project both for the treatment wetlands and the ecotone slope. the interdisciplinary committee will consist of leading scientists practitioners and managers from around the bay who are well versed in the challenges opportunities and questions that the project raises. the advisory committee will provide guidance for design monitoring design adaptive management and analysis of results. in addition to the design permitting and construction of innovative treatment facilities the demonstration project will generate design guidance and implementation recommendations that will be disseminated through outreach to the bay areas many wastewater treatment facilities. the potential impact of this project is vast: if 25 percent of the bay areas wastewater treatment plants are able to build ecotone slopes (based upon oro lomas successful demonstration) then over 5000 acres of moist grassland / bayland ecotone can be created around the bay. the aim of the partnership is to expand its membership to include all bay potws and adjacent land use management agencies in a unified effort to test refine and construct the new green infrastructure paradigm. the outreach component of the project will include development and dissemination of program material in print and electronic form; meetings with prospective potw and land use management agency partners to keep them updated about progress and discuss program findings; meetings with regional policy makers to inform them about program details including costs and benefits; meetings with community and civic organizations to build understanding and support for the project; meetings with state and federal elected officials who are ultimately responsible for oversight of program authorization and funding; and outreach to key news media providers to promote broad public awareness of and support for the project. ","by 2050 sea level rise models show strong agreement for global sea level rise with an average of 14 inches higher than the sea level in 2000. beyond 2050 the projections of global sea level rise depend upon the emissions generated in this century with up to 55 inches of sea level rise projected by 2100. given that many wastewater treatment plants are located by necessity at the edge of the bay lowest elevations within a community citizens may suffer if the plants are compromised by inundation from rising sea levels. impaired water quality and higher temperatures can result in algal blooms and a higher potential for the spread of water-borne disease vectors. this raises key questions for resource managers in relation to climate change: identifying opportunities for tidal wetlands and mudflats to migrate landward managing and maintaining marsh accretion developing and planning for natural flood protection and maintaining sufficient upland buffer areas around tidal wetlands. furthermore rare and valuable habitats like the moist grassland / bayland ecotone are a high priority for restoration and conservation. in addition to addressing sea level rise there are growing concerns in the san francisco bay related to nutrient levels and contaminants of emerging concern (cec). historically algal production in the bay has been inhibited by a lack of light. now the bay is clearer allowing light to pass. sampling throughout the bay indicates increasing levels of chlorophyll an indicator for potential algal blooms. these factors are causing the regional water quality control board to focus on the issue collect additional data and plan for ways to reduce nutrient loads to the bay. the proposed project has the capability to provide nutrient and cec removal from the receiving waters. ","more than 50000 acres of former and existing tidal marshes are immediately adjacent to the heavily developed urban shoreline of southern san francisco bay. an aging network of earthen levees provides flood protection for the developed shore. sea level rise already is compromising the integrity of the levee system and causing increasingly frequent flooding of developed areas. this condition is forecast to get worse as sea level continues to rise. major regional transportation corridors including highway and rail commercial and residential property and critical infrastructure such as potws are at risk. the project will demonstrate the advantages of employing the ecosystem services provided by a restored marsh system to provide critical flood and water quality protection benefits during the current era of sea level rise. the alternative approach of using traditional hardscape methods to safeguard existing public services would certainly be far more costly perhaps prohibitively so. in addition large areas of marshes that are currently being restored would be threatened by flooding from sea level rise and contamination from failure to manage waste and storm water effectively. further the specific green infrastructure feature that is the centerpiece of the oro loma projectthe ecotoneis targeted as central to the success of endangered species recovery. the draft recovery plan for tidal marsh ecosystems of northern and central california places priority on re-establishing terrestrial ecotones that provide high tide flood refuge cover and seasonal (spring) grassland foraging for the salt marsh harvest mouse. the list of wetland functions deemed to be of outstanding public interest that the proposed project will significantly improve include: food chain production habitat for aquatic and land species; dynamic surface water storage; energy dissipation; groundwater flow; nutrient cycling; removal of elements and compounds; retention of particulates; sequestration of organic carbon; maintenance of scarce plant community; maintenance of characteristic detrital biomass; maintenance of spatial structure of habitat etc. the opportunity for improving these wetlands functions at treatment plants will be lost. ","the seepage flow through an ecotone slope provides an effective low cost low energy and environmentally sustainable method to nearly eliminate nutrient loadings and cecs from the receiving waters. if proven successfully the project has the potential to radically improve water quality in the san francisco bay. the project has significant flood and stormwater management benefits. the proposed ecotone slopes primary function is to provide an environmentally friendly adaptable and robust defense against flooding associated with sea level rise. during dry weather periods urban stormwater can be routed through the ecotone slope to provide treatment of common fertilizer hydrocarbon and sediment based pollutants. the proposed pilot project on the oro loma site will incorporate this concept by routing stormwater from an industrialized area into the ecotone. the oro loma seepage ecotone slope will be the first bay area project to replicate an engineered equivalent of moist grassland / bayland ecotone of broad flat alluvial fans that historically graded into the tidal marshes of most of south san francisco bay. historically moist grasslands vegetation (lowland wet grassland and sedge-rush meadows) were prevalent along the estuary and in the san lorenzo watershed. this now rare groundwater-seep-dependent ecotone will provide important seasonal terrestrial habitat for nesting mallards and the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse (spring foraging habitat and increasingly important terrestrial high tide refuge) particularly as sea level rises. groundwater soil and vegetation interactions of wet meadows will support important carbon and biogeochemical nutrient transformation and sequestration processes that are currently excluded from diked baylands and tidal marshes disconnected from groundwater discharges. additionally the project will work with resource managers (hayward recreational park district bay trail) to ensure genuine stewardship of the wetlands around the bay.

","the site was used for urban landfill from the 1950s to the early 1980s with fill consisting mainly of construction debris containing concrete asphalt metals and foundry slag. currently the shoreline is lined with large chunks of rubble deep voids between pieces of debris and expanses of loose soil adjacent to and eroding into san francisco bay. the restoration project located in a cove along the southern portion of an area known as the albany neck will produce comprehensive shoreline stabilization which will reduce erosion and sedimentation into the bay thereby improving water quality and create and enhance rocky intertidal habitat along the south side of albany neck provide sandy beach dune habitat improvements expand and enhance wetlands and provide improved public access. the project places the highest priority for improvements on areas of observed erosion that potentially threaten water quality and stability of landfill areas. the site acquired in 1998 in partnership with california department of parks and recreation is subject to california regional water quality control board's order no. 98-072 (board order) which directed remediation of hazardous materials found in the landfill. since the implementation of the board order in 1998 shoreline erosion has accelerated and now exposes undocumented landfill debris to wave action from the san francisco bay. the project will correct this condition by constructing a stabilized shoreline barrier that prevents discharge of wastes or hazardous substances to the san francisco bay. project design will further develop hydro-dynamic modeling data developed in a feasibility study for the stabilization and protective barrier features to withstand 100-year sea level rise projections. approximately 1700 feet of shoreline will be improved by removing debris including large rubble (concrete and asphalt) and hazardous objects and invasive vegetation. rock clusters/groins will be placed to create a more topographically diverse intertidal shoreline and anchor pocket beaches. rock clusters will stabilize and trap sand to help create and maintain new beach features and improve habitat values. habitat design and function will account for anticipated sea-level rise and incorporate features that support desired habitat conditions for native rockweed (fucus gardneri) which provides both physical habitat and food for fish shorebirds and macro-invertebrates. ","the neck is an armored and reflective (wave energy) feature which is actively eroding to varying degrees based on location and orientation as well as topographic and material conditions. an ad hoc mix of materials consisting of concrete construction debris and rock armor the shoreline along the neck. high wave runup and overtopping events induce erosion within the bank which damages the integrity of the nonengineered structure and threatens the upper sections of the slope including existing pathways. specifically the toe is eroding due to the reflection of incident wave energy. the reflected wave energy is focused onto the corner at the beach. portions of the existing trail and areas under consideration for future public access are impacted by the runup and overtopping events. the current configuration and conditions of the shoreline along the southern edge of the neck will not support proposed habitat enhancement and public access improvements over time. erosion along the neck shoreline will increase as sea level rises which will allow larger waves to impact and degrade the neck shoreline. although the structure is fixed in place the toe and crest of the neck will experience greater rates and frequency of erosion by wave runup and overtopping. the trail behind the crest will also be susceptible to damage by wave overtopping. the steep slopes located on the southern shoreline of the neck are subject to erosion from both storm water runoff across the slope face and waves along the toe of slope. the surface of the neck and plateau is also subject to erosion from storm water runoff. concrete and other construction debris can exacerbate erosion by concentrating and focusing flows onto less resistant materials leading to piping of soils through the fill matrix. relative sea level rise projections specific to the albany shoreline should account for issues such as land subsidence rates as well as the range of uncertainty in selected sea level rise projections. the geologically young bay muds and fill materials on the albany peninsula are relatively uncompacted and unsettled which may lead to consolidation and settlement or subsidence over time on the order of 1.5 to 5 feet. settlement at the plateau neck and bulb is expected to occur based upon two separate mechanisms: compression of debris fill and consolidation of bay mud. the compression of the fill is expected to occur due to raveling (movement of fine particles into voids) decomposition chemical reactions and compaction and consolidation due to self-weight of the fill. the consolidation of underlying bay mud is expected to occur due to the weight of the overlying fill. settlement would most likely manifest itself as undulations on the ground surface. it is estimated that the plateau area will settle between 2 to 2.75 feet over the period from 1989 to 2039. additional settlement could occur in the plateau area due to new loads (additional fill or building loads) transferred to the underlying bay mud layer. in addition subsidence will influence erosion risk and the suitability of soil types for specific restoration and improvement measures. surface erosion is expected to be an ongoing geotechnical issue on the bulb neck and plateau. the primary threats to sensitive habitats in the study area are disturbance from public access (e.g. people and dogs) and sea level rise. under existing conditions the shoreline beach and dunes have little or no room to adapt (move landward) in response to sea level rise. protection of sensitive habitats within the albany beach study area will require protection measures that can be implemented immediately (e.g. fencing signage) in combination with long-term approaches for managing these habitats over time with respect to sea level rise conditions (e.g. expansion stabilization). opportunities for preservation and protection of many of the sensitive habitats at albany beach are directly linked to suggested actions for shoreline protection and beach dune and wetland expansion. ","a goal of the proposed project design is to comply with waste discharge requirement order 98-072 issued by the regional board. to achieve compliance implementation of the landfill shoreline stabilization and trail enhancement on albany neck will avoid landfill waste coming into contact with ponded water from any source; deposition of further waste deposited or stored at the site; or leachate from landfill waste and ponded water containing leachate or in contact with solid wastes from the landfill being discharged to waters of the state or united states. the proposed project places a high priority on maintaining the landfill cap and avoiding water quality impacts to san francisco bay. without comprehensive shoreline stabilization future shoreline failure could cause erosion of landfill material into san francisco bay and violate the waste discharge requirements of regional water quality control board order. partial or patchy repair of eroded areas would contribute to shoreline weakness where repaired areas transition to non-engineered fill. these transitional points of contact over time will likely fail causing erosion to spread to other areas. failed areas would require continual maintenance and shoreline stabilization. within areas of shoreline fill that were not properly engineered (i.e. existing condition) anticipated sea level rise will cause new areas of erosion and shoreline failure. a one-time comprehensive repair will be expensive but in the long term is more cost effective because patch repairs and substantial long-term maintenance burdens will be avoided. improve site drainage and water quality: direct surface runoff generated on the site through a system of bioswales or vegetated channels integrated with the existing back dune wetlands. expansion of the wetland beyond the existing property boundary is an opportunity to increase storm water storage and passive treatment capacity. stabilize eroding shoreline: stabilization of eroding shorelines is an opportunity to limit sedimentation and degradation of sensitive habitats. improve stormwater drainage and trail surface: regrade the trail on the southern slope of the neck to improve drainage and sediment control direct surface runoff generated on the trail system to bioswales or vegetated channels for improved percolation and on-site treatment. flood and stormwater management is about at the seaward edge of the trail or the top of the armor. the roughness of the existing armor and rubble limits the height that the runup could potentially reach but the trail is impacted and likely contributes to winnowing and erosion along the trail. along the beach significant flooding is expected. although the runup is lower at the beach because the slope is flatter low areas and pathways through the dunes could cause significant flooding in and behind the dunes. along the south shoreline the ground elevation is significantly lower than the runup elevation and waves are expected to reach approximately 50 feet inland. the estimates for total water level (twl) will guide planning evaluation and design of restoration and public access improvements for albany beach. appropriate consideration of the future twl conditions and influence on the site will also provide a framework for adaptive management and maintenance of the site. the project will protect the dune habitat at the albany beach by introducing fencing. dune vegetation will be restored by removing noxious weeds (e.g. iceplant and kikuyu grass) and planting locally native species that are adapted to this habitat and explore the feasibility of re-introducing rare or endangered species that are native to the bay area such as california seablite san francisco spineflower and robust spineflower to the dune area. the project will expand the dune areas behind the beach and protect and enhance eelgrass beds that exist off albany beach. it will enhance beach/bay access and create bay water trail access for non-motorized watercraft by creating a vehicle drop-off and parking at the south end of the beach. installation of park furnishings such as restrooms benches and interpretive signage will significantly enhance the recreational experience of park visitors. an improved segment of the san francisco bay trail adjacent the beach area will close a key gap in the san francisco bay trail.

","construct a row of sheet piles and associated bank stabilization and revegetation in rodeo creek to stop the upward migration of a large destabilizing head cut in the creek. the sheet piles can be located downstream closer to current location of the head cut but the more logical location for construction and maintenance is at the christy road crossing of the creek located about 500 feet upstream of the head cut. here the sheet piles can be installed below the existing grade and would then be available to counteract the upward migration of the head cut. full stabilization of rodeo creek is unlikely and impractical. but some tree planting efforts would be included to partially counteract the mature trees that have already been undermined and collapsed into the quickly deepening creek. ","rodeo creek has long exhibited signs of severe erosion and channel degradation in the upper portion of the watershed. this has forced relocation of underground utilities crossing the creek and a large retaining wall to hold up the adjacent roadway and railroad. survey monitoring of the the channel indicate that the channel invert has dropped over 9 feet in 14 years. this is not normal erosion. portions of the creek below the headcut are over 40 feet deep. at the christy road crossing with roughly the same tributary area in the creek rodeo creek is approximately 15 feet deep. the headcut is moving upstream and true creek stability is elusive. ","if no grade control is introduced eventually christy road (a county-maintained roadway) will be washed out and a much large bridge would be needed to span the expanded unstable creek. creek bed and banks (and mature riparian vegetation) will continue to be lost. to head off this possibility burried driven sheet piles should be installed just downstream of the existing road crossing. ","stabilizing the creek will greatly reduce the sediment load that is being dumped into the creek. stabilizing the creek upstream means less sediment accumulating in populated areas downstream. this leaves more capacity in the creek for flood flows. the stabilization of rodeo creek prevents the destruction of riparian vegetation and habitat.

","the regional sea level rise adaptation strategy would be pursued initially in three phases: (1) considering sea level rise exposure in the current scs and its environmental impact report; (2) convening and supporting subregional and local sea level rise adaptation planning efforts and incorporating lessons learned in the regions second scs; and (3) developing a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy that integrates tasks one and two and incorporates protection of regionally important environmental resources. sea level rise adaptation planning is an ongoing iterative process based on the concept of adaptive management. because sea level will continue rising over time new and different adaptation strategies will need to be conceived tested funded and implemented on an ongoing basis to adapt to these changing circumstances and to the lessons learned from earlier efforts. it is important to note that while the sea level rise work is underway regional and local stakeholders will also be moving forward with adaptation planning for heat waves energy shortages drought and other climate impacts. these two tracks need to be closely coordinated and eventually brought together in the second and third iterations of the scs. the logistics and timelines for developing these other strategies will be coordinated through the bay area climate and energy resilience project which is being managed by the joint policy committee consultants. the implementation of the sea level rise work plan would be undertaken by abag and bcdc in consultation with the staffs of mtc baaqmd and the coastal conservancy which in partnership with abag administers the san francisco bay restoration authority a potential source of revenue for flood protection and wetland restoration. the work plan would be carried out in coordination with the bay area flood protection agencies association and integrated into the bay area integrated regional water management plan (irwmp) which coordinates the work of the many organizations and agencies that deal with water management and habitat protection. the coastal conservancy plays a key role in the management of the irwmp. the entire effort is expected to take between five and ten years depending on available funding and other resources. funding for the project would come from a variety of sources including grants and in-kind resources from federal agencies foundations state and regional agencies and local governments. ","1. what is the relative importance of addressing the project or issue in achieving the goals of economic prosperity and environmental sustainability in the bay area? sea level rise from global warming is a fact. water levels in san francisco bay have risen nearly eight inches over the past century and scientists agree that the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. while exact future increases in sea level rise are uncertain the state of california has adopted guidance for state agencies which indicates that bay may rise 10 to 17 inches by 2050 17 to 32 inches by 2070 and 31 to 69 inches by the end of the century. sea level rise is a particularly acute problem for the bay area because 240 square miles of shoreline land was reclaimed from the bay by filling it just high enough to be above past sea level but not above future sea level. also because of land subsidence parts of the south bay where a number of high-profile silicon valley companies are located are below current sea level. approximately 330 square miles of low-lying land around the bay may be vulnerable to sea level rise over the next century. numerous critical regional assets are located within these areas vulnerable to flooding. some of these assets include san franciscos financial district mission bay treasure island san francisco international airport oakland international airport the headquarters of a number of silicon valley companies highways railroads and communities. in addition to determining how best to protect existing economic assets the bay area needs a cohesive strategy for increasing job growth and enhancing economic prosperity in the decades ahead. to achieve these goals it will be necessary to continue to attract private investment capital to the bay region. if investors are concerned about the long-term economic viability of development located in areas vulnerable to flooding or if underwriters will not insure such development the bay area will be at a distinct competitive disadvantage in securing this needed investment capital. therefore a regional strategy for addressing sea level rise adaptation is critical to the regions continued economic prosperity. other regions states and nations that are facing flood danger from sea level rise are embarking on programs to deal with this challenge. a sea level rise adaptation strategy for san diego bay has been prepared by iclei local governments for sustainability through a collaborative regional stakeholder process that included most of the public agencies and private sector representatives with a major interest in the future of san diego bay. four florida counties have established the southeast florida regional climate change compact to partner in mitigating the causes and adapting to the consequences of climate change particularly flooding. recognizing that new york city has more than 520 miles of coastline and is among the top ten port cities in the world that are most exposed to coastal flooding new york citys plan called planyc is being updated to deal with the complex welter of climate issues facing the city. delaware is developing a plan for sea level rise that will recommend policy changes and practices to ensure that delaware makes informed policy and investment decisions to prevent damage and losses to infrastructure resources and homes. to avoid losses from flooding the province of british columbia canada is incorporating sea level rise projections into coastal management practices and planning. the city of vancouver british columbia has designed a climate change adaptation strategy to tackle a potential increase in street flooding sewer backups damaged forests and heat-related illnesses. toronto and halifax already have such plans in place. rotterdam netherlands has an overarching adaptation plan called rotterdam climate proof which allows for climate considerations across all departments and infrastructure types and enables innovative projects and widespread policy changes. a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy is also critical to the environmental sustainability of the bay area. the goal of the south bay salt pond restoration project is to enhance over 16000 acres of diked ponds formerly used for salt making. an additional 10000 acres of former salt ponds in the north bay are being restored to wetlands in the napa-sonoma marsh restoration project. together these two initiatives form the nations largest wetland restoration project outside the everglades. wetlands provide flood protection by attenuating wave energy. however tidal wetlands exist only at intertidal elevations and are therefore vulnerable to sea level rise. moreover some undeveloped low-lying areas that are vulnerable to shoreline flooding contain important habitat or provide opportunities for habitat enhancement. in these areas development could preclude wetland enhancement. therefore protecting existing wetlands and addressing the trade-off between development and habitat enhancement is critical to the environmental and economic sustainability of the bay area. 2. how broad is the support among government equity environmental and business interests for the jpc to provide leadership on the project or issue? it took bcdc over five years to formulate the bay plan climate change amendment the commission adopted in late 2011. during the 26-month public review period bcdc held 36 public hearings workshops and stakeholder meetings which which were contentious at times. some development and business interests initially argued that the proposed policies would discourage development and economic investment in the bay area while environmental groups pressed bcdc to issue a moratorium on new shoreline development. local governments also raised concerns about the policies fearing that they would allow bcdc to intrude into local planning decisions. to deal with these concerns bcdc met with local governments and extended the public comment period for several months. throughout this process the amendment language was revised and refined to respond to the excellent ideas advanced by stakeholders local governments and the general public. in the end the business community developers labor and environmental organizations and local governments supported the amended policies and bcdc unanimously approved the amendment. one of the critical elements in securing this support was bcdcs position that the jpc should take the lead in formulating a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy and that the strategy should be integrated with the planning of the other jpc member agencies. therefore there is broad support for the jpc to provide regional leadership on the issue of sea level rise. 3. if the jpc does not provide leadership on the project or issue will another entity do so? given the magnitude of the threat posed by sea level rise to shoreline assets communities and resources it is inevitable that some entity (or entities) will deal with the issueeventually. the question is whether this action will come about only after a series of floods make the vulnerability more obvious or whether new laws or other external pressure mandate the jpc (or another entity) to assume a leadership role. some individual local jurisdictions are studying the impacts of sea level rise and beginning to incorporate consideration of greater coastal flooding into their planning. for example the san francisco public utilities commission is planning to retrofit shoreline sewage treatment facilities to prevent flood damage and the city of mountain view has allocated $300000 to study the impacts of sea level rise. on a broader scale sub-regional efforts are coordinating sea level rise planning across a number of jurisdictions. the bcdc-initiated adapting to rising tides project is a multi-jurisdictional partnership that is assessing flood vulnerability and risk assessment along a portion of the alameda county shoreline from emeryville to union city. the san francisquito creek joint powers authority is leading a consortium of county and city agencies to formulate an integrated shoreline and watershed flood protection strategy for the communities along san francisquito creek in san mateo and santa clara counties. a public/private partnership in silicon valley aims to raise over $1 billion over the next decade to build engineered levees from redwood city around the south end of the bay up to hayward and to contribute to the south bay salt pond restoration project. while these individual local efforts are valuable and the sub-regional pilot projects will provide valuable information and intergovernmental approaches ultimately some aspects of sea level rise have regional impacts that require a regional response. fifty-five local governments have land use authority over portions of the 1000 miles of bay shoreline. special districts which have no land use authority have the responsibility for flood protection along much of the shoreline. other special districts are responsible for wetland restoration which can play a critical role in a regional sea level rise and flood protection strategy. coordination among these entities is essential in formulating a strategy that has no weak points in the flood protection system and can protect resources that span jurisdictions. the state of california took an important leadership role on climate change adaptation when it released the california climate adaptation strategy in 2009. that strategy was directed primarily to actions state agencies should take to prepare for the impacts of climate change in the decades ahead. the state is currently in the process of updating that strategy and expanding it to include actions local governments could (and should) be taking. while such actions are not currently mandated by the state if it becomes clear that the states interests cannot be advanced without local engagement legislation could be enacted to achieve this. thus jpc leadership on a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy can be seen as more of an opportunity than an obligation. regional leadership is clearly needed. if the jpc does not exercise that leadership now either some other entity may eventually do so at its own initiative or the jpc or some entity may be required to do so. the jpc provides this leadership now in a manner that reflects the perspectives of its member agencies and advances the regional interests of the bay area. therefore it would be prudent for the jpc to proactively take on this leadership role now rather than have to react to a possible future initiative that may not be fully consistent with bay area conditions. finally the jpc already has the responsibility for coordinating the activities of its four member agencies in the development of the sustainable communities strategy. it is critical that any regional sea level rise adaptation strategy be integrated to the maximum degree feasible into the scs that is scheduled to be adopted in 2013 and be fully integrated into the next iterations of the scs that will be adopted ever four years thereafter. therefore the jpc is uniquely positioned to provide regional leadership on a sea level rise adaptation strategy. 4. are resources available to support the jpcs leadership role on the project or issue? abag bcdc and mtc have some existing financial resources that have been committed to continuing current assessments of sea level rise and formulating adaptation measures. however there are no funds currently appropriated for or specifically available to formulate a comprehensive regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. however the four regional agencies have been effective in generating financial support that is needed to advance regional objectives. over the past five years bcdc has been able to secure $1.72 million from federal grants special funds and other sources to undertake its pioneering work in sea level rise assessment and planning for the bay area. the baaqmd faced a similar problem when it decided to integrate consideration of greenhouse gas emissions into the agencys regulatory functions. to secure revenue for this purpose the baaqmd adopted a ghg fee paid by regulated industry which generates approximately $1 million annually. similarly no funds were appropriated or available to develop the scs pursuant to sb 375. to meet this mandate mtc allocated proposition 84 funds it received along with a considerable investment of its own funds. in addition a $5 million hud grant is funding planning that is being incorporated into the scs and abag has received over $2 million from the strategic growth council in proposition 84 funds to support scs work. abag also received $830000 from multiple sources for disaster preparedness planning. based on this experience it may seem reasonable to assume that the jpc agencies may be able to use their entrepreneurial effectiveness to secure the funds needed to underwrite the cost of formulating a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. however it should also be recognized that while the four agencies have been equal partners in advancing the objectives of the jpc they have not had equal access to financial resources to provide for the funding of jpc activities. for example mtc has borne the lions share of the cost of developing the scs. also mtc and the baaqmd fund the two jpc consultants while abag contributes office space and administrative support for the consultants. as a state agency bcdc has relatively little direct control over its budget and due to ongoing state budget constraints bcdc has only been able to provide in-kind staff work to support jpc activities. this unequal funding approach may not be sustainable over the long term and may eventually have to be replaced with a new funding model that relies on some combination of more equitable financial contributions from all four jpc partners and far more external grants or special funding to finance jpc activities. in light of this situation we believe the jpc should depart slightly from its adopted policies and procedures in deciding whether to take a leadership role in facilitating the formulation of a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. these procedures call for the jpc to first make a decision on whether to take on this leadership role and then for the agency staff to prepare a work plan for carrying out the leadership role. however given the potential fiscal magnitude of formulating a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy the agency staffs have prepared a preliminary work plan that identifies the costs and possible funding sources for preparing a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. we believe providing this work plan will assist the jpc in making a policy decision on its regional leadership role in sea level rise planning. this preliminary work plan (attachment b) was developed by the staffs of abag and bcdc in consultation with the staffs of the baaqmd and mtc and the jpcs consultants. it is appropriate for bcdc and abag to take on joint leadership in formulating both the work plan and the adaptation strategy because of bcdcs recognized role as a national leader in sea level rise adaptation planning and because of the critical responsibilities the local government members of abag will have in formulating and implementing a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. to advance the goal of having a single integrated plan bay area the primary thrust of the work plan is to fully integrate the regional sea level rise adaptation strategy into the sustainability communities strategy that is being formulated pursuant to sb 375. the work plan envisions a sea level rise strategy being pursued in three phases: (1) considering sea level rise exposure in the current scs and its environmental impact report using existing financial resources; (2) convening and supporting subregional and local planning adaptation planning efforts and incorporating lessons learned in the regions second scs; and (3) developing a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy that integrates tasks one and two and incorporates protection of regionally important environmental resources into the third scs. to augment the efforts of the jpc agencies the california state coastal conservancy should be actively engaged in formulating the regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. the coastal conservancy administers the san francisco bay area conservancy program which provides grants and staff assistance to improve public access to the bay; to protect restore and enhance natural habitats; and to assist in the implementation of the policies of the san francisco bay plan and the adopted plans of local governments and special districts. the conservancy also works in partnership with abag to administer the san francisco bay restoration authority which is empowered to levy a benefit assessment special tax or property-related fees to raise funds needed for wildlife habitat restoration related public access recreation and flood protection projects. since funding the implementation of a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy will be a critical issue in deciding which elements should be incorporated into the strategy it is imperative to engage an agency that has the authority to raise funds at the outset the strategy formulation process. in addition because the formulation of the strategy relies heavily on developing a working partnership with that local agencies that are responsible for flood protection the bay area flood protection agencies association (bafpaa) and the bay area water agencies coalition (bawac) should be engaged in the development of the sea level rise strategy from the outset. this can be accomplished by integrating the strategy into the bay area integrated regional water management plan (irwmp) which coordinates the work of bafpaa bawac and the many other organizations and agencies that deal with water management and habitat protection. the coastal conservancy plays a key role in the management of the irwmp. if the jpc decides a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy is needed and that the preliminary work plan for formulating such a strategy is reasonable if any of the funding needed to develop the strategy is to be provided by jpc member agencies the funding would have to be agreed upon by the regional agencies contributing funds. 5. is there likely to be a significant impact on achieving the mandated responsibilities of one of the regional agencies if the jpc does not take on a leadership role on the project or issue? diking filing land reclamation projects carried out between 1850 and 1960 reduced the size of san francisco bay by one-third. two-thirds of the remaining bay was shallow enough to reclaim. bcdc was established in 1965 to prevent this shrinking of the bay to continue and was empowered to deal with the problem by regulating new bay fill projects. in other words bcdc was created to prevent the bay from getting smaller. however sea level rise will make the bay larger a problem bcdc was not established to address and which it had no authority to control. ab 2094 (desaulnier) enacted in 2008 to add bcdc as a voting member of the jpc addressed this shortcoming by allowing bcdc to engage in the development of a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. specifically ab 2094 provides: the san francisco bay conservation and development commission in coordination with local governments regional councils of government and other agencies and interested parties may develop regional strategies as needed for addressing the impacts of and adapting to the effects of sea level rise and other impacts of global climate change on the san francisco bay and affected shoreline areas. these regional strategies may include but are not limited to the following: (a) identification of areas that may be subject to erosion inundation or other impacts from sea level rise and climate change. (b) economic and environmental analyses of the benefits and costs of protecting the areas likely to be impacted. thus there would be a significant impact on bcdc in carrying out this provision of law if the jpc does not take on a leadership role in the formulation of a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. there are multiple local state federal and regional government agencies with authority over the bay and shoreline. the local governments that are members of abag have broad authority over shoreline land use within their boundaries but no authority over the actions of adjacent jurisdictions and the decisions of state and federal agencies. local governments also have limited resources to address climate change adaptation. coordinating adaptation strategies among the agencies involved and securing financial support to plan and implement these strategies will have to be a key component of an effective regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. therefore there will be a significant impact on the mandated responsibilities of the local government members of abag if such a regional strategy is not undertaken. the shoreline of the bay is largely surrounded by transportation infrastructure including freeways highways railroads ports and airports. as a result these transportation linkages will be the first to experience the flooding impacts caused by climate change induced sea level rise and storms. disruptions in mobility will have impacts region-wide far beyond the areas flooded. therefore the formulation of a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy facilitated by the jpc will impact mtc transportation facility owners and operators and local congestion management agencies in fulfilling their mandated responsibilities. conclusion and recommendation. it is appropriate for the jpc to take on a leadership role in facilitating the formulation of a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy as requested by bcdc. jpc should fulfill this facilitation role through its responsibilities for regional leadership (i.e. by providing regional leadership and advocacy of the critical regional economic and environmental importance of having an effective sea level rise adaptation strategy) and for regional agency coordination (i.e. by exercising its authority to coordinate the regional agencies and to resolve any conflicts that arise in the development a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy and its integration into the scs). to optimize scarce resources and create the flexibility needed to plan amidst a high degree of uncertainty it is essential that a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy be developed collaboratively with local governments and especially local agencies with responsibility for flood protection. moreover retrofitting the bay areas transportation infrastructure system to be resilient to flooding will be extraordinarily expensive. however the potential exists that the process of providing flood protection for transportation facilities can also provide flood protection for low-lying area inland of the transportation facilities along the shoreline. the jpc provides a framework for coordinating the planning and policy development of its four member agencies and local governments; for advancing consistent and effective regional decision-making to address climate change; and for providing local governments with assistance and incentives for addressing climate change. to take advantage of these opportunities the jpc can play a critically important role in facilitating the formulation of a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. ","sea level rise from global warming is a fact. water levels in san francisco bay have risen nearly eight inches over the past century and scientists agree that the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. while exact future increases in sea level rise are uncertain the state of california has adopted guidance for state agencies which indicates that bay may rise 10 to 17 inches by 2050 17 to 32 inches by 2070 and 31 to 69 inches by the end of the century. sea level rise is a particularly acute problem for the bay area because 240 square miles of shoreline land was reclaimed from the bay by filling it just high enough to be above past sea level but not above future sea level. also because of land subsidence parts of the south bay where a number of high-profile silicon valley companies are located are below current sea level. approximately 330 square miles of low-lying land around the bay may be vulnerable to sea level rise over the next century. numerous critical regional assets are located within these areas vulnerable to flooding. some of these assets include san franciscos financial district mission bay treasure island san francisco international airport oakland international airport the headquarters of a number of silicon valley companies highways railroads and communities. in addition to determining how best to protect existing economic assets the bay area needs a cohesive strategy for increasing job growth and enhancing economic prosperity in the decades ahead. to achieve these goals it will be necessary to continue to attract private investment capital to the bay region. if investors are concerned about the long-term economic viability of development located in areas vulnerable to flooding or if underwriters will not insure such development the bay area will be at a distinct competitive disadvantage in securing this needed investment capital. therefore a regional strategy for addressing sea level rise adaptation is critical to the regions continued economic prosperity.

","context: the martinez adult school campus borders alhambra creek for about 620 linear ft. in the lower watershed floodplain. this part of the creek is still subject to periodic flooding even after the creek channel was widened in 2005 to increase flow capacity. in january of 2006 overflows of alhambra creek caused approximately one million dollars in damage to this school property. the possibility of housing developments upstream in the middle watershed would bring increased impervious surface that could intensify future flooding at this downstream site. in april of 2012 the martinez unified school district(musd)board of education voted to spend 5.2 million dollars to contruct new campus buildings at this site. as of 9/2012 preliminary concepts and designs are being developed for musd board consideration to see how far that $5.2m can stretch. this is the ideal time to develop and integrate flood protection lid measures and riparian corridor restoration into the overall building design for the new campus. routing floodwaters through bioswales between the buildings out to the parking area/detention basin could protect this major investment in new construction. the current parking area covers 1.4 acres with an adjacent .5 acre paved lot. converting this areaand possibly pedestrian walkways to pervious surface could yield between 1.4 to 2 acres of infiltration surface. during the creek channel widening in 2005 native trout were discovered in the creek at this site. it was theorized that cooler water from groundwater seepage into the creek was creating preferable temperature conditions at this location that attracted the trout. adding a large infiltration area could only improve conditions. the alhambra watershed council has offered to assist in developing ways to organically integrate the creek and an expanded riparian buffer zone into the campus design so that it can become an educational resource and community asset while simultaneously increasing flood protection and improving water quality in the creek. one aspect of this integration would be the self-guided nature trail along the edge of the riparian zone for the 620 feet of school property. this would be developed by the award-winning environmentally focused high school program \"the new leaf collaborative for sustainable living\" that has been housed at this campus since 2005.

","the san francisco bay has lost an estimated 80 to 90 percent of its historic wetlands to fill or alteration and very little high-quality tidal salt marsh habitat remains in the south bay. a large proportion of the remaining undeveloped land is comprised of salt production ponds which have been a dominant component of the south bay landscape for over a century and support a suite of waterbirds that has become adapted to their presence. the 2003 acquisition of the sbsp restoration project area provided land managers with an opportunity to reverse the dramatic decline in populations of marsh-dependent fish and wildlife by restoring significant amounts of tidal wetlands. in addition many bay-side communities are at risk from tidal and fluvial flooding. restoration of tidal marshes in conjunction with new flood protection infrastructure can provide a more sustainable approach to protecting these communities in the face of sea-level rise. a third goal of south bay salt pond restoration project is to provide public access to restored areas which are centrally located to the majority of the bay areas 7.5 million inhabitants. ","possible without project consequences include increased vulnerability to tidal flooding of south bay communities and continued decline of endangered species dependent upon tidal marsh habitat.

","if the proposal is not implemented school facility design and managment will likely remain as it currently exists. opportunities for integrating innovative water conservation and stormwater management improvements will be limited to schools with internal and external environmental champions. this may result in a number of exceptional projects but likely more opportunities will be missed even as school districts appeal to voters for facility improvements through bond measures. potable water will continue to be used for non-potable uses which will further strain water supplies and reliability. polluted runoff will continue to wash off school grounds into pipes that lead to local waterbodies. ","three schools will be outfitted with large-volume cisterns for rain water capture and reuse. the sizing of the cisterns will be based on each site's specific non-potable water use budget (total water needs for toilet flushing and outdoor irrigation). there may be ancillary groundwater recharge benefits associated with lid stormwater treatment measures. lid measures at each site will provide natural treatment of urban runoff by filtering and breaking down pollutants. bioretention measures have been shown to effectively reduce common stormwater contaminents such as heavy metals polyaromatic hydrocarbons and suspended sediments. both the lid stromwater treatment measures and rain water catchment systems will reduce stormwater runoff volumes and velocities which will reduce localized flooding risks. the lid stormwater treatment measures will create green spaces on school campuses which can attract local wildlife and provide stewardship and educational opportunities at each site.

related to a disadvantaged community: flood hazard reduction projects and lid program in which dac benefits are prioritized ","the sonoma valley integrated water management program is an inter-related suite of initiatives that will address flood hazard reduction water supply water quality habitat and ecosystem function and climate change resilience goals within the sonoma valley. a primary impetus for this effort was the development of the sonoma valley groundwater management plan (gwmp) a voluntary non-regulatory plan that identifies actions needed to develop sustainable groundwater supplies in the sonoma valley. in addition the december 31 2005 flood of record in the sonoma creek basin was a catalyst in heightening local awareness of existing flood hazards and the need to develop a reliable foundation for land use and flood management planning as several million dollars worth of damage was incurred including $2.4 million in the city of sonoma. this program identifies a set of specific multi-objective projects (city of sonoma adobe canyon) as well as program components to address flood hazards within sonoma valley. both the gwmp and the flood event were influential in triggering the development of the sonoma valley stormwater management and groundwater recharge study (2012) an effort by the sonoma county water agency (scwa) that prompted the development of this program and many of its specific project elements. most of the sonoma creek watershed is designated as critical habitat for central coast steelhead (noaa) and is listed as water quality-impaired for sediment (rwqcb). the opportunities to enhance sonoma creek and its tributaries so as to make real differences for water quality and this federally-listed threatened species are tremendous in this relatively rural watershed tributary to san francisco bay. public access and education will be integrated into many of the component projects. the off-line surface water basins for combined flood detention and groundwater recharge that are located on public and park open space lands will include public access and interpretive features. the rural and urban lands stormwater management programs are explicitly focused on public education through demonstration projects workshops and development of educational and technical support materials. other projects such as the stuart run fish passage barrier removal include development of a new small park with ample opportunity to explain the role of the project in the recovery of the central coast steelhead and educate visitors on the status of steelhead in the watershed and the challenges faced by this iconic native fish. any land or easement acquisition required for implementation of specific projects undertaken as part of this program will be undertaken with willing sellers only. program components include the following: flood hazard reduction  development and implementation of flood management projects with a priority on projects

buffering lid and community engagement in a dac: sec sonoma county regional parks ","over the past 30 years the sonoma valley has experienced rapid population growth and landuse changes. with population growth flood risks have increased as people have developed and moved into floodplains increasing runoff and creating hydraulic constraints in stream channels (e.g. bridges). with development has come significant impacts to native species habitat and to the water quality of the creeks draining the sonoma valley. additional problems include groundwater aquifer decline flooding and sedimentation resulting from changes to runoff patterns dependence on water imported from the russian river and severe declines in riparian forest anadromous steelhead and salmon and other aquatic-dependent species and habitats. the effects of climate change and the threat of a rise in sea level would compound existing problems. people in sonoma valley are highly concerned about water supply and water quality but generally they do not realize how their everyday actions affect water conditions.. there has been a significant increase in irrigated agriculture predominantly vineyards which rely heavily on groundwater. groundwater levels have declined in some portions of the sonoma valley due to increased localized groundwater withdrawals. cones of depression have developed in areas southeast of the city of sonoma and southwest of el verano. a study by the usgs (2006) showed a moderate but persistent average annual net loss in aquifer storage in recent decades on the order of 1000 af. declines in groundwater level may result in increased extraction costs possible well deepening or replacements costs possible groundwater quality degradation including salinity intrusion potential land subsidence decreases in streamflow and environmental damage. climate change is expected to lead to greater variability in precipitation levels and a possible shortening of the precipitation season. as a result the need for an effective conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater systems will grow. the sonoma valley integrated water management program will provide both flood hazard reduction and groundwater recharge benefits. it will enhance water supply water quality and habitat in the sonoma valley while promoting resilience to climate change. ","if the proposed sonoma valley integrated water management program is not implemented flooding will worsen and cause damage even during small storms groundwater levels will continue to decline at their present rate impaired water quality will persist and the city of sonomas municipal water supply well will continue to deteriorate becoming less reliable. the threatened central coast steelhead population will continue to be unable to access identified critical habitat in the sonoma creek watershed and waterways will become increasingly vulnerable to wastewater discharges resulting from damaged sewer pipelines. declining groundwater levels will cause impacts to the local community and to the environment. the cost to extract groundwater will increase as groundwater levels decline. wells will need to be drilled deeper into the aquifer or replaced entirely. groundwater quality will also decline evidenced by salinity intrusion decreases in streamflow and environmental ","combined flood detention and groundwater recharge facilities which will capture and detain/retain storm water surface runoff and storm drain diversion will enhance infiltration to the groundwater aquifer. groundwater recharge will be promoted in a manner to maximize passive infiltration to the deep zone aquifer  offsetting in some measure the effects of a declining groundwater table and saline intrusion migrating up-valley from the san pablo bay. replacing and relocating the old city of sonoma well will improve the reliability of the local municipal water supply and proactively respond to the effects of saline groundwater intrusion within the city watersheds. improvements to the stormwater management systems will enhance natural recharge including restoration of flow from a spring that has been diverted into the stormdrain system in the city of sonoma. enhanced recharge from storage facilities and stormwater system retrofits will help to increase groundwater storage and/or reduce reliance on imported water. water quality enhancements will occur under the sonoma valley integrated water management program through groundwater recharge projects promotion of improved stormwater management techniques on urban and rural lands reduction of sediment source supply to watershed drainages (e.g. through channel stabilization replacement of a bridge in sugarloaf state park that promotes severe scour and through treatment of severe upslope erosion sites). the groundwater recharge promoted by detention facilities will be designed to maximize passive infiltration to the deep zone aquifer offsetting in some measure the effects of a declining groundwater table and saline intrusion migrating up-valley from the san pablo bay. stormwater management programs to demonstrate promote and support water management techniques to reduce or eliminate hydromodification effects of development on both urban and rural lands will also enhance water quality. the protection of sewer stream crossings will minimize the environmental and public health hazards of raw sewage spills. the sonoma valley integrated water management program includes a program element specifically directed towards flood hazard analysis and flood management project development and implementation. the outdated and piecemeal floodplain studies for sonoma creek and its tributaries will be replaced by coherent analyses and subsequent project designs based on current data and a more integrative and multi-objective approach to flood management planning. measures to be implemented in the city of sonoma will reduce flood hazards along fryer and nathanson creeks. the combined flood detention and groundwater recharge facilities will capture and detain/retain direct stormwater surface runoff and stormdrain diversion. replacement of the existing fryer creek culvert crossing beneath macarthur avenue in the city of sonoma will increase conveyance and work in combination with the detention/recharge basins to provide 10- year flood protection to most of the drainage and incremental benefits to the nathanson creek drainage. the floodplain restoration project on lower fryer and lower nathanson creeks will reduce flood elevations upstream improving the effectiveness of upstream detention projects. lastly modifications to the stormdrain system will reduce the effects of undersized infrastructure and enhance infiltration opportunities thereby further reducing flood hazards. combined detention/recharge facilities in the upper sonoma creek watershed will reduce flood peaks downstream along the creek. the adobe canyon project will use a combination of sediment removal channel modification and other measures to reduce flood damages at the outlet of adobe canyon in kenwood. stream maintenance activities will improve flood conveyance by removing invasive plants addressing sediment deposits that create problematic flow constrictions while preserving habitat complexity and selectively pruning or removing vegetation that blocks the active flow area of the channel. tidal marsh restoration will reduce flood hazards by changing land uses to those that are compatible with flooding and will provide a buffer to the flooding and erosion hazards associated with sea level rise. most of the components of the proposed sonoma valley integrated water management program will integrate one or more aspects of resource stewardship. the program as a whole is a set of activities directed towards watershed management. the off-line detention/recharge basins will largely be sited on public lands including parks and athletic fields. these projects will provide tangible opportunities for the community to learn first-hand about watershed management. habitat protection and restoration are part of the stream maintenance practices including the removal of invasive plant species and revegetation with native species. enhancement of groundwater recharge through stormwater management and the focused recharge facilities will enhance the delivery of groundwater to stream channels and promote a more natural flood flow hydrograph in sonoma creek (e.g. extended receding limb of the hydrograph). removal of fish passage barriers and restoration of stream channels and tidal wetlands will directly provide habitat benefits for listed and other species. tidal wetlands restoration will also provide carbon sequestration as marsh vegetation develops and becomes buried in sediments with the anticipated rise in sea level.

","drinking water supply: this project will add between 800 to 1200 afy of new potable supply to the city. this will increase and diversify the supply available to the city including during droughts. furthermore the addition of two wells to the city will: (1) provide the city with effective emergency storage (of which it currently has none); (2) provide the city with an alternate potable supply source when there are supply interruptions or water quality breaches on the san francisco public utilities commission (sfpuc) regional system (e.g. as occurred on march 3 2015); and (3) increase system pressures to meet fire flow requirements in the dac portions of the city where there are currently insufficient fire flows and system pressures that are regularly as low as 20 psi. water quality improvement: the treatment systems that will be developed to treat the produced groundwater at the new well and the gloria way well will ensure that the groundwater that enters the city's water distribution system meets all primary and secondary mcls. furthermore the addition of these two wells will ensure that the city has an alternate source of potable supply to rely on when water quality breaches occur on the sfpuc regional system (e.g. as occurred on march 3 2015). groundwater benefits: as part of this project the city is working with other basin users to develop a groundwater management plan (gwmp) that will ensure the long-term sustainability of the san mateo plain groundwater subbasin. ","description: this project includes the development of groundwater as a new supply source for the city through the design and construction of: (1) a new well and treatment system; and (2) a treatment system at the citys currently-inactive gloria way well. this project will result in 800 to 1200 afy of new supply to the city and will address major public health and safety and economic issues that have local and regional impacts. benefits to a dac: this project will develop local groundwater for conjunctive use to increase public safety improve emergency preparedness provide drought relief and increase water supply reliability within the dac portion of the city. every census tract within the city is considered a dac and 79% of the residents are low-income. readiness to proceed: as part of its work to construct a new well and treatment system the city conducted a 2012 groundwater feasibility study and constructed a pilot well conducted aquifer pump testing and collected soil and groundwater samples in 2014. design of the well and treatment system will be completed by april 2016 with construction completed by july 2017. the gloria way well was constructed in 1981. use of the well ceased shortly thereafter due to elevated concentrations of manganese in the produced water. the city completed a series of studies (2012 groundwater feasibility study and an approved 2013 ceqa/nepa document) that identify the benefits of bringing the gloria way well back on-line with the addition of a treatment system. design of the treatment system will be completed by june 2015 with construction completed by september 2016. function/physical benefits: this project provides a supplemental supply source that will make the city more resilient during droughts provide for economic growth and create a buffer against impacts from cutbacks outages and water quality incidents on the sfpuc regional system. such an incident occurred on march 3 2015 wherein untreated water was introduced into the sfpuc regional system. due to lack of system storage or alternative supplies the city was forced to provide untreated water to customers. in this instance no public health issues were noted; however a more catastrophic incident would result in a public health crisis. further the location of the wells in the citys distribution system will add water and boost system pressures to the dac portions of the city that currently are plagued by low pressures (i.e. regularly as low as 20 psi) and where adequate fire flow cannot be provided creating a public health and safety risk. coordination/collaboration: the city is developing this project with support from agencies and stakeholders including the bay area water supply and conservation agency (bawsca) santa clara valley water district alameda county water district sfpuc san mateo county palo alto menlo park foster city town of atherton tuolomne river trust palo alto park mutual water company and o'conner tract co-op water company. the city is committed to working with stakeholders to effectively manage and protect the groundwater basin. the citys gwmp will be completed by december 2015. ","as is described in more detail below the city has multiple water supply needs that will be addressed by this project: the city has one of the lowest residential per capita water uses in the state (51 r gpcd) which makes drought cutbacks difficult to achieve; the city uses more than its contractual allocation from the sfpuc regional system which means that it cannot support any additional economic development; the city has a single source of supply and no emergency storage which makes it vulnerable to supply interruptions and water quality breaches; and the city cannot currently meet fire flow requirements in large portions of dac neighborhoods within the city which creates a major public health and safety issue. water supply need: the city has a single source of water  a supply allocation of 1.94 million gallons per day (mgd) that it has from the sfpuc regional system which is relied upon by 26 other agencies. the citys current demand meets or exceed its supply allocation which means that it cannot approve any additional economic development. furthermore due to the current drought conditions the sfpuc regional system supply is constrained and deliveries from this system could be reduced by as much as 20% during future dry years. based on the projections in the city's current urban water management plan (uwmp) the city's normal year supply deficit will be 1200 afy by 2030; drought shortfalls will be even greater. this project will increase the citys water supply by 800 to 1200 afy and thus will augment the citys water supply portfolio in both normal and dry years. drought relief need: currently the citys customers use approximately 51 r-gpcd which means that during a significant drought and cutbacks to its sfpuc regional system supply they have limited ability to reduce their consumption. this project will provide the city with a supplemental source of supply which will create a buffer for the city during droughts such as the one that we are currently experiencing. further since the city will have an alternative supply that it can rely on during normal and drought years this project will reduce the citys reliance on the sfpuc regional system which benefits the region and the delta. water quality need: the city currently does not have any storage tanks or alternative supplies that can provide a source of treated water during emergencies or other supply disruptions which makes the city and its customers extremely vulnerable. for example on march 3 2015 the sfpuc released untreated water to the regional system which the city had no choice but to serve to its customers. this project will provide the city and its customers with an alternative source of high-quality potable water that is can use during emergencies and other supply interruptions. public health and safety need: in large portions of the city and particularly in the dac portions of the city system pressures are routinely as low as 20 psi. this means that if there were to be a fire or other emergency the city would not be able to provide sufficient fire flow to address the emergency situation. this creates a major public health and safety issue for the city its customers and the region. this project will add additional water supply points near the dac neighborhoods that could address a number of these issues by augmenting supply and maintaining system pressure in that area during peak demand periods or in the event of a fire. economic need: every census tract within the city is considered a dac and 79% of the residents are considered low-income. the current unemployment rate is 10.1% according to the california employment development departments october 2014 report which is much greater than the county-wide unemployment rate of 4.1% and the states average of 7%. the current cost to purchase water from the sfpuc regional system is $1900 per acre-foot. in contrast the cost for the city to produce groundwater is approximately $400 per acre-foot. over a 20-year period development of groundwater will save the city $36000000. by lowering the cost of the citys water supply this project will greatly benefit the citys customers especially those in the dac neighborhoods. further additional supply will allow the city to approve additional economic development within the city which has millions of dollars of local and regional benefits. ","water supply impact: without an additional supply source the city will have to either: (1) purchase water from the sfpuc regional system in volumes above its contractual entitlement or (2) cease economic development. both scenarios create significant impacts locally and regionally. this project will add 800 to 1200 afy of additional supply to support economic development within the city and the region. drought impact: the city is currently 100% dependent upon the sfpuc regional system which can reduce deliveries by over 20% during dry years creating a supply shortfall for the city of over 700 afy. the city has limited ability to conserve during a drought without significant economic hardship due to its already low residential water use (51 r-gpcd). this project will add additional supply of 800 to 1200 afy that would provide drought relief. water quality impact: the city lacks significant water reliability and security in the event of a water quality event on the sfpuc regional system. for example on march 3 2015 the sfpuc released untreated water to the regional system which the city had no choice but to serve to its customers. this project will provide the city with an alternative source of water that it can use during emergencies and other supply interruptions. public health and safety impact: the citys distribution system lacks sufficient storage and redundancy to provide a secure water supply to major portions of the city during an emergency and is unreliable during peak demand periods (i.e. system pressures are routinely as low as 20 psi in the dac portion of the city). without this project the city will remain extremely vulnerable to fire and emergency situations. this creates a major public health and safety issue for the city and the region. this project will add additional water supply points near the dac neighborhoods that addresses these issues by augmenting supply and maintaining system pressures during peak demand periods or in the event of an emergency. economic impact: this project provides a highly-reliable and cost-effective source of water to the city and its dac customers. without this project the city will be forced to purchase additional water from the sfpuc regional system at a cost of at least $1900 per acre-foot rather than developing groundwater at a cost of $400 per acre-foot. over a 20-year period development of groundwater will save the city $36000000. furthermore without this project the city does not have sufficient water supply to support further economic development within the city to great economic impact - locally and regionally. ","by adding additional local and drought-proof supply sources this project achieves the following immediate benefits that are consistent with state and regional priorities: immediate drought preparedness and increases local water supply reliability and the delivery of safe drinking water. the project will provide an additional 800 to 1200 afy of new water supply to the city and by extension the region during normal and drought years. it will allow the city to reduce the amount of water it purchases from the sfpuc system and instead will allow the city to cost-effectively produce its own water. further because this project will develop new supplies for the city it will provide for future economic growth with significant economic benefits locally and to the region.increases local water supply reliability and the delivery of safe drinking water. the project will provide 800 to 1200 afy of emergency treated water supply for the city. currently the city has no emergency water supplies available in the event of a shutdown of the sfpuc regional system or water quality incident such as the recent march 3 2015 incident. additionally the low pressures that are routinely observed in the citys distribution system are a potential fire control hazard particularly in the high-density dac housing areas. this project could help to avoid the immeasurable cost of public health impacts and loss of property caused by a future incident or emergency.groundwater management. through the development and implementation of its cwc 10753- compliant groundwater management plan the city will continue to work with other basin users to manage the san mateo plain groundwater sub-basin. the city also supports basin compliance with the casgem program.improvement of water quality. by adding groundwater treatment systems the city will be able to tap into an underutilized resource and distribute 800 to 1200 afy of high-quality water to its customers during normal conditions as well as during a water quality breaches on the sfpuc regional system.groundwater recharge/surface storage: in lieu of developing surface water storage this project conjunctively uses groundwater as a source of underground storage that is available to the city during emergencies and drought years. reduced use of groundwater during wet years will allow the basin to recharge such that groundwater is available to augment the citys supply during drought years support summer peaking demands and provide water in the event of an emergency.

","san mateo county ","37.4748815000 -122.4479538200 "," the project will begin as soon as funding is secured. ","the project will complete within 36 months of beginning. ","the road improvement projects are located on five sections of roads in upper pilarcitos creek nuff creek apanolio creek and mills creek watersheds. the water budget development project will extend to the entire pilarcitos creek watershed and its tributaries. ","improving rural roads will reduce sediment inputs and stormwater runoff rates resulting in 1) reduced stormwater flows in streams and contributions to the risk of floods 2) an increase in infiltration which will improve groundwater flows 3) improved water quality and aquatic habitat and (4) the prolonged input of groundwater to stream networks in dry periods thereby enhancing instream flow. a detailed water budget allows managers and stakeholders to quantify and identify the sources and uses of water throughout the watershed. it will help identify prioritize and forecast responses to various proposed projects in the watershed. ","the rcd completed assessments of over 23 miles of roads on public and private lands a significant majority of the watershed and completed implementation-ready designs for approximately 5 miles of roads deemed to be highest priorities in the assessments. the proposed treatments follow guidelines described in dfgs california salmonid stream habitat restoration manual. they include properly sized culverts trash racks armored water crossings rock armor rolling and critical road drainage dips outsloping road segments to disperse sheet flow and inslope roads when necessary rock road surfaces to reduce sheet erosion and sediment basins to collect surface drainage and diffuse find sediment transportation. this project would implement approximately 3.5 miles of treatments resulting in an estimated reduction of 4058 yds3 of sediment delivery. the rcd will work with coastside county water district san francisco public utilities commission and the pilarcitos restoration workgroup to address a number of large data gaps that add significant uncertainty to the existing water budget. this project component will compile and analyze available information in addition to collecting additional field data when necessary. it will estimate diversions from pilarcitos reservoir by sfpuc review existing long-term usgs gage data develop a surface water hydrologic model integrate surface and subsurface models estimate private diversions determine perennial flow distribution for dry years and provide data to help evaluate the volume of water necessary to maintain an open estuary for steelhead migration. a model will allow analysis of various different test scenarios to help identify the potential benefits and impacts associated with various management strategies. ","one of the key limiting factors in identifying and evaluating water supply improvements is considerable uncertainty about the water budget for the pilarcitos watershed. several of the components for such an understanding are missing. a detailed water budget allows managers and stakeholders to quantify and identify the sources and uses of water throughout the watershed guide selection of project priorities identify potential problem areas and forecast response to various proposed projects. a well-maintained water budget will also allow water supply agencies to better coordinate responses to demand needs and will support the development of improved monitoring and adaptive management tools. erosion from rural roads contributed excess sediment that degrades fish spawning and rearing habitat and impairs bank stability and the streams ability to carry floodwaters. noaas 2007 federal recovery plan for central california coast steelhead identifies the need to improve rural roads. roads also tend to have significant hydrologic effects  by routing runoff to streams rapidly peak streamflows are increased exacerbating in-stream erosion and less water can infiltrate soil thereby decreasing dry season base flows and water availability for diverse beneficial uses. both components of this project were identified as tier 1 or highest priority actions in the iwmp. ","without road improvements surface hydrology related to roads will not be normalized chronic delivery of sediment will continue water quality will worsen (among other impacts water quality is a potential limiting factor for estuary rearing of steelhead) steelhead rearing habitat will be lost through pool filling and channel and estuary aggradation. these impacts are related to chronic sediment delivery. absent road improvements the risk of catastrophic failures of stream crossings and road fill is also much greater.without an adequate water budget managers of water in the watershed will be unable to evaluate less likely to identify and less likely or able to implement improvements to water supply. ","water budget project: a detailed water budget allows managers and stakeholders to quantify and identify the sources and uses of water throughout the watershed. it will provide objective numerical data to guide selection of project priorities identify potential problem areas and forecast response to various proposed projects. a well-maintained water budget will also allow water supply agencies to better coordinate responses to demand needs and will support the development of improved monitoring and adaptive management tools. additionally detailed hydrologic measurements or modeling of subwatersheds will improve our understanding of annual flows storm response and baseflow conditions especially if this model can be calibrated to existing flow information. a model will allow analysis of various different test scenarios to help identify the potential benefits and impacts associated with various strategies. understanding the interaction between stream conditions and subsurface withdrawals will help establish sustainable limits to groundwater use improved management strategies for groundwater pumping given instream flow effects and can help improve groundwater storage and conjunctive use strategies. improved estimates of actual (versus permitted) water rights diversions will help to estimate the losses (reductions) associated with diversions as opposed to all other loss mechanisms. in addition to evaluating permitted water rights an estimate of private well usage in the watershed on a monthly and annual basis would augment the water balance and help to determine the cumulative level of impact from private well usage. a detailed accounting of water diversions from pilarcitos reservoir to other facilities operated by sfpuc (e.g. crystal springs reservoir) is in progress. this fundamental data will help identify strategies for more efficient water transfers and maintenance of instream flows for pilarcitos creek. previous monitoring studies for several of the subwatersheds collected streamflow data at 15-minute intervals. however the published reports only provide summary results that limit our ability to evaluate more detailed subwatershed response patterns. compiling and integrating this data into a watershed-scale hydrologic analysis could help inform the rainfall-runoff transformation and baseflow conditions for these tributaries which could help establish operational strategies for managing flow releases below pilarcitos lake and stone dam. road project:pacific watershed associates inc. (pwa) has prepared the implementation plan (plan 1) for road related sediment reduction in the pilarcitos creek watershed [4.] plan 1 is based on sediment source assessment data collected and analyzed by pwa between 2008 and 2011 [4 5]. the 2009 report summarized the field assessment of approximately 9.8 mi of roads and 42 sediment delivery sites in the apanolio creek and mills creek subwatersheds of pilarcitos creek. the 2011 report evaluated an additional ~ 2.6 mi of roads and 9 sediment delivery sites in the upper watershed area of pilarcitos creek. this sediment reduction plan recommends treatment of selected sediment delivery sites from the 2009 assessment and all sites from the 2011 upper pilarcitos creek road assessment. plan 1 provides the treatment prescriptions (including road logs maps and typical drawings) required to implement erosion control and erosion prevention treatments along 5 road reaches in the pilarcitos creek watershed that were identified as top priority for treatment by pwa the smcrcd and high interest level of landowners. the roads reviewed for this sediment reduction plan total approximately 5.4 mi and include 36 sediment delivery sites and approximately 3.45 mi of hydrologically connected road segments. estimated reduction in future sediment delivery if all components of the plan are implemented to specifications totals 4058 cubic yards. the expected benefit of completing the erosion control and erosion prevention treatments recommended in this report lies in the reduction of long-term sediment delivery to the pilarcitos creek watershed which contains important habitat for steelhead production in coastal california. roads are typically one of the largest sources of fine sediment pollution. erosion from cut-slopes and bare road surfaces is easily routed to the road drainage system which is often connected to the stream environment during large storms. road drainage systems can destabilize roads fill-slopes causing landslides. hydrologic effects from road can also have significant impacts to both peak flows and baseflows. several anecdotal citations and consulting team observations of road problems were noted during the watershed assessment update process.

","information on historical stream flow and groundwater levels can be used to improve management of drinking water supplies. historical information on wetland distribution can inform planning for wetland restoration and associated water quality improvement. the project will provide a framework for effective watershed-scale lid and related runoff reduction efforts. the project will identify opportunities for strategic floodplain restoration and groundwater recharge. historical information will be used in prioritizing restoration efforts and maximizing the resilience of restored landscapes. findings will aid in identifying locations conducive to natural flood protection strategies such as wetland restoration. the project will identify opportunities to increase green spaces and restore natural landscapes in disadvantaged communities particularly in low-lying floodprone settings at the bay margin. work in marin and sonoma counties will be carried out in collaboration with the federally-recognized federated indians of graton rancheria with whom we are collaborating on historical ecology studies within their aboriginal bay area territory. ","this project will synthesize results from both completed and planned studies of historical watershed conditions and functioning in the bay area to create integrated tools for sustainable watershed management in the region. the project team will evaluate previously-completed studies to identify data gaps (in terms of climate zones watershed sizes and land use trajectories) and select additional watersheds for intensive study based on regional data needs and local interest/application. targeted local projects will likely include the walnut creek historical ecology study (in collaboration with the contra costa county flood control and water conservation district) the novato creek historical ecology study (in collaboration with the marin county flood control and water conservation district) and others to be determined. the project will then synthesize comparative information across watersheds to identify appropriate local management and restoration strategies based on watershed characteristics and land use trajectories. the watershed management tools developed through the project will include conceptual models of watershed functioning basemaps showing historical watershed conditions and a suite of site-specific restoration and adaption strategies addressing natural flood protection ecosystem restoration and water supply management. these products will be compiled into a toolbox for public dissemination and use including well-illustrated accessible reports gis/data files and a website. ","in future decades conflicts between flood protection water supply water quality and ecosystem health are expected to intensify as population growth climate change non-native species invasions and other stressors place increasing demands on aquatic ecosystems around the bay area. satisfying these competing demands  by sustaining and enhancing the full range of watershed functions  will require innovative management strategies that recognize how local watershed functions were distributed and expressed under more natural conditions (i.e. prior to significant euro-american modification). recent studies by the san francisco estuary institute (sfei) in collaboration with a number of local agencies have produced a wealth of practical historical ecology information to inform water management strategies for bay area watersheds including information on the heterogeneous distribution of intermittent and perennial stream reaches natural stream morphology types and high versus low groundwater areas. for example sfeis historical ecology studies have helped in identifying locations for sustainable wetland restoration for flood attenuation and storage developing approaches for natural flood protection through the reestablishment of strategic floodplain features and setting appropriate streamflow targets. historical ecology information has also been important for correcting misunderstandings about local ecosystems such as assumptions about perennial water conditions in our semi-arid region. given that many of our streams and other habitats were adapted to relatively dry conditions historical ecology information can help in prioritizing the use of scarce water resources and improving the resilience of the bay area environment to likely drought conditions in the future. ","historical ecology tools provided by this regional synthesis will help to avert a range of negative impacts that may arise from short-sighted management and restoration approaches. without information about the distribution of historical habitats and the natural expression of watershed functions important opportunities and constraints for restoration and resource management will not be identified and limited funding for restoration flood protection and other projects will be allocated less efficiently. conflicts between flood protection water supply and ecosystem health will likely intensify and aquatic systems will remain less resilient to climate change and other stressors. opportunities to restore strategic floodplain features and increase groundwater recharge will go unexploited. ","building upon existing projects this regional effort will fill data gaps in target watersheds and synthesize information across the region to develop a locally-specific framework of natural watershed functioning. products from the project will include conceptual models maps and other tools to enable local agencies to adopt more effective and sustainable watershed management strategies leading to benefits in water supply water quality flood management and ecosystem health. equally important the historical ecology approach helps develop a shared perspective about watershed history and potential future scenarios increasing public support for well-designed management actions. the project will create a regional basemap showing the distribution of historically perennial and intermittent stream reaches as well as conceptual models and hydrographs showing stream flow peaks summer flow groundwater recharge and groundwater levels over time. these tools will help in identifying strategic adjustments in water transport floodplain protection groundwater recharge and flow releases that can meet the water needs of local communities while sustaining ecosystem functions. using this information stream augmentation flows can be prioritized to areas with appropriate hydrogeomorphology and hydrographs can be adjusted to maximize the efficient use of local water supplies and decrease reliance on bay/delta water sources. similarly documenting the natural distribution of perennial versus seasonal wetlands throughout the region will identify the few critical places where topography soils and groundwater relationships will be likely to sustain wetlands in the future. wetlands provide important habitat mitigate flood damage and also play a key role in regulating water quality through n/p reduction and other functions. information about historical wetland characteristics and locations will inform efforts to design and restore healthy wetlands to achieve ecosystem water quality and flood management objectives. as communities increasingly desire integrative approaches to flood protection that also provide aesthetic and ecosystem functions a historical understanding of local stream morphology and history will support the next generation of natural flood protection design. for example re-integrating native tree cover and naturally distributed surface water storage/recharge functions based on historical analogues will maximize the local retention of water resources and reduction of downstream flood peaks. lastly understanding the ecosystem characteristics of the more drought-tolerant riparian corridor types -- which are not well represented today but were more common under past climates -- will help design less water-dependent more climate change resilient systems.

","the bay-friendly coalition is proposing that the bay-friendly rated landscapes program be identified in the bay area irwmp as a voluntary third-party verified standard that public and private property owners can use to guide the design construction and maintenance of their green infrastructure projects in order to maximize benefits to the watershed. the coalition proposes to collaborate with government agencies nongovernmental organizations and property developers who are submitting green infrastructure/lid projects to the bay area irwmp. green infrastructure/lid is a proven approach to conserving stormwater onsite increasing groundwater recharge minimizing urban runoff to local waterways and reducing flooding risks and damage. while not yet the norm in our region green infrastructure is becoming an increasingly common practice when public and private landscapes are built or renovated. however not all approaches to green infrastructure maximize a sites potential benefits to water supply and quality watershed health and function and environmental resource protection. the bay-friendly rated landscapes system can help ensure that lid projects meet a comprehensive technically rigorous standard for watershed protection. this project will provide bay area city and county agencies and private sector developers with resources and standards to create institutional changes in how low impact developments are designed built and maintained in the bay area. project activities: through this project partners who set a goal of earning the bay-friendly rated landscape designation could become eligible for grant funding through the prop. 84 process to offset the cost of:  incorporating sustainable landscaping practices in their projects that have significant watershed benefits but that may have higher upfront costs than conventional landscaping practices  obtaining the bay-friendly rated landscape rating and recognition for the property  sending public agency staff to a comprehensive bay-friendly qualified landscape professional training course for the design implementation and maintenance of green infrastructure/lid projects  hosting a bay-friendly qualified landscape professionals training course in their jurisdiction in addition through this project the bay-friendly coalition could also:  assist municipalities with land-use authority to adopt policies or ordinances that tie the bay-friendly rated landscape standard to the development of new landscape and lid projects in their communities.  conduct regional outreach efforts and disseminate project case studies and outcomes so that successes can be replicated statewide. this project directly supports the following irmwp goals: 1. promote environmental economic and social sustainability 2. improve water supply reliability and quality 3. protect and improve watershed health and function and bay water quality 4. improve regional flood management 5. create protect enhance and maintain environmental resources and habitats the bay-friendly rated landscapes rating system provides a clear and quantifiable path to healthier landscapes. it promotes a watershed approach to landscape design construction and maintenance. the bay-friendly landscaping guidelines consist of 55 integrated best management practices (bmps) that improve water and air quality conserve water create wildlife habitat and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. bay-friendly landscapings rigorous standards are designated as bmps in the regional water quality control boards 2009 municipal regional stormwater npdes permit. specific to water quality bay-friendly bmps: -- increase on-site infiltration and reducing runoff-- reduce contaminants in runoff-- increase soils ability to remove pollutants from runoff-- create a healthier landscape adapted to the site -- encourage planning during the design phase for ongoing maintenance that relies on integrated or organic pest management to minimize the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides project cost information for green infrastructure/lid projects that participate in the bay-friendly rating process the cost of implementing bay-friendly practices is incremental to the projects overall design and construction costs. these incremental costs vary depending on the sustainable landscaping practices that the project team chooses to implement but are typically 1 to 2% of project construction costs or less. the bay-friendly rated landscape registration fee is $550 per project. in addition the project owner or landscape designer contracts with a third-party bay-friendly qualified rater as part of the independent verification of the projects compliance with the rating system. the coalition anticipates applying for a prop. 84 grant to offset the cost of each participating projects incremental design and construction costs project registration and rater fees as well as to fund the other activities listed above. ","green infrastructure principles emphasize simple low tech methods of managing storm water close to the source and preserving and recreating natural landscape features. bay-friendly practices support and strengthen green infrastructure principles with a holistic landscape approach that integrates water efficiency multifunctionality water quality protection and stormwater management. the bay-friendly rated landscapes rating system provides developers and funders of green infrastructure projects with a holistic proven environmental framework and independent third-party verification to help ensure that a site is designed and built to provide maximum water quality and watershed benefits. ","there is currently no consistent regional standard for guiding the development of or measuring the effectiveness of green infrastructure/lid projects at providing comprehensive watershed improvements. without a standard it is difficult to know if projects are being designed built and maintained to maximize their benefits to water quality and environmental sustainability. if this project is not implemented: -- property developers will be less likely to maximize watershed by implementing a holistic set of environmentally sound landscape practices including lid and water conservation. -- there would be no common understanding of sustainable landscaping practices (including those that affect water supply water quality and other water management issues) among the diverse group of stakeholders who design build and manage our built environment. these stakeholders include design and construction professionals property developers and managers in the public and private sectors and staff and decision makers in public works parks and recreation capital improvement and other positions in public agencies. -- funders such as the california department of water resources would not have an independent proven system for evaluating the environmental and water management benefits of a landscape project. -- bay-friendly rated landscapes is a well-established standard that is regularly updated to incorporate the most technically sound proven approaches to sustainable landscaping. without a voluntary standard that continues to raise the bar for property developers and owners it will be more difficult to encourage effective innovative environmentally sound landscape practices without enacting new regulations. ","the bay-friendly approach is based on seven principles : 1) landscape locally 2) landscape for less to the landfill 3) nurture the soil 4) conserve water 5) conserve energy 6) protect water quality and 7) create wildlife habitat. principles 1 3 and 6 all directly benefit lid projects while the remaining four increase the overall environmental benefits of the project. one of the fundamental efforts of bay-friendly rated landscapes is to encourage all lid projects to be bay-friendly rated to ensure the maximum watershed and environmental benefits. bay-friendly rated landscapes reduce irrigation water use by 50% or more compared to conventional landscaping practices. it does this through a holistic approach addressing the total landscape from creating drought resistant soils with compost and mulch installing low water using plants avoiding overplanting and designing and installing efficient irrigation systems. the bay-friendly approach not only saves water but creates built landscapes that will be more resilient in a changing climate and that provide habitat benefits. the bay-friendly rated landscapes rating system promotes a watershed approach to landscape design construction and maintenance. the bay-friendly landscaping guidelines consist of 55 integrated best management practices (bmps) that improve water and air quality conserve water create wildlife habitat and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. bay-friendly landscapings rigorous standards are designated as bmps in the regional water quality control boards 2009 municipal regional stormwater npdes permit. specific to water quality bay-friendly bmps: increase on-site infiltration and reducing runoffreduce contaminants in runoff increase soils ability to remove pollutants from runoffcreate a healthier landscape adapted to the siteencourage planning during the design phase for ongoing maintenance that relies on integrated or organic pest management to minimize the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides on average landscapes designed and built to meet or exceed bay-friendly rated landscapes standards achieve a 70% to 80% reduction in stormwater runoff. bay-friendly practices also provide flood protection by reducing runoff and increasing infiltration of stormwater by encouraging strategies such as increased organic matter content in soil permeable paving bioswales rain gardens and other lid features. partners that collaborate with this project will produce multiple integrated watershed benefits. bay-friendly's holistic approach creates built landscapes that are more resilient in a changing climate and that provide multiple habitat benefits. typical bay-friendly landscapes are designed to include a diverse palette of native plant species to provide wildlife habitat and avoid introducing invasive horticultural species. the bay-friendly approach also encourages planning during a project's design phase for ongoing maintenance that relies on organic or integrated pest management (ipm) to minimize the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides.

","regionally the extent of marshlands was much greater prior to urban and industrial development along the carquinez strait-suisun bay-san joaquin river corridor. prior to the mid-1800s it appears that a continuous band of tidal marsh and sloughs were present along the northern contra costa county shoreline as far west as martinez and east past pittsburg. these marshes were influenced by saltwater flows from the san francisco/san pablo bay system and by freshwater flows from the sacramento and san joaquin rivers. therefore the marshes further west have historically been saltwater marshes due to the bay influence and the marshes closer to the river delta have been freshwater marshes. bay point is located at the approximate meeting point of the saltwater and freshwater flows and therefore a \"brackish\" (combination salt and freshwater) marsh has developed here over time. this area exhibits very high biological productivity. as of the year 2012 only pieces of this original marshland remain along the northern contra costa county shoreline. little of this original marshland is publicly accessible or accessible without special permission because it is either privately owned preserved as wildlife habitat or is part of the concord naval weapons station. bay point regional shoreline therefore would be one of the few places where people would have ready access to the marsh its channels and the suisun bay shoreline. this is a very important connection for residents whose communities have historically been linked economically and culturally to the shoreline but now they themselves cannot gain ready access to it. the proposed project site is located on a flat plain of marshlands surrounded by residential military and industrial development. within this urbanized region bay point regional shoreline is unique in that it provides undeveloped open space and valuable marsh habitat. the site provides the public with views of suisun bay and opportunities for marsh restoration trail use birdwatching access to shoreline fishing and other passive activities. ","the proposed project site is located on a flat plain of marshlands surrounded by residential military and industrial development. within this urbanized region bay point regional shoreline is unique in that it provides undeveloped open space and valuable marsh habitat. the site provides the public with views of suisun bay and opportunities for marsh restoration trail use bird watching access to shoreline fishing and other passive activities. these opportunities will be greatly limited if the project is not completed. the existing j channel was dug to provide more tidal action to the property. this was a court-ordered mitigation project as a result of various aspects of an on-site sand-dredging operation. several smaller inter-connected channels and dead-end sloughs also travel from suisun bay into the marsh. these have a water surface area that covers approximately 70000 square feet of the marsh. these smaller channels range from approximately 5-20 feet wide and typically less than 4 feet deep. sand was dredged from the bay by a hydraulic dredge on a barge and the slurry was transferred to the site through a pipe that crossed the marsh from suisun bay. the slurry of bay water and sand was discharged into a settling pond then was eventually separated into a series of other ponds that emptied from one to another by means of weirs and the water was routed back to the bay. the sand and silt that was deposited in the ponds was dried and some of the sand was moved to the south edge of the property adjacent to the railroad tracks. this area was used for equipment storage. the remainder of the deposited sand was dried scraped together removed by trucks and sold. this operation continued until the mid-1970s or 1980s. several modifications of the dikes on-site channels and other earth moving activities in the ponds also occurred during this period. the large there is ongoing planning in the region to conserve wildlife habitat. bay point regional shoreline is located within the region of the sacramento/san joaquin river delta that has been designated by the u.s. fish and wildlife service as critical habitat for delta smelt winter-run chinook salmon and steelhead. in addition the suisun bay area -- which includes bay point -- is the focus of new efforts by the state water resources control board and other regulatory agencies to improve fisheries. this includes managing freshwater outflows from the rivers to modify the salinity of sui sun bay and improve fish habitat. with these regional planning considerations in mind bay point is in a unique location to improve fish habitat. a marsh restoration project at bay point will therefore fit in well with these regional plans to improve local fisheries ","the improved channel network will provide better circulation and exchange between suisun bay and the existing tidal marsh areas. the project will improve water quality for fishery habitat. improve site drainage and water quality: direct surface runoff generated on the site through a system of bioswales or vegetated channels integrated with the existing seasonal wetlands. expansion of the tidal wetland is an opportunity to increase storm water storage and passive treatment capacity. stabilize eroding shoreline: stabilization of eroding shorelines is an opportunity to limit sedimentation and degradation of sensitive habitats. improve stormwater drainage and trail surface: regrade the trail on the southern boundary to improve drainage and sediment control direct surface runoff generated on the trail system to bioswales or vegetated channels for improved percolation and on-site treatment. benefits would include improved hydrology for the existing tidal marsh and creation of additional tidal marsh. flood and stormwater management is about at the seaward edge of the trail or the top of the armor. the roughness of the existing armor and rubble limits the height that the runup could potentially reach but the trail is impacted and likely contributes to winnowing and erosion along the trail. along the beach significant flooding is expected. although the runup is lower at the beach because the slope is flatter low areas and pathways through the dunes could cause significant flooding in and behind the dunes. along the south shoreline the ground elevation is significantly lower than the runup elevation and waves are expected to reach approximately 50 feet inland. the estimates for total water level (twl) will to guide planning evaluation and design of restoration and public access improvements for albany beach. appropriate consideration of the future twl conditions and influence on the site will also provide a framework for adaptive management and maintenance of the site. six special-status plant species could occur at the bay point regional shoreline. all six are associated with tidal marshes or the banks of tidal channels and sloughs. one of these species is federally and state listed and one is state listed. the rest are california native plant society (cnps) listed species and/or federal species of concern. the sacramento splittail and several other special-status fish species could benefit from creation and enhancement of tidal marsh on the project site the following special-status species are known to occur in the tidal marsh and tidal channels on the project site: four special-status plant species (suisun marsh aster delta tule pea delta lilaeopsis and soft bird's beak) and five special-status wildlife species (california black rail saltmarsh common yellowthroat suisun song sparrow tricolored blackbird and western pond turtle). a trail on the south west and east perimeter of the project area will provide access to the marsh and wildlife viewing opportunities in the least biologically-sensitive upland area of the natural unit. these viewing opportunities will be enhanced by the construction of an observation facility with interpretive panels benches and a short loop trail and boardwalk extending to a small marsh channel. the project provided open space and recreational access to underserved communities in bay point pittsburg and eastern contra costa

","the south bay salt pond restoration project (sbsp) conducted a comprehensive mercury monitoring in alviso slough pond a8 and nearby reference locations in 2010 and 2011 before and after major restoration projects in the alviso area. samples of water sediment fish and bird eggs were collected and analyzed for mercury along with evaluation of scour and sediment flux in system. specifically fish samples were collected in alviso slough and artesian slough for mercury analysis approximately 5 or 6 times during the waterbird breeding season. to continue to evaluate the effect of restoration actions on the mobilization methylation and bioaccumulation of mercury the sbsp secured epa grant funding to continue these studies in 2013 (limited scour and sediment flux work is being conducted in 2012). however the epa grant funds were not sufficient to include analysis of water and sediment as part of the biosentinel studies. coincident with the ongoing comprehensive mercury study being conducted by the sbsp mark marvin dipasquale of the u.s. geological survey conducted an initial evaluation of sediment methylmercury (mehg) in artesian slough which receives discharge from the city of san jose wastewater treatment plant. the results found sediment mehg concentrations higher in artesian slough than in alviso slough even though alviso slough had significantly higher total mercury in sediments as a result of releases from mercury mining deposits in the upper part of guadalupe river/alviso slough watershed. this study would supplement the epa study in 2013 by collecting water and sediment samples for mercury analysis in alviso slough artesian slough and guadalupe slough during the same times and locations as the slough fish will be collected and analyzed for mercury. in this way we will better understand the mechanisms and processes that control the methylation of mercury and understand the role of primary productivity in the mercury methylation process. we will also be able to evaluate the methylation and bioaccumulation of mercury in alviso slough in response to the restoration actions undertaken in late 2010 and mid 2011 and be able to inform management decisions regarding the continued opening of the pond a8 notch on alviso slough. the sbsp restoration project seeks the full opening of the pond a8 notch in order to allow full tidal inundation and create 1400 acres of high quality wetlands as well as scour alviso slough in order to provide increased flood conveyance and navigation to the adjacent community of alviso. this understanding of mercury methylation process in alviso slough will also eventually support the management decision whether to restore pond a8 to full tidal flows. the issue of nutrients/primary productivity/hg methylation also directly relates to the sbsp restoration since we need to understand artesian slough hg dynamics as there are ponds proposed for restoration off that slough as well. in fact we are working right now on making pond a17 fully tidal and we are partnering with city of san jose in conjunction with the u.s. army corps of engineers to do restoration of pond a18 as well as the other ponds off artesian slough. in addition we have ponds off of guadalupe slough that we may open to tidal flows for marsh restoration in the future. the 2 primary goals of this study are to: 1. to support the 2013 work we are doing in alviso slough with the epa grant that we were not able to fund in that grant (i.e. hg in water collocated with biosentinels) to support further opening of the pond a8 notch. 2. a better understanding of the role of primary productivity in methylation of hg in sloughs that may influence future restoration of ponds located off guadalupe and artesian sloughs. ","the south bay salt pond restoration project (sbsp restoration project) is one of the countrys largest wetland restoration projects and plans to eventually restore approximately 15000 acres of former salt evaporation ponds back to tidal wetlands in south san francisco bay. this opportunity is unfortunately located in a mercury-rich environment due to historic and continuing run off from the new almaden quicksilver mine (the guadalupe river watershed drains into the project area: alviso slough and adjacent ponds). one of the projects key scientific uncertainties is how tidal restoration could remobilize mercury laden sediments or create environmental conditions that increase mercury methylation and bioaccumulation. in order to continue to restore tidal wetlands the sbsp restoration project must monitor the changes in mercurys distribution availability and bioaccumulation that could be caused by project actions. without this information the sbsp restoration project will not be able to design projects that avoid mercury mobilization and bioaccumulation or possibly not even be allowed to implement future phases because of lingering concerns about mercury. two recent projects reconnecting salt ponds back to the bay are of the most pressing concern. pond a8 (and the hydrologically-connected ponds a5 and a7) was opened to bay in june 2011 through a water control structure and pond a6 was fully connected to the tides through levee breaches in december 2010. it is imperative to the overall success of the sbsp restoration project to answer key questions about these projects:  what are the effects from the partial breach of pond a8 and the full tidal breach of pond a6?  as the tidal gates in pond a8 are opened further what are the effects on mercury methylation and can we fully restore more ponds to tidal action like a6?  and eventually can the restoration planning effort underway with the us army corps of engineers (the shoreline study) to restore ponds a9-a15 and a18 to tidal wetlands proceed without negative impacts from mercury? in order to answer these questions the sbsp restoration project has started a comprehensive regional mercury monitoring effort that builds on past studies. we did receive an epa grant to continue our mercury biosentinel monitoring (fish in sloughs and bird eggs from ponds) in 2013. as part of that proposal we added collection of fish for mercury analysis in artesian slough and guadalupe slough as reference areas with alviso slough being the focus of the study with respect to continued opening of the pond a8 notch. we however were not able to fund the collection and analysis of mercury in water column and sediment of these areas. we are interested in seeking irwmp grant to fund the collection and analysis of mercury in fish water column and sediment of alviso slough with artesian slough and guadalupe slough as reference locations over a 3 year period. ","without additional funding the sbsp restoration project will be faced with the undesirable choice of either continuing with tidal restoration actions without fully understanding their effects on mercury or forgoing the tremendous benefits of tidal wetland restoration because of the fears of possible environmental harm. since the sbsp restoration project covers so many acres in the bay slowing down or forgoing restoration will hinder several regional planning efforts such as the bay ecosystem goals report the san francisco estuary partnerships comprehensive conservation and management plan (ccmp) and the san francisco bay joint venture from achieving their tidal wetland restoration goals. in addition with declining sediment levels in the bay shoreline study modeling indicates that if opening ponds to tidal waters is significantly delayed in the alviso area the ponds may never evolve into vegetated marsh since sea-level rise may out pace sediment supply. this highlights the urgency to resolve scientific uncertainties such as mercury so that pond restoration can be implemented as fast as possible.

","this project would address water quality improvement and stormwater improvements by eliminating fine-grain sediment contributions to the project area creeks by hydrologically disconnecting fire roads and other erosion problem sites. the other main focus of this project is protection of the remaining steelhead populations in cascade carey camp and san anselmo creeks. this project would help in this manner by assessing current populations and providing a blueprint for future restoration actions. ","the cascade canyon open space preserve contains as referenced in recent reports and management plansthe \"nursery\" for steelhead in the corte madera creek watershed. flood control efforts have impaired the lower reaches of the watershed and the northwest forks of fairfax and sleepy hollow creeks do not offer the same quality of protected habitat as the district and adjacent mmwd lands that encompass san anselmo creek. while large-scale plans and efforts to restore fish passage from the san francisco bay to the headwaters continue it is the intent of this project to do its best to protect and enhance the steelhead spawning and rearing grounds that exist within its boundaries. to do so the project needs to accomplish three main goals: 1) gather data on steelhead populations and better characterize the habitat. 2) identify the threats to steelhead populations and their habitat. 3) create a plan with alternatives for eliminating the threats and for providing the best possible steelhead habitat. goal #1: gather data on steelhead populations and better characterize the habitat.the discussions over whether to install bridges across san anselmo creek or to remove the fish passage barrier from carey camp creek have been hindered by a lack of good data on current steelhead populations and habitat. although historic data has shown robust populations in the creek there have been only three known surveys in the past twelve years: a 2012 dfg wsp survey which found redds young-of-the-year and juvenile steelhead in san anselmo and cascade creek. a 2009 dfg electro-fish survey and habitat assessment for carey camp creek found steelhead and made recommendations for habitat improvement including consideration of removal of the fish passage barrier. a 2000 complete survey and habitat survey by alice rich which made full recommendations for habitat preservation and restoration. to meet this goal of providing better data this project proposes to start consistent spawner surveys for the next three years starting in 2013. (given that the steelhead spawning survey starts in january the district will fund this task as cost-share to avoid any conflicts with a grant agreement not being in place.) the spawner surveys will run from january to march each year with a fisheries survey crew walking the lengths of san anselmo carey camp and cascade creeks as defined in the project area--a total length of about two miles. the surveys which will take place every two weeks for the three month duration will use methodology consistent with recent surveys and methods outlined in the ca salmonid stream habitat restoration manual. the end goal is to provide data to the plan consultant dfg and plan partners on current steelhead populations and in turn support the development of actions from goal #3. goal #2: identify the threats to steelhead populations and their habitat. the project proposes to meet this goal by hiring a consulting planner and fisheries biologist to review recent data on steelhead populations water quality and flow as well as the incoming data from goal #1. in additionimpact of roads and trails and the increase in visitor use particularly mountain biking will be examined as a second task with a focus on understanding the impact of foot bike and vehicle traffic on the creekbed at the five locations the cascade fire road crosses san anselmo creek. the consultant will have tim best's 2012 road and trail inventory for their use which has assessed area roads and trails and quantified the sediment delivery to creeks and has provided prescriptions for treatment. the third task in this goal will be to have the consultant assess the carey camp creek fish barrier. this barrier which has existed for the last twenty years was recommended for removal by the 2009 dfg survey of the creek but questions remained about whether itshould be a partial or full removal whether the habitat in san anselmo creek could support migration into and out of carey camp creek and what the benefit to the steelhead population in carey camp creek would be by reopening the mouth of the creek. goal #3: create a plan with alternatives for eliminating the threats and for providing the best possible steelhead habitat. this goal is expected to utilize most of the project budget. it will synthesize the new data gathered with existing information from tim best's 2012 road and trail inventory into a reach-level plan that addresses actions for the project area encompassing san anselmo carey camp and cascade creeks. this plan should address the three priority areas that have been identified in past plans: 1) cascade fire road creek crossings. the consultant team along with tim best will be directed to consider creation of three alternatives for the cascade fire road: a) bridges capable of handling up to type iii fire engines across the creeks with recommended locations preliminary designs and costs. b) multi-use bridges only with recommendations for either restricting or rerouting vehicle traffic. c) no bridges with an assessment of the impact on the fish species in the project area. 2) roads and trails in the project area. the 2012 road and trail inventory conducted by tim best contains recommendations for individual trails but does not consider use or trail systems on a reach-level or project area level. the direction to the consultant and tim best will be to come up with recommendations for reducing the impact of roads and trails on the project area creeks. these recommendations may involve rerouting or decommissioning trails or simply treating them to reduce sediment contributions but they must include sketches needed for permitting costs and gis data for submittal to the grantor. 3) carey camp creek fish passage barrier. this task would entail a recommendation on whether the barrier should be removed or partially removed the scope of the project and detailed cost estimates and preliminary designs. the consultanting team would be asked to present this information along with any other recommendations for steelhead habitat enhancement in report in draft form to the district for review before submission of a final report. ","the corte madera creek tributaries of san anselmo creek cascade creek and carey camp creek lie within the cascade canyon open space preserve which is a 500-acre preserve abutted by mount tamalpais and the lands of the marin municipal water district. the tribs contained in the project area have been cited as containing the best steelhead habitat in the corte madera creek watershed. in 1969 a survey in cascade creek alone found an estimated 1300 steelhead. more recent reports have reinforced that while corps actions have disconnected the headwaters from the bay for fish passage the \"nursery areas\" contained within the project area remain the best habitat for steelhead. the cascade canyon open space preserve region of the watershed which contains approximately two miles of steelhead-bearing streams was cited in the alice rich report for its high habitat value. mountain biking the cascade canyon fire road bisects the project area beginning from the gate at the end of cascade drive in fairfax running through the preserve and crossing the creek five times as it does so then heading upslope into the mt. tamalpais watershed and the lands of the marin municipal water district. this three-mile long road which has the primary purpose of providing fire and other emergency vehicle access is also known as the birthplace of mountain biking. in 1976 the first ever downhill race was staged on the cascade fire road by future mountain biking moguls charlie kelly and gary fisher. the ride down the road was so rough that riders had to repack their bearings with grease afterwards earning the fire road the informal moniker \"repack.\" the repack road has grown in popularity exponentially attracting more than 900 riders at a time on some organized rides. connecting trails have grown in popularity as well; the tamarancho bike park which adjoins cascade canyon osp has added trails and capacity in the past decade becoming a regional destination for mountain bikers and it provides easy access to distict trails. there is also a noted increase in \"poaching\" by mountain bikers of hiking trails inside the preserve which run parallel to carey camp creek. mountain bike use on trails not designed for multiuse travel can cause significant erosion some of which can transport into the creeks. overall the tremendous growth in mountain biking in the area has caused some alarm among the local community and environmental groups. their particular focus in the project area has been the five locations at which the cascade/repack fire road crosses san anselmo creek and the potential impact from vehicle and mountain bike traffic to the steelhead populations. current and past district management in 2005 the district released a management plan for cascade canyon that recognized the value of the steelhead populations in the preserve the impacts of the roads and trails on the habitat and the need for actions to protect the special status species. the plan lacked specific fisheries data however and instead cited friends of corte madera creek reports. there have been few actions undertaken from this plan that are related to roads and trails or fisheries--most of the actions taken have been related to vegetation management. this plan is notable for a discussion of whether bridges should be built across the creek and a letter from the national marine fisheries service that recommends the installation of bridges to avoid environmental impact to san anselmo creek. in 2009 a department of fish and game survey found optimal steelhead habitat in the carey camp creek tributary but also noted a significant fish passage barrier at the creek's mouth. this barrier was caused by a district action in the early 1990's that intended to \"stabilize\" the creek. the 1991 plan designed by harold appleton of prunuske chatham responded to concerns that the creek was not \"stable\" and the recurrent downcutting was threatening nearby trails and discharging too much sediment into the watershed. (this sediment discharge however was seen at the time as a cause of flooding in the lower reaches of the watershed by reducing capacity. the plan did not cite the sediment as being harmful to fish.) between 1991 and 1993 district crews installed veined structures in carey camp creek and rip-rap a the creek mouth with the aim of stabilizing the creek channel. that action was successful but the creation of the barrier has also caused carey camp creek to backfill with sediment that cannot pass the barrier. an engineering geologist tim best has estimated that the floor of the creek channel has accumlated between 4 and 7 feet of sediment and gravel since the district's barrier was installed. in addition to the creek channel raising informal discussions with dfg biologists have led to conclusions that this project significantly reduced the amount of steelhead habitat in carey camp creek abut that removal of the barrier could remediate that problem. in 2011 the district commissioned a road and trail inventory for 50 miles of roads and trails that lie on open space preserves within the corte madera creek watershed. one of the focal areas for this inventory was the cascade canyon open space preserve with particular attention given to roads and trail that drain into corte madera creek tributaries. preliminary results have found high sediment delivery from the cascade (repack)fire road as well as erosion problems in trails surrounding tributaries such as carey camp creek. the contractor hired to conduct the inventory tim best has completed past inventories for mcosd and his methodology is consistent with the protocols set forth in the 1994 ranch and unpaved roads handbook authored by danny hagans of pacific watershed associates. ","if treatments for unpaved roads in the watershed are not implemented potentially thousands of cubic yards of fine grain sediment will be delivered into the fish-bearing tributaries of the corte madera creek watershed. in addition human impacts may eventually cause extirpation of steelhead trout in the region. ","..the main impact to water quality is the turbidity that is caused by humans bicycle tires or vehicles using the five stream crossings of san anselmo creek. this project would not directly impact this as it is a planning grant but would provide clear alternatives and preliminary costs and designs which would allow the district to proceed from this plan to the design and implementation phase.. .the 2012 corte madera creek road and trail inventory by tim best provides recommendation for project area roads and trails that are already contributing high volumes of fine sediment into san anselmo creek and its tributaries. the recommendations from this road and trail inventory could be combined with new recommendations that incorporate visitor use changes (trail reroutes away from streams decommisioning and trail density reductions). implementation of these plan recommendations will lead to a reduction in chronic sediment delivery associated with road surface erosion causing frequent intervals of high turbidity and degrading spawning gravel quality. implementation of the plan will also lead to a reduction in coarse sediment delivery that causes a loss of rearing habitat through pool filling and channel aggradation by reducing the risk of catastrophic stream crossing failures stream diversions and road-related fill failures ","marin county parks ","0","1","0","1","0","0","1","0"

","the project is the first of several phases to a watershed-based planning effort. projects have been identified and are in the process of being modeled for their benefits and to better assess cost-benefits for a suite of solutions. the proposed project is a necessary step regardless of the outcome of the larger study. it has several components that together will improve flood protection and increase aquatic habitat for salmonids. the proposed project includes: a) constructing an interim sediment trap with a large wood structure adjacent to the national park service-owned stinson beach parking lot to capture sediment b) sediment removal at the sediment trap and at six downstream bridge crossings and c) riparian and floodplain restoration and vegetation removal to improve water quality year-round remove invasive non-natives and to remove obstructions during high flows. future phases of the project will be identified after the watershed programs alternatives analysis is complete in early 2013. ","easkoot creek drains an area of approximately 1.59 square miles of mostly undeveloped and steeply forested watershed on the side of mt. tam. early maps depicting the proposed subdivision development in the 1900s show the creek channel close to its present alignment until just downstream of the sharp turn at arenal avenue. the historic channel then branches off as the channel slope loses its grade and enters a willow thicket (on the current national park service land). early maps show an alternative alignment for easkoot creek breaching the sand dunes. with the development of stinson beach and the public park easkoot creek has been maintained in its current alignment to bolinas lagoon. there are three sources of flooding in stinson beach: overflow of easkoot creek extremely high tides and extremely high surf. each of these alone can cause some flooding and when combined can cause substantial flooding property damage and public safety problems. the arroyo and calle area of stinson beach are flooded annually during extreme high tide events. initially when flood control zone 5 was established one of the primary maintenance tasks performed was periodic dredging of the creek. over time it has become evident that during medium to large storm events an active slide on mt. tam releases enough hillside material to fill in the creek even if it has recently been dredged. the essentially flat reach from arenal to bolinas lagoon creates a slower moving creek and a natural area for sediment to settle and deposit. the excessive sediment build-up within this reach of easkoot creek has significantly reduced the level of flood protection through the calle area of stinson beach. the private bridges along the residential streets known collectively as the calles have limited to no clearance from the creek during storms which may contribute to the flooding of neighboring homes and preclude access to and from shoreline highway. these bridges are a hydraulic constraint but they are the primary access to homes and the primary access for emergency vehicles. the county and flood control zone 5 has spent significant funds to perform limited dredging at the calle bridges that is typically effective for only one to two seasons and requires dewatering the channel and relocating steelhead trout to minimize impacts. the creek fills with sediment from winter rains resulting in subsurface flows during the dry months. without surface flow resident fish are crowded in a few shallow pools. sediment removal will increase habitat year-round and reduce flood impacts to the residents in stinson beach. vegetation work will remove invasive non-natives and restoring floodplains to improve water quality and shelter for fish. ","sedimentation continues to create flooding conditions in easkoot creek. habitat and water quality improvements are critical for coho salmon and steelhead trout. infrastructure including homes roads and bridges are subject to flooding and increasing so with sea level rise. project implementation will begin to reduce the impacts and support the watershed effort to address these issues. ","stinson beach is subject to flooding from high tides high surf and from overflow of easkoot creek. the proposed project will increase capacity of easkoot creek by maintaining a channel that passes flows during winter storms. the sediment trap allows public works staff to remove accumulated sediment in an easily accessible location and where the sediment settles out as the grade shifts from the steep upslope to a nearly flat alignment towards bolinas lagoon. the downstream bridge crossing sediment removal will allow access for residents and for emergency access. increased floodplain areas will allow for additional creek capacity during storm events. these areas will also provide refuge for steelhead and coho during high-velocity flows. the projects are part of a larger county-led effort to plan for the stinson beach watershed. the watershed program will build upon existing studies and develop new analytical tools to evaluate and quantify the extent of flooding and to evaluate the range of proposed solutions. the study and tools developed will provide staff and the community with an understanding of existing conditions as well as understanding how various alternatives could reduce flood damage and restore creek habitat. the watershed program utilizes a collaborative iterative process to develop integrated solutions to flood protection and habitat restoration. the marin county board of supervisors recommended establishing stakeholder committees at three levels to support community outreach and to provide overall program direction: policy advisory committee - this group of elected officials is comprised of the district county supervisor and two representatives from the flood control zone 5 advisory board. this committee provides policy input on program direction and community issues and will meet 1-2 times per year. operations and finance committee- the marin county public works director will use these meetings with flood control staff to evaluate progress and prioritize funding strategies and will meet 1-2 times per year. technical work group- this group includes staff of participating state federal and local regulatory and participating agencies and community members with a science and technical background who will be responsible for the review of watershed products and provide input on issues needs and watershed priorities. this group will include conservation and watershed groups homeowners associations and other technical experts within their respective watersheds. this group has met five times over the last year to scope the rpf and to provide input and to review the development of work products targeted community meetings presentations at various local boards and homeowners associations and utilization of the watershed program website (www.marinwatersheds.org) will support communication to the community at large. the program website provides dedicated information about the watershed and is regularly updated with meeting notices proposals and projects. the program funded a hydrology and hydraulics study to gain understanding of the current conditions and to better assess the benefits of all proposed alternatives. the study began in november 2011 and will be complete early 2013. hydrology and hydraulics study:  quantify and communicate the existing creek and floodplain conditions in easkoot creek. develop a watershed hydrology model to identify a set of flood flows including limited geomorphic work to improve understanding of sediment transport and deposition and to assess the rate of sediment deposition.develop a hydraulics model of easkoot creek and model conceptual project alternatives for their benefits (including evaluation of sea-level rise scenarios) with input from our stakeholdersa coastal geomorphologist (john largier-part of the oei team) will evaluate the potential issues involving a direct ocean connection for the creek. in particular potential outlet stability issues and the implications of summer closure of the bypass channel will be evaluated with respect to impacts to water quality fisheries flooding and facilities at stinson beach. alternatives analysis develop preliminary (appraisal-level) designs for potential flood mitigation solutions that are protective of creek habitat and integrated at a watershed level. at a minimum details for each evaluated project should include: description including associated facilities their proposed function operational and maintenance requirements and short- and long-term sustainabilitygeneral location dimensions and extents with elevations of key components where appropriate (e.g. weir(s) detention pond)approximate construction operation and maintenance costsassessment of current vegetation and sediment removal maintenance methodsa list of assumptions and the type of data used to establish these for design development ","marin county department of public works ","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","1"

","the project will remove approximately 50000 cubic yards of accumulated sediment from upland benches of 2.6 miles of walnut creek to restore design flood capacity. this will also restore wetland function to areas turned into uplands by sediment accumulation. the walnut creek channel was constructed by the corps of engineers in the early 1960s in response to widespread flooding of the area. this reach is generally a wide flat trapezoidal earthen channel with a well-defined low flow channel and broad in-channel floodplain benches. because of the flat gradient these benches quickly accumulate sediment which needs to be periodically removed. this area last had selective sediment removal in 2006 and the downstream reach was sediment removed in 2007. sediment will be removed from specific selected areas based on the channel cross section and the habitat type affected. generally the sediment is removed from areas mapped as uplands and wetlands rapidly establish within the excavated areas. in effect the project creates wetlands out of uplands which improving the level of flood protection. because walnut creek is dynamic and sediment level change each season the exact areas to be desilted will be determined by a topographic survey and wetland delineation performed closer to the date of construction. the work is typically accomplished in the dry using traditional excavators directly removing the material and depositing it into waiting dump trucks that drive down to the floodplain bench on temporary ramps. ","the latest usace model shows that portions of the channel in this reach does not have sufficient freeboard to protect the surrounding dac from the 1% chance storm given new design flowrates. removal of the accumulated sediment (as well as minor levee raising covered in another project) are needed to prevent catastrophic flooding of the adjacent airport three mobile home parks and other parcels in the dac. ","if project is not implemented the surrounding area are exposed to a higher flood risk. buchanan field airport and three mobilehome parks that are in the surrounding dac would be exposed to increasing flood risk. a flood at this location would be truly catastrophic for the dac residents not only because of the floodwaters but also the water quality impacts when these floodwaters mix with sewage overflows and with aviation fuel from the adjacent airport. further the wetland areas in the walnut creek channel would continue to lost as sediment is deposited and the areas turn into uplands. ","keeping the stormwater in the channel and out of the adjacent dac would prevent the creation of (and exposure to) toxic combinations of stormwater sewage and fuels from the adjacent airport. this project is needed to continue to provide design levels of flood protection. this project would partially reverse the process where wetlands are turned into uplands when sediment is deposited. removing the sediment lowers the grade and turns the affected area back into wetlands.

","water quality improvements will be made by reducing sediment in lynch creek which flows into american canyon creek and eventually suisun bay. by reducing channel incision the project will create a more natural functioning creek with increased riparian vegetation and habitat. the adjacent upland grasslands used for cattle grazing has overland runoff to the creek. improved vegetative buffers will improve downstream water quality by filtering high nutrient runoff and dispersing flow. flood protections will be gained through creek flow rate reductions implemented with the proposed structures. with these structures the creek will return to the natural functions of lateral erosion and floodplain creation. the project will restore habitat along the creek length influenced by these structure by reducing erosion increasing floodplain size (diversity of habitat) and increase riparian buffer vegetated width and diversity. lynch canyon is accessible to the public through a contract with solano county parks department. the disadvantaged communities of vallejo are with a few miles of the project and educational programs and visitors have come from this community for tours and stewardship opportunities in the past and we anticipate visitor ship to continue in the future. ","solano land trust (slt) is proposing in-stream modifications with-in lynch creek for the purpose of restoration of natural stream functions and reducing erosion in the watershed. based on prioritized projects identified in a 2010 watershed assessment slt has or is in the process of implementing several priority erosion control project in this watershed. the proposed projects are the final uncompleted erosion control projects identified as priorities. the project will construct a cross vane step structure (also known as boulder dissipation structures) below a large road culvert at tower road which has over 8 feet of scour below its exit. undercutting of the road is occurring due to this scour. the proposed boulder structures are designed to step the flow through a series of drops reducing the hydraulic gradient and also providing pools for amphibian habitat. the step structure has an approximate 250 feet length within the creek and 20 to 30 foot width. minimal excavation will be required to place the boulder steps at this location and the construction footprint is anticipated to be limited to the bank area on either side. three tributary road crossings will also be part of this project. the tributaries have small flow-constricting culverts that will be removed and replaced with a wide pressed rock crossing. the tributary flow will be able to use the entire bank to bank width within the road crossing area and reduce erosion and head-cutting downstream and upstream of this site. with erosion and incision reduced in the tributary sediment flow into lynch creek is minimized. ranch roads are all natural surface roads and it is anticipated that road grading with some addition of base rock within the project areas will occur to provide increased stable drainage will occur. during construction qualified biologists will monitor for wildlife including nesting birds and california red-legged frogs. recreational and agricultural access to the site will be safer easier to maintain and with less impact to riparian habitats. upon completion of the construction slt will restore construction impacted areas by re-vegetating bed and bank and upland grasslands with herbaceous vegetation. this re-vegetation will reduce erosion of these impacted areas and provide plant community diversity to the riparian area. these small re-vegetation planting projects could provide stewardship opportunities to students or other visitors. slt provides public tours of the property and ongoing projects are explained and highlighted to visitors thus providing additional exposure of the project and funding sources to users and adjacent landowners. ","this project is a needed to complete a series of erosion control structures planned on lynch creek for erosion control. a 2010 watershed assessment prioritized erosional areas within and around lynch creek and its tributaries. the assessment determined that a large factor in downstream degradation was due to the road culvert at tower road the project site as that culvert confined flow and creates over 8 feet of vertical scour downstream of the culvert. downstream incision and instability exists that can be remedied with the construction of the cross vane step structure proposed. with the cross vane structure the road will stabilize providing safe access for recreation and agriculture; minimize downstream erosion and increase habitat and vegetative buffers to the creek with stable creek functions. three ephemeral tributaries of lynch creek cross a ranch road used for low-impact recreational and agricultural uses. the small pressed rock crossings proposed will provide safety for visitors less downstream erosion increased creek habitat and low maintenance infrastructure. the project envisions some necessary restoration within the creek and disturbed areas from the construction. the vegetative restoration will provide water quality buffers erosion control and habitat diversity. there is an opportunity to allow visitors including students to assist with planting and monitoring of the projects. because the project is in publically accessible open space other landowners and the public can view the positive changes in the creek over time with this project. ","if the project is not implemented lynch creek will continue to have problem erosion sites in the middle of the valley that continue to scour the creek downstream and on three tributaries. with projects implemented or planned to be implemented above and below this site the complete restoration of natural creek function cannot be achieved and potentially may unravel the balance of the creek below this point. a second issue is that of public safety. the ranch roads are used as trails for low impact recreation. road erosion due to the headcutting within the creek and its tributaries pose safety hazards to visitors and maintenance problems for staff. ","this project is not a water supply project however it will promote groundwater recharge by improving riparian buffers and increasing the ground water table in previously incised areas. this project will improve water quality by reducing erosion and sediment flow in lynch creek which flows into american canyon creek which has known steelhead populations. american canyon creek flows into suisun bay. in the watershed the increased vegetative buffers will allow runoff to be filtered thus reducing nutrients from upland cattle operations. stormwater within the watershed will be better manged with the project. for high fast flows during storm events the proposed step structure will dissipate the energy and erosiveness of this flow and promote lateral erosion and creation of floodplains. this project is on a publicly accessible open space lynch canyon owned an operated by solano land trust (slt). the property is preserved in perpetuity through grant deed language. slt strives to use best management practice on this open space to preserve and maintain habitat as well as public access trails. we do this through building up endowments to fund maintenance programs and grant funds for priority projects. the proposed project will benefit the habitat agriculture and public access on the property by restoring a priority erosional location. the property location is in the central portion of the watershed and will positively impact both upstream and downstream creek functions and habitat. recreational resources will be improved and safer with crossing and tributary repairs.

","dsrsd has a successful joint program with ebmud to provide recycled water to commercial and institutional customers for landscape irrigation. the program has 324 customers and has reached its peak capacity of 9.6 mgd. this project will increase the volume of recycled water available so that both dsrsd and ebmud can add more rw customers in our service areas. peak rw capacity will increase to 16.5 mgd. therefore this project will reduce/postpone development of new or expanded water supplies amd will replace potable water currently used for irrigation and construction. the recycled water supply would also offset the water supply provided by the zone 7 water agency (zone 7) from the state water project (swp) which would consequently reduce diversions reduce groundwater extraction and reduce energy use (by reducing pumping). the expanded use of recycled water would also reduce the burden on existing federal water supply facilities such as the central valley project (cvp). the swp and vp water contract allocations are closely inter-connected and the supply of recycled water would reduce demand and utilization of those valuable drinking water resources. recycled water is a drought resistant supply available all year long and can be stored in existing facilities already built. ","without this project there will be additional demands on the potable supplies provided by the state water project and the regional water basin. thus dsrsd's water supply will be more reliant on the already stressed water resources. dsrsd's water supply will become less reliable in the future with less flexibility and less able to meet additional demands from continued development in our service area. economic development in our service area will be stunted by the lack of reliable water supply. dsrsd's customers and regional customers will face their water supplies being reduced; with their water bills increasing. in the event of a state-wide drought increased pressue will be placed on the regional water basin; with the potential of salt water encroachment on the basin now used for potable storage. ","this project will increase the capacity of a successful recycled water irrigation project that displaces potable water formerly used for irrigation. this project will help expand a successful derwa joint venture (dsrsd and ebmud) bringing recycled water to new areas for additional conservation of our potable resources. up to 6.5 mgd of recycled water will displace an identical volume of potable water. the project stretches the potable water supply of the bay/delta region; by replacing some of the potable water from the state water project now used for irrigation with recycled water from dsrsd's wwtp. also drop for drop recycled water used for irrigation is that much less water that has to be pumped out to be disposed of in san francisco bay. the rw volume available will increase by up to 6.5 mgd. so the project will result in up to 6.5 mgd less of wwtp effluent disposed of in the bay and the corresponding decrease in electrical energy consumption needed to pump those volumes from the tri-valley area to the bay. by reducing potable consumption this project will help dsrsd as a water retailer meet the 20% by 2020 potable water reduction requirements set by state law. it will also serve as a demonstration porject for the beneficial uses of recycled water to area residents. with this successful project underway dsrsd and derwa will be able to bring additional recycled water projects to the tri-valley area for implementation.

","drinking water supply: this project addresses water supply reliability by strengthening vulnerabilities associated with transmission pipelines. water quality improvement: reduces fines sediments and reduces pipeline breaks and likelihood of treated water harming aquatic life. stormwater improvements: reduces chronic erosion and risk of catastrophic failures of stream crossing. habitat protection and restoration: the project will improve habitat for endanged salmonid species by reducing fine sediment loading to fish bearing streams. flood protection: reducing stream sedimentation can prevent loss of channel capacity and prolong the useful life of constructed channel improvements intended to increase flood capacity. ","the goal of this project is to implement best management practices on unpaved roads in the corte madera creek watershed in marin county in order to meet water quality habitat protection and drinking water reliability goals. the corte madera creek watershed drains central marin uplands into san francisco bay. corte madera creek supports threatened steelhead trout and once supported coho salmon and possibly chinook salmon. the watershed is characterized by undeveloped and mostly public park lands in the upper parts of the watershed and relatively dense suburban and town development in the lower watershed. this project will reconstruct road drainage on existing unpaved roads on marin county open space district lands. these are unpaved roads with marin municipal water districts water transmission pipelines or unpaved access roads to hilltop water storage tanks. improvements are designed to reduce the risk of chronic and catastrophic sedimentation and road failures from winter rain storm events. specific projects sites and recommended design changes roads are identified in marin county parks comprehensive road and trail management plan. these roads are also important recreational routes for visitors to open space preserves. by preventing road failures on these sites reliability of the mmwd water delivery system will be enhanced because by increasing storm capacity and constructing fail-safe drainage features the likelihood of stream crossing failures for transmission lines will be greatly reduced. sedimentation particularly from fine sediments has been identified as being detrimental to the habitat for steelhead. increased turbidity from road-related erosion is a detriment to water quality as well. the road drainage improvements will reduce fine sediments from entering the creek leading to enhanced water quality for stream biota and prevent degradation of streambed habitat conditions. also reduced sediment will reduce downstream channel deposition and improve flood capacity of the stream. ","road drainage design for unpaved roads have been identified as a significant watershed wide opportunity to improve handle storm water reduce catastrophic and chronic erosion and reduce sedimentation. most roads in this watershed interrupt hillslope drainage direct runoff on the road directly to streams and have inadequate culvert capacity to handle high flows. reconstruction of roads is necessary to disconnect road drainage from streams and increase culvert capacity. this work is especially critical for roads that contain major drinking water transmission lines in upland areas or are access roads to critical water delivery infrastructure such as tanks and pumps. ","untreated high risk erosion sites at creek crossings on unpaved roads in the watershed will prolong excessive sedimentation of natural stream systems impacting fish habitat stream water quality and may contribute to lack of channel capacity in flood events. these high risk sites contain drinking water transmission lines. failures of pipelines due to creek crossing failures in high rainfall storm events could result in negative impacts to biological resources from treated drinking water entering the stream. also interruption of water supply and access to water supply facilities could result. ","this project will measurably reduce the risk of catastrophic failures of roads at stream crossings by upgrading drainage to 100 year storm event thereby reducing future replacement costs for failures and reducing annual maintenance costs and insuring emergency access to pipelines pumps and storage facilities. this project will result in reduction in sedimentation and turbidity in downstream waters. unpaved roads without storm proofing improvements can increase erosion and sedimentation at a watershed level from 50% increase to four times base line natural erosion rate. this project will reduce water quality pollution from non-point sources as described above. this reduction of sediment will also reduce storm related turbidity and impacts to stream habitat for fish. it will also reduce road maintenance requirements and increase safety for recreation users by reducing rilling and gullying on roads.

(2) development of the agreement to execute a pilot water transfer; and (3) implementation of a short-term (i.e. less than one year) pilot water transfer. included in the scope of work for the pilot project is the need to better assess the costs and feasibility of such a transfer including questions regarding water quality system conveyance capacity constraints and regulatory and permitting requirements. the pilot water transfer plan will develop the information and costs necessary to implement a short-term water transfer pilot project sometime in the future if both parties agree. the scope of work for the pilot plan includes: developing objectives and goals; identifying potential pilot water transfer sources; evaluating the ability to convey transfer water to the bawsca service area; identifying approvals and institutional arrangements; developing recommendations for the water transfer pilot project; preparing the pilot water transfer plan; and preparing the agreement to execute a pilot water transfer. pending board action in september 2012 bawsca plans to initiate the development of the pilot water transfer plan and the agreement to execute a pilot water transfer at a cost of $135000. this work is anticipated to be complete by spring 2013 so that in the event that 2013 is a dry year bawsca and ebmud will be able to execute a pilot water transfer. the cost to execute the pilot water transfer is not known at this time but will be developed by the second quarter of 2013 as part of the pilot water transfer plan. parent project bawsca represents the 26 agencies in the bay area that purchase water on a wholesale basis from the sf rws. the bawsca service area encompasses three counties (i.e. in san mateo santa clara and alameda counties) and three of the four bairwmp subregions (i.e. west south and east). the bawsca member agencies currently serve over 1.7 million people in san mateo santa clara and alameda counties. this service population is estimated to increase to over 2.1 million people by 2035. during normal years several of the bawsca member agencies are projecting a demand for water from the sf rws that exceeds their contractual allocation from that system by as much as 13 million gallons per day (mgd) by 2035. as demands continue to increase with the bawsca service area the need for additional normal year supplies will increase. the need for additional supplies is exacerbated during droughts when cutbacks to the bawsca agencies from the sf rws are projected to be as much as 62 mgd by 2035. in response to the projected normal and drought year supply needs of its member agencies bawsca initiated the strategy in july 2009. the objective of the strategy is to ensure that a reliable high-quality supply of water is available where and when people within the bawsca service area need it. the strategy is being developed to quantify the water supply need of the 26 bawsca member agencies through 2035 identify the water supply management projects that could be developed to meet that need (both in normal and dry years) and prepare the implementation plan for the strategy. phase i of the strategy was completed in may 2010 phase ii a was completed in july 2012 and the final strategy is expected to be complete by december 2014. the focus of the strategy is to reduce the impacts to the member agencies from increasing normal year demands that will not be met from the sf rws and from the drought year supply reductions on the sf rws. successful implementation of the strategy is critical to ensuring that there will be sufficient and reliable water supplies for the bawsca member agencies and their customers in future normal and drought periods. both individual agency-led and bawsca-led regional projects are being developed as part of the strategy including recycled water projects local capture and reuse projects desalination (brackish groundwater seawater san francisco bay water) projects conservation and water transfer projects. the specific project presented here bawsca-ebmud short-term water transfer pilot project is being incorporated into the strategy project development and evaluation process. implementation of this pilot project will create additional supply that will help meet the local and regional water supply needs that have been identified as part of the strategy. the results from this pilot project will also help bawsca evaluate whether a longer term transfer arrangement is a feasible and cost-effective way of providing additional water supply reliability for the bawsca region. ","the bawsca member agencies are projecting to purchase as much as 186 mgd from the sf rws by 2035. water purchased from the sf rws constitutes about 60% of the normal year supply to the bawsca service area. eighteen of the 26 bawsca member agencies purchase over 90% of their total supply from the sf rws. however several of the member agencies currently have demands or are projecting to have demands for sf rws water in excess of their contractual allocations. these agencies will require up to 13 mgd of additional supply to meet these normal year needs by 2035. during drought years the bawsca member agencies receive average cutbacks of 18% to 29% on their sf rws deliveries depending on the severity and duration of the drought events. cutbacks of this magnitude are expected to occur on average once every 8 to 10 years and to create a supply shortfall in the bawsca service area of up to 62 mgd by 2035. because of how water from the sf rws is allocated between the bawsca member agencies some agencies are required to absorb cutbacks to their sf rws supplies that are as high as 40%. the frequency and magnitude of these cutbacks will have a significant impact on the residential commercial and industrial customers in the bawsca service areas (e.g. it has been estimated that the regional economic impacts of such cutbacks are in excess of $1 billion in each year of a drought). in order to ensure that there are sufficient normal year supplies within the service area and to mitigate at least a portion of the drought year impacts to the bawsca service area the strategy is currently evaluating the benefits of developing recycled water projects local capture and reuse projects desalination (brackish groundwater seawater san francisco bay water) projects and water transfer projects. the strategy is identifying and evaluating the yield reliability and cost of these projects to develop a suite of new projects to help reduce the overall supply shortfalls during normal and drought years and to reduce the economic and other regional impacts of drought. some of these projects may be developed individually by a bawsca member agency or regionally through a bawsca-led effort. ","the bawsca-ebmud short-term water transfer pilot project is critical to confirming the viability of using surface water transfers as a means to provide drought year reliable supply to offset supply reductions to the bawsca agencies from the sf rws. in absence of additional drought reliability the bawsca member agencies and their customers will be faced with economic and other impacts in excess of $1 billion dollars per year in each year of a drought. further if the water supplies that are available to the bawsca member agencies are unreliable and subject to drought shortages existing and future customers will be increasingly affected. in a broad sense without sufficient additional water supplies to meet projected future drought year demands residential and economic development could be curtailed within the bawsca service area and potentially relocated to other parts of the state or elsewhere. this could result in loss of new housing jobs manufacturing and community services. ","regional project benefit the bawsca strategy provides a regional framework for the evaluation and development of supply projects to mitigate the economic and other impacts of future supply shortfalls during normal and drought years. rather than looking at just a single project for a single agency the strategy allows evaluation comparison and implementation of a variety of projects that could create additional normal and drought year supply for bawsca service area. because they are potentially larger scale and more regional in nature some projects being evaluated as part of the strategy include the utilization of the existing sf rws to convey the water to where it is needed. the implementation of the strategy will provide benefits to both the individual agencies that might not otherwise be able to develop their own projects in as cost-effective a manner as well as to all of the bawsca member agencies by increasing the water supply reliability in the bawsca service area. the strategy and its associated projects address multiple bairwmp goals including:  integrating of multiple resource management strategies;  providing direct benefit to three of the bairwmp subregions four of the bay area counties and multiple partners;  providing solutions that are technically feasible;  benefiting disadvantaged communities; and  providing for climate change adaptation. as part of the strategy bawsca is working with its member agencies to determine the local and regional desired levels of service to be provided during droughts. at this time it is envisioned that the strategy will identify a suite of projects that could be used to offset the projected drought year supply shortfalls on the sf rws of up to 62 mgd by 2035. in addition these projects could be used to provide normal year supply for several of the bawsca member agencies to offset the identified normal year supply shortfalls on the sf rws of up to 13 mgd by 2035. sponsoring agency project benefit (bawsca) the bawsca-ebmud short-term water transfer pilot project is designed to assess the feasibility of surface water transfers into the bawsca service area. yields for water transfer projects may vary depending on the supply source and owner. the majority of sellers identified to date by bawsca have available supply in the range of 1000 acre-feet per year (af/year) to greater than 5000 af/year. however the amount of transfer water that might be available to bawsca and its agencies is currently unknown and will depend on among other things the available conveyance capacity. based on initial discussions with potential conveyance partners the maximum transfer capacity is anticipated to be about 20 mgd (about 22000 af/year) during specific time windows with a lesser capacity available in other parts of the year. bawsca is in competition with other agencies for use of the available capacity in other water systems with access to surface water outside of the bay area. there may be a need for bawsca to act to secure (at a minimum) transfer capacity in a conveyance system or risk losing that opportunity for good. further use of these facilities would require the resolution of several technical legal and institutional issues. an efficient means to address these outstanding issues is to conduct a pilot transfer of real water into the bawsca service area. developing a short-term water pilot project would place bawsca in the best possible position to enact a water transfer possibly as early as summer 2013 and to make more informed decisions regarding water transfer options and conveyance capacity rights in the future. not applicable not applicable not applicable ","bay area water supply and conservation agency (bawsca)

","these early implementation projects will provide a basis for performance required maintenance and standardized details for the city of san francisco's green infrastructure program. these projects reflect the range of conditions suited for green infrastructure across the westside of the city. there will be three pilot projects implemented across the westside basin: richmond green streetwatershed: richmondstormwater features: bioretention & pervious pavingredesign a street such as arguello blvd. to maximize stormwater capture and infiltration. bioretention rain gardens and pervious paving have been proposed to do this. the pervious paving will be installed in the parking strip and bike lanes. sunset blvd. infiltration corridorwatershed: sunsetstormwater features: infiltration galleries & bioretention planters this project proposes to redesign sunset boulevard to maximize the capture and retention of stormwater using infiltration galleries and bioretention planters. while phase 1 of the project is only six blocks of sunset blvd. phase 2 will create a green corridor connecting golden gate park to lake merced that increases the amount of water infiltrated and the biodiversity of the area while decreasing the volume of runoff entering the sewer system and the amount of water used to irrigate the boulevards landscaping. san francisco state: sky to soilwatershed: lake mercedstormwater features: rain gardens and infiltration trenchessfsu is one of the largest land owners on san franciscos west side. this project proposes apartnership between sfpuc and sfsu to retrofit the universitys main campus using rain gardens andinfiltration trenches designed for stormwater capture water conservation groundwater rechargeand education. alternative solutions will also be explored during the design process including cisternsfor reuse bioswales and potential creek restoration. current project assumptions are based ondisconnection of approximately 50% of rooftops or equivalent impervious area from the sewer system. ","today impervious surfaces such as buildings streets and parking lots have covered most of san francisco preventing rainfall infiltration. over time creeks were buried and connected to the sewers and wetlands were filled. instead of percolating into soils runoff now travels over impervious surfaces mobilizes pollutants and washes them into the sewer system or receiving water bodies. during heavy rain events stormwater runoff can contribute to localized flooding combined sewer discharges and the degradation of surface water quality. moreover the decrease in infiltration resulting from paved surfaces contributes to groundwater depletion. while water quality protection is the fundamental driver behind stormwater management well-designed stormwater controls (i.e. green infrastructure) offer many direct and ancillary benefits. some of the direct benefits include reducing and delaying the volumes and peak flows of stormwater reaching the sewer system. volume reductions and and peak flow desynchronization can help reduce the number of storm water overflows reduces flooding and protects water quality. these types of projects can also improve the capacity and efficiency of san francisco's treatment facilities. some of the ancillary benefits include contributing to attractive civic spaces open spaces and streetscapes. green infrastructure also protects and enhances wildlife habitat and the potential to effectively integrate stormwater management into the redevelopment of historic sites. ","these early implementation projects are critical to gain public support for the ssip green infrastructure program inform the cost/benefit as utility assets and meet the goals of the city and county of san francisco to revitalize public streets create green jobs and improve wildlife habitat. ","green infrastructure includes designs (e.g. bioretention cisterns etc.) that are expected to offset the use of potable water for irrigation for existing and proposed landscapes thereby reducing overall potable water demand. other types of designs (e.g. detention basins) act as surface storage areas during storm events and can act as open spaces during dry weather. green infrastrcture treats stormwater and improves runoff to ms4 areas prior to discharge to the ocean or bay. additionally stormwater discharges to the combined sewer system potentially benefit from the managment of tss and heavy metals via green infrastructure reducing required treatment at the wastewater plants. utilization of green infrastructure across the city will likely result in a reduction of flood waters and combined sewer discharges benefiting the city and bay area residents visitors and wildlife. the urban watershed assessment (uwa) program is one of the planning processes for the ssip and will provide recommendations for the earily implementation green infrastructure projects noted in this project form - as well as provide critical data for future projects to be implemented over the next 20 years. a major consideration of uwa recommendations are project synergies among city departments and the public to manage natural resources improve recreational opportunities and more use of watersheds as the planning units. project alternatives will be evaluated using a triple bottom line analysis to consider social environmental and finacial benefits in a transparrent manner.

","this project is a critical and urgent phase in restoration and protection of the springtown alkali sink portions of altamont creek and the arroyo de las positas and adjacent uplands in the watershed. the project would remove noxious invasive plants and initiate revegetation and other restoration activities where native vegetation and stream or sink morphology does not recover naturally after weed removal. it would also help fund efforts by a technical group comprised of land managers with specific experience in restoration and management of alkali habitats hydrologists and plant and animal ecologists to meet and formulate options for the next phase of management and restoration. one of the goals will be to maintain and extend the benefits of this first phase of restoration. these options will be provided to the stakeholders group comprised of land owners local citizens biologists and conservationists to evaluate and implement. specifically seven species of rapidly spreading invasive plant taxa will be targeted for significant reduction or elimination by the most effective methods that are safe for use in wetlands and sensitive habitats. final planning and agency and stakeholder review of strategies and control methods are part of this project. control will require treatment for three years to achieve goals because the target taxa can persist as rhizomes and/or as seed in the soil. successful control of these taxa has been demonstrated at other sites with consistent and appropriate treatment. the project includes pre- and post-treatment monitoring and assessment each year to ensure treatments are effective and net impact to native species and habitats is positive. the most effective methods will be quantitatively demonstrated and documented to assist with effective restoration in other areas. ","springtown alkali sink and adjacent creeks are widely recognized as globally and locally important for conservation of plant animal and habitat diversity. as with most natural areas in california however the springtown area has been impacted by adjacent land use alteration of hydrology and invasive species and requires some management and restoration to maintain its important biodiversity values. most of the alkali sink and adjacent creeks are protected either as preserves of the city of livermore or conservation easements or are owned and managed by the zone 7 water agency or the federal communications commission. the springtown working group is a coalition of stakeholders and agencies interested in protecting additional land developing a long-term plan for the system and implementing restoration and management in the area. the working group designated control of the most noxious weeds in the area as a high priority and to be implemented as soon as possible. the seven invasive plant species are priority because they are currently spreading rapidly in the sink and creeks and because they typically become dominant in the areas they invade with displacement of all other vegetation. as a result they cause detrimental changes to key habitat attributes for native plants and animals. in addition one of the target invasive plants perennial pepperweed chemically and physically modifies the soil it occupies. these changes could result in irreversible degradation of the alkali sink as habitat for rare plants and animals severe degradation of the characteristic native alkali vegetation and loss of genetic diversity. almost a third of the palmate-bracted bird's beak population one of the rarest plants at the site is directly threatened by these encroaching invasive plants as are other rare species and plant communities at the site. ","if this projected is not implemented the seven target noxious weeds are expected to continue to increase in density and extent in the alkali sink and creeks at a rapid rate especially with a warm wet winter as is predicted for 2012-2013. changes in distribution of these invasive plants between 2010 and 2012 suggest a doubling of the area occupied by some taxa and perhaps a third of the palmate-bracted bird's beak is immediately threatened. this increase in non-native plants is in turn expected to result in extirpation or severe reduction and degradation of populations of sensitive plants and animals and habitats in these areas. even if restoration is implemented at a later date the infestations could result in effects that are impossible or infeasible to remediate such as reduced genetic diversity and changes in soil chemistry and structure as noted above. in addition if invasion is allowed to continue more intensive control methods may be necessary which will likely require unavoidable impacts to native species. ","this project would provide proactive management of invasive plants which otherwise are expected to continue to rapidly spread in the area. the restoration will occur along approximately 3 miles of creek habitat and over 600 hectares of the alkali sink and watershed. proactive management will minimize impact to native vegetation and species on additional acreagae by the invasive plants and by the methods necessary to control them as well as save time and money compared to management implemented a few years from now. this project would also allow advancement of restoration of the preserve because the threat of invasion of these most aggressive weeds as a result of other restoration activities will be greatly reduced. this project would also protect the outstanding conservation values of the site. springtown alkali sink is habitat for over a dozen federally-listed state-listed or state-listed-as-sensitive plant and animal taxa as well as many other species that are regionally rare. it is comprised of excellent examples of habitat types that were once more common in california but are now rare or severely degraded at most remaining sites due to agricultural and urban development and associated manipulation of hydrology for flood control and water supply. it is recognized by the east bay chapter of the california native plant society as a priority botanical area for conservation and is indicated in the alameda county rosa project: biological resources report (2003) as a site of high conservation significance. in addition two of the sensitive species known from the site are considered genetically distinct from all other populations (palmate-bracted birds beak) or all other populations outside the bay area (california tiger salamander) which further illustrates the importance of this site. the adjacent creeks and associated wetlands are also valuable conservation sites as wildlife corridors habitat for california red-legged frog and potential breeding sites for california tiger salamander as well as supporting diverse bird life and some regionally rare plant taxa and habitat types. the sink area is also designated as critical habitat by us fish and wildlife service for vernal pools and vernal pool fairy shrimp and portions of the watershed are critical habitat for california red-legged frog.

","water quality- reduce suspended sediments by controlling erosion. stormwater - install lid practices and enhance riparian buffers to filter stormwater from up to 45 residences and one elementary school . habitat - remove invasive vegetation from 1 mile of creek corridor and replace with native vegetation; lay back vertical creek banks to create slopes accessible for red-legged frog estivation western pond turtle egg nests; alameda whipsnake creek crossing to find genetically diverse mates; stream substrate improved for salmonid spawning. flood protection - increase creek channel capacity. controlling bank erosion will reduce downstream siltation that contributes to flooding of martinez and will reduce downstream channel desiltaltion costs (about $10k every few years) ","this reach of alhambra creek is bounded by culverts at each end. at some sites the channel has unvegetated vertical banks of 35 ft height and is eroding laterally. this reach of alhambra creek erodes an estimated 250 cubic yards of soil annually. we expect to reduce this by 50% through bank stabilization and restoration of proper channel geometry. in this reach 85% of banks are affected by invasive plants including arundo vinca and ivy. because many properties along this reach are on septic systems there is concern that unchecked erosion could encroach on septic system leachfields. the contracted project lead will develop and implement an over-arching riparian restoration for this one-mile reach of alhambra creek by working with the 47 property owners both collectively and individually. community meetings and homeowner surveys began in 2006. a set of 9 preliminary design options have been developed from which specific customized plans will be created for each property and integrated into a single plan that would stabilize and restore creekbanks along the entire reach. the goal of stabilizating the excessive erosion throughout the reach will be integrated with habitat restoration and stormwater management goals by requiring lid practices on each participating property creating or expanding riparian buffers of deep-rooted native vegetation to filter stormwater runoff; expanding channel capacity where possible sloping the vertical banks and using bioengineering techniques wherever appropriate. erosion of the creek bank is also threatening the gravesite of john muir. this national park service landmark is 30 ft. from the eroding bank edge at the upstream end of this project. john swett elementary school at the downstream end has an active eco-literacy program. this project would improve safe access to the creek and allow the eco-lit. program to expand to use alhambra creek as an educational resource. this project can be divided into phases which could be implemented in succession as funding becomes available. the goals of our project are to: (1) stabilize and restore this 1-mile reach of eroding creekbank thus reducing suspended sediments that impair water quality and silt up the channel in downtown martinez. (2) improve habitat for native animals including steelhead trout red-legged frog western pond turtle that occur in this watershed; and create a travel/breeding corridor for alameda whipsnake populations on either side of the creek (3) replace shallow-rooted invasives plants with deep-rooted natives; (4) alleviate flooding by improving channel capacity and reducing downstream siltation; (5) prevent erosion from damaging john muir's gravesite; and (6) enhance creekside elementary school environmental studies site. ","there is severe erosion in this 1-mile reach of alhambra creek including bank failure and high shear stresses eroding laterally on vertical banks. creek incision has occurred due to channel constriction hardscape at some parcels and lack of creek access to its floodplain. these conditions are causing multiple problems: 1) the grave site of john muir and his family -- a national park historic site-- is threatened with damage. the grave is now less than 30 feet from this eroding creek bank. similar creeks in our county have lost 20 ft in a single storm event. 2) excessive siltation downstream has contributed to repeated flooding of downtown martinez and has cost the city many thousands of dollars in repeated desiltation of the channel. 3) this creek bisects two large areas of critical habitat for the endangered alameda whipsnake. the vertically incised banks (20-35 feet high in some places) prevent this snake from crossing the creek to find a genetically diverse mate thus isolating and possibly weakening two populations. 4) the vertical banks are unusable by western pond turtles for nesting. 5)invasive vegetation with shallow or sparse root systems represents 85% of the plant cover in this reach. it does little to prevent erosion and further degrades the habitat for terrestrial and aquatic species. ","1) eventually the grave site of john muir will be damaged by bank erosion. 2)eroding sediment at this reach will continue to contribute to downstream siltation that reduces channel capacity and increases flood risks to downtown martinez. the city of martinez incurs costs of approximately $10000 for each desiltation activity; both businesses and the city incur cleanup costs when floods wash mud into streets and stores. 3without the ability to cross alhambra creek to find mates alameda whipsnakes will be limited to a very small genetic pool for mating which could limit this population's future survival. the degraded habitat with vertical banks is inhospitable to red-legged frogs and western pond turtle that could re-establish here if restoration was done. ","erosion control measures and restoration will reduce suspended sediments in alhambra creek. lid measures and riparian buffers will increase filtration of stormwater pollutants. channel capacity at the site will be increased. this project will decrease siltation downstream that reduces flood capacity in downtown martinez. lid measures and riparian buffers will increase filtration of stormwater pollutants. forty five homeowners will be engaged in watershed education and creek stewardship on their own properties. ..re-sloping creekbanks will provide a breeding benefit for alameda whipsnakes; will provide increased habitat for red-legged frogs western pond turtles resident trout and possibly steelhead.

","water quality improvement: healthy functioning riparian areas improve water quality by removing nutrients improving dissolved oxygen storing sediment and regulating temperatures among other benefits in urban and agricultural landscapes. water reuse/recycling: a subset of projects utilize reclaimed water as an irrigation source. stormwater improvements: healthy functioning riparian areas improve water quality by removing nutrients improving dissolved oxygen storing sediment and regulating temperatures among other benefits in urban and agricultural landscapes. infiltration: revegetaion of degraded waterways can increase infiltration through soil decompaction and increased water retention through root channel passages. habitat protection and restoration: the watershed management/habitat protection and restoration (watershed) component of the san francisco bay area integrated regional water management plan states that \"planting riparian species can enhance breeding and foraging habitats for resident and migrating birds amphibians reptiles and mammals within the region as well as provide litter and shading to the stream channel improving in-stream conditions for fish and other aquatic species.\" flood protection: stable functioning wetland habitats improve flood protection by storing excess water and by reducing shoreline erosion from waves and flood waters. related to a disadvantaged community: over 1/2 of projects will either directly improve conditions within disadvanraged communities or enage these communities on public lands. ","the straw projects goals are to protect and restore the health of riparian and wetland ecosystems in the san francisco bay area; to increase the knowledge of community members in the areas of restoration science stewardship and climate change; and to improve the environmental knowledge skills attitudes and behaviors of community members who participate in the straw program. these goals will be accomplished through the implementation of our integrated education and community-based restoration program. the educational component uses local watersheds and inquiry- and place-based educational strategies as the classroom for meaningful and authentic environmental science learning. straw staff consultants and partners provide the full complement of services necessary to complete a restoration project including design implementation maintenance monitoring and reporting. in addition we are in the process of fine-tuning our design practices to ensure that our design principles create projects that will be robust and resilient in the face of climate change. restoring degraded ecological conditions has been identified as a strategy for preparing for climate change (millar et al. 2007 u.s. epa 2012). the restoration of riparian areas has been specifically identified because it can enhance connectivity provide thermal refugia and build upon existing resiliency (seavy et al. 2009). to date restoration practitioners have relied on historical conditions to make decisions about restoration design from engineering to planting palettes. climate change forces us to reconsider these decisions (dunwiddie et al. 2009). these climate smart designs will ensure that our locally-appropriate native plant palate will incorporate species that (1) maximize the number of months that resources (cover food) would be available for wildlife (2) increase the capacity of the restoration to rebound from fire and longer and/or more frequent periods of drought and (3) ensure there is adequate redundancy of design components so that the resulting project will be resilient enough to handle the climatic uncertainty ahead. the straw project coordinates and sustains a network of teachers students restoration specialists landowners and managers and other community members as they plan and implement watershed studies and restoration projects in marin sonoma solano alameda and napa counties. we provide teachers and students from north bay east bay and west bay bairwmp regions with the scientific educational and technical resources to prepare them for hands-on outdoor watershed studies including ecological restoration of riparian corridors and wetland to upland transition zones. since 1993 more than 30000 students have participated in over 400 restorations on rural and urban creeks and wetlands planting close to 32000 native plants and restoring approximately 25 miles of habitat. straw has the volunteer partner and landowner/manager commitment coupled with shovel-ready habitat restoration projects to implement a minimum of 40 planting days annually in most watersheds within the north bay bairwmp counties providing water quality benefits habitat improvement and positive impacts on economic social and environmental sustainability. our annual season engages approximately 3500 community volunteers over half of which qualify as disadvantaged communities using the standard of title i schools in the california state school system and results in a minimum of 30000 linear feet of newly-created habitat. through volunteer and partner support each planting day brings a minimum of $10000 worth of in-kind match along with a potential for additional monetary match as available. finally it is important to note that our project is quite scalable in that we can provide habitat enhancement and water quality improvement components at scales from the individual project to the regional level as well as one year or multi-year projects due the deep commitment of our partners and volunteers and our twenty year track record of successfully implemented habitat restoration projects. literature cited dunwiddie p.w. s.a. hall m.w. ingraham j.d. bakker k.s. nelson r. ruller and e. gray. 2009. rethinking conservation practice in light of climate change. ecological restoration 27:320-329. millar c. i. n. l. stephenson and s. l. stephens. 2007. climate change and forests of the future: managing in the face of uncertainty. ecological applications 17:2145-2151. seavy n. e. t. gardali g. h. golet f. t. griggs et al. 2009. why climate change makes riparian restoration more important than ever. ecological restoration 27:330-338. u.s. epa. 2012 vulnerability assessments in support of the climate ready estuaries program volume i: results for the san francisco estuary partnership. epa/600/r-11/058fa. http://www.epa.gov/ncea. ","according to the 2006 bairwmp plan the protection restoration and improvement of stewardship of aquatic riparian and watershed resources within the region is a primary goal. through the straw project this goal is met both through civic engagement and the creation of additional riparian and wetland habitat throughout the north bay area. as in any large urban region the bay areas streams and wetlands have experienced widespread degradation from development impacts such as polluted storm runoff loss of habitat erosion and sedimentation problems invasive species increased flood severity and decreased biodiversity. straws restoration work directly addresses these issues in the san francisco bay area using educated and inspired students and community members to create a minimum of 30000 linear feet of habitat annually. this habitat creation will provide the critical benefits of water quality improvement stormwater management improvement infiltration habitat restoration and flood protection. in addition the changing climate necessitates that habitat restoration projects be designed to accommodate the climatic uncertainty ahead. the implementation of our climate smart designs will ensure that these projects will be as robust and resilient as possible and will provide the opportunity to educate land managers public agencies and the general public about the importance of these projects as a successful and concrete means of adapting to climate change. the straw project addresses the social component of stewardship through direct community involvement with practices that build resilient healthy watersheds. this is a critical component in the bay areas success with regards to adapting to climate chance especially with regards to the regions disadvantaged communities. it has been identified that disadvantaged communities will experience more severe problems in the face of climate change (colten et al. 2008). the straw project helps to balance these inequities by providing meaningful and successful opportunities for all bay area communities to engage in projects that actively help our communities adapt to a changing climate. the straw project is specifically highlighted as an effective means to address equity by engaging and educate local communities and students and to encourage participation in ecological restoration practices that improve flood protection (nutters h. 2012). literature cited colten c.e. kates r.w. laska s.b.

","the straw project has been providing authentic habitat restoration projects and accompanying educational experiences to bay area communities since 1992. if these projects are not supported the opportunity for community involvement in these projects will be lost. the greater bay area will lose the motivated effective and supportive workforce of over 3500 volunteers straw provides to our various partners and land managers each year. disadvantaged communities in particular will not receive these services. in addition the uncertain future climate calls for innovative and scientifically sound restoration techniques to ensure that the habitat restoration projects in bay area watersheds will be as resilient as possible. these techniques need to be further developed and disseminated to the greater restoration community. ","n/a the straw project will revegetate and stabilize a minimum of 30000 linear feet of creek and levy banks annually. each planting day will improve water quality through revegetation and invasive plant removal along creek banks and wetlands. water quality resources will be improved through decreased sedimentation nutrient and metals uptake and cooler water temperatures. creek and levy banks will be stabilized which will lead to improved flood control and water quality. the straw project will revegetate and stabilize a minimum of 30000 linear feet of creek and levy banks annually. each planting day will reduce flooding potential through bank and levy stabilization along with incorporating progressive planting designs that maximize habitat value in relation to decreasing flood maintenance activities once projects reach maturity. using avoidance cost methodology the authors of putting a price on riparian corridors as water treatment facilities (riley et.al. 2009) calculated that a typical bay area riparian corridor of 4000 feet for a stream with a flow of 0.5 cfs provides treatment equivalent to a physically constructed stormwater treatment plant designed to treat 320000 gallons of runoff per day. using the annual value of 30000 linear feet the straw project provides the treatment equivalent of a stormwater treatment plant designed to treat 2.4 million gallons of runoff per day. the study further concludes that each 7500 linear feet will provide a cost avoided benefit of approximately 2.1 million dollars. for the annual value of 30000 linear feet the total will be approximately 8.4 million dollars. literature cited riley a. 2009. putting a price on riparian corridors as water treatment facilities. san francisco bay regional water quality control board watershed management program. the straw project will revegetate and stabilize a minimum of 30000 linear feet of creek and levy banks annually. project results will show a two-fold increase of wildlife utilization using standardized monitoring protocols of songbird usage on site. in addition plant establishment rate will be a minimum of 75% and will be monitored using protocols developed by straw and uc cooperative extension staff. for community engagement over 3500 students and community members will participate in restoration projects annually with over 50% of participants from disadvantaged communities as defined by students from title i schools.

","marin ","37.920713 | -122.681468 "," "," ","bolinas lagoon is located in western marin county approximate 10 miles northwest of the golden gate bridge. it is situated south of the community of bolinas and north of stinson beach. ","the general goal of the bolinas lagoon ecosystem restoration project is to reduce sedimentation into the lagoon and to restore biological and hydrological functions of the lagoon. these projects will benefit habitat and water quality of the lagoon. the project will also address lagoon watershed issues in a manner that will improve stormwater movement. finally the project provides for improving the lagoon's ability to accommodate sea level rise. ","the bolinas lagoon ecosystem restoration project focuses on addressing human impacts to the lagoon and restoring its natural hydrological and ecological functions. it identifies several recommendations to address human cause impacts to the lagoon. each recommendation aims to provide long-term solutions rather than short-term fixes. the project recognizes that the lagoon is constantly changing and that the timing and affect of future natural small and large scale events (e.g. sea level rise frequency and intensity of major storms earthquake magnitude and timing) are uncertain and that the best way to ensure the long-term health of the lagoon is to restore the processes that allow it to evolve naturally. a key element of the project is floodplain restoration. the restoration and reconnection of habitat along the lagoons edge and upland habitat will allow for connectivity between these ecologically valuable areas and allow the lagoon to move inland in response to sea level rise. other key recommendations for restoration actions include:  remediate watershed disturbances;  remove areas of unnatural levels of sedimentation (deltas) from the lagoon;  restore kent island as a dynamic flood shoal island;  restore eelgrass if suitable habitat is available in bolinas lagoon;  investigate managing tidal exchange of seadrift lagoon to promote tidal circulation; and  actively plan and manage for sea level rise. the project also includes several management recommendations for bolinas lagoon including the implementing best management practices removing fallen trees from the lagoon establishing a responsible wildlife viewing program and developing an emergency response plan in the event of an inlet closure. other recommendations focus on managing introduced species throughout the bolinas lagoon watershed such as a rapid response plan for immediate removal of introduced cordgrass and a plan for identification and removal of other invasive species. management recommendations to protect the lagoons water quality include: developing a local oil spill response plan replacing toxic-impregnated materials promoting environmentally sensitive use of restroom facilities and identifying toxins associated with the abandoned dredge. combined these management recommendations will conserve the rich ecological diversity of bolinas lagoon and its watershed. finally the project provides for adaptive management and monitoring program that includes techniques for reviewing and adjusting management practices based on information gained through monitoring. managing for a healthy bolinas lagoon is dependent on the ability to learn and then adapt management practices. adaptive management is an iterative process that allows resource managers the ability to implement conservation strategies monitor the outcomes and then adjust practices if needed. ","normal 0 false false false en-us x-none x-none microsoftinternetexplorer4 the ecological and physical functions of bolinas lagoon are influenced by ongoing interactions among sea level dynamics earthquakes and sedimentation. since the early 19th century human land uses have altered the shoreline and watershed changing the proportion of human-caused sediment reaching the lagoon threatening water quality and altering the rate at which natural processes shape the lagoon. the result is a human-induced acceleration and alteration in the natural processes resulting in a loss of tidal prism and changes in composition of plants animals and habitats. much of the lagoons perimeter has been hardened by bordering roadways such as highway 1 olema-bolinas road wharf road and bulkheads at the bolinas inlet and along the interior of seadrift. these hardened shorelines limit the lagoons ability to expand inland in response to rising sea levels. many of the project recommendations focus on restoring the lagoons edges (e.g. floodplain recovery and constructing causeway bridges) to allow the lagoon to move inland where possible and to preserve the ecological integrity of the lagoon while preparing for sea level rise. ","analyses of the 1854 t-sheets and estimates from the 50-year projection indicate that humans will have caused a 1.2 million cubic yard reduction in tidal prism and a shift of habitats from subtidal and low intertidal mudflat to higher intertidal mudflat and tidal marsh. subtidal shallows will be lost frequently submerged mudflat will decrease by 26% frequently exposed mudflat will increase by 24% tidal marsh will increase by 22% and fluvial delta (that supports riparian forest) will increase by 82%. species abundance and diversity in the lagoon will change with these habitat shifts. however it is difficult to predict how individual populations will respond to these changes. the high productivity of estuaries is due to the in situ photosynthetic activity of various types of plankton submerged vascular plants benthic algae tidal marsh detritus and freshwater runoff. shifts in habitats that support these sources in the lagoons food web will have cascading ecological effects. the loss or conversion of wetland habitats  and reduction in tidal prism  affects the ecological functions of the lagoon but it proves difficult to quantify how these observed habitat shifts have impacted plants invertebrates fish and other wildlife. eelgrass has largely disappeared from the lagoon and populations of large clams have declined. however long-term data on invertebrates and fish are lacking making it difficult to assess how shifts in habitat have affected populations of these taxa. species that depend on specific habitats are expected to either increase or decrease depending on the trends in habitat loss or gain. for example one-third of the 99 invertebrates listed as occurring in the lagoon are associated with subtidal and frequently submerged mudflat areas and are expected to experience declines as their habitat areas decrease. similarly decreases in deeper water habitat will reduce foraging habitat for two feeding guilds of diving birds (fish-eating and benthos-feeders) and most of the 38 species of fish known to occur in the lagoon. some shorebirds are expected to lose habitat while others will gain. marsh bird populations are expected to benefit as are migratory and resident land birds by the increase in marsh and riparian forest habitats. for example an increase in brackish marsh will benefit the state-threatened california black rail the salt-marsh common yellowthroat  a state and federal species of concern and the marsh wren. ","the project will remove sediment sources from the lagoon watershed on several drainages and will remove accumulated sediment within the stream deltas. project has also identified and recommends removal possible pollution sources within the lagoon. finally project includes working with adjacent private landowners to reduce sedimentation into the streams draining into the lagoon. the project includes several measures to address sea level rise. the primary purpose of the project is to restore habitat within the lagoon through the removal of accumulated sediment restoration and protection of the watershed removal of non-native invasive species and restoration of riparian habitat wetlands and streams. although not designed to improve recreation the lagoon and its surrounding lands are primarily owned by the marin county and national park service and are available for public use. the restoration projects will not reduce public access opportunities and will enhance the recreational experience.

","water quality improvement unlike many watersheds where the sediment is primarily generated from land uses on hillslopes the napa river is also impaired by sediment from channel erosion driven by a drop in the bottom elevation of the river channel. this drop in base level migrates backwards up every tributary and drainage ditch until hard rock or another type of grade control is reached. this process is increasing fine sediment pollution and damage to properties and habitat. this project focuses on widening the main river channel to reduce water velocities and thus stop any further drop in the rivers base level and the subsequent longterm sediment generation it causes. habitat protection and restoration the physical form of the channel translates to healthy aquatic and riparian habitats. the riparian ecosystem needs complex channel habitats to regenerate new trees to replace older trees that erode into the water to provide for a diversity of tree species and to produce the physical heterogeneity of plant growth forms (trees shrubs vines and herbs) needed to support fish and wildlife. this project addresses the cause of poor habitat: a narrow and deep channel with high velocity erosive flood flows. the channel needs a larger area where flows can spread out and slow down. the project reach is rural and includes the confluence of numerous tributary creeks of importance to steelhead trout. ","the napa river is one of the only large watersheds in the san francisco bay area which remains in a rural state. the napa river has been rated as one of five anchor watersheds for salmonid habitat restoration (cemar 2006). with agricultural uses protected and urbanization limited by local zoning the napa river has the potential for restoration with long-term benefits to riparian and aquatic habitats. steelhead trout and chinook salmon spawn and rear in the drainage with chinook primarily using the river channel. in 2012 the california land stewardship institute (clsi) received funding from the california state water resources control board to prepare a habitat enhancement and water quality improvement plan for 4.6miles of the napa river between the lincoln ave. bridge and the bale lane bridge in the upstream area of the napa river. the upper napa river suffers from channel incision with bank collapse erosion of riffles bars and pools important to salmonids and a reduced riparian corridor due to the lack of a functional floodplain. as the river erodes its bed and deepens the 20 foot banks collapse directly contributing fine sediment to the river and impairing beneficial uses. the incision of the main river channel is now progressing up tributaries increasing erosion and loss of habitat. there are four large municipal dams on major tributaries to the napa river. dams block sediment movement and release flood water that has a greater capacity to erode the river channel. the kimball reservoir is a large municipal reservoir which affects this reach. additionally prior to settlement parts of the project area of the napa river were dominated by wetlands fed by distributary channels from alluvial fans on tributaries. over time the distributary channels were converted to more efficient drainage channels and the wetlands were drained and farmed. removal of vegetation and gravel bars elimination of multiple river channels and riprap bank stabilization also took place along the mainstem. extensive data collection fieldwork and analysis will inform the final concept plan. lidar topographic data for the napa river from napa county is being collected along with surveyed cross sections. geomorphic features are being mapped using gps/gis technology. changes in the width and form of the channel the loss of secondary channels changes in the amount of exposed gravel and the width of the riparian corridor were reviewed on historic aerial photographs. a riparian ecosystem assessment is being completed by defining geomorphic units for mapping vegetation mapping riparian vegetation by species and size class and analyzing biodiversity size class dominance and successional stage. the relative number of the four size classes and distribution of size classes over different morphological areas in the corridor indicate regeneration level and ecological successional processes. the mapping found that in a number of locations there was little to no regeneration of riparian growth largely due to the incision in the channel and the high velocity flows. a fish habitat assessment is also being completed in accordance with the methodology presented in the california salmonid stream habitat restoration manual. the restoration plan will widen the river channel and recreate floodplains and secondary channels in select locations giving the napa river a morphology closer to its pre-settlement condition. by widening the river channel and restoring floodplains ecological processes can create a diverse set of habitats including salmon habitat and reduce erosion of the river channel. up to 20 acres of new habitat will be created. high medium and low priority restoration areas are being identified where the greatest increase in habitat values and largest areas of habitat can be attained. these areas were determined using parameters of multiple conditions of the rivers riparian ecology biodiversity and geomorphology (existing side channel secondary channel functional floodplain areas eroding banks areas with low widthtodepth ratios over simplified channels and locations of high medium and low channel complexity). lower priority areas are designated where habitat recreation will require much greater levels of effort and funding. in higher priority areas a strategy is in place for banks to either be setback to provide a grade that is sustainable or provide for passive retreat in which the banks are allowed to fail to avoid overly disturbing the area. floodplain recreation will help floodwaters spread out and thus slow down create flood refuge areas at creek confluences create offchannel habitats for salmonids increase large wood in the channel and reduce property damage from erosion. passive retreat is a postflood response action to replace the typical practices of hardening banks and dumping rock into the channel to stabilize any bank erosion or channel adjustment. because the land ownership along the river is entirely private the project will involve landowner cooperation for access and changes to land use adjacent to the restoration areas. clsi has relationships with landowners to ascertain restrictions as well as areas open to change. this plan will implement the fine sediment tmdl for the napa river. the erosion in the channels of the napa river and its tributaries is identified as a major sediment loading source for the valley area of the watershed. the tmdl documents include specific guidance regarding channel erosion the fine sediment source directly addressed by this proposed plan: of all the sediment source categories channel incision has the highest priority for source reduction and control because sediment input from channel incision is produced locally and therefore may have a greater effect on fine sediment deposition at spawning and rearing sites in the napa river than more remote sources of sediment delivery.\" this project provides a comprehensive approach to the channel erosion problem on 4.6 miles of the napa river.

","channel erosion produces direct delivery of fine sediment into stream flow. the napa river channel has entrenched up to 20 ft. entrenchment of the main river channel involves downcutting of the channel bed into the alluvial valley. as the channel deepens flood flows are confined to the channel increasing erosion. if the proposal is not implemented the channel will continue to be disconnected from its floodplain on the valley floor. water quality aquatic and riparian habitats would continue to all be degraded by the entrenchment process. river banks will fail adding more sediments to the river and floodwaters will create damage to properties. ","by widening the river channel and slowing the velocity of the flow groundwater recharge will increase. the project will provide a major improvement in water quality. the napa river tmdl for fine sediment identifies channel erosion as a major source of this pollutant and recommends channel widening and floodplain creation to reduce this source of sediment. this project would provide for needed improvements in water quality. widening the channel will slow flood flows for the 2 and possibly 5 year frequency flood events. this project involves numerous private agricultural and residential landowners who are willingly dedicating land to the restoration effort. as part of the project a benefit assessment district is proposed that will provide funds to the napa county flood control district to manage both the created habitat areas and existing habitat areas along the 4.6 mile river reach and remove invasive non native plants and repair bank erosion sites while maintaining large wood in the channel. additionally a technical advisory group of agencies landowners local environmental groups and scientists will over see the project design and increase their knowledge of large scale restoration projects.

","the groundwater information is needed immediately because of findings in the 2050 napa valley water resources study (west yost associates 2005 see http://www.napawatersheds.org/app_pages/view/4282). the 2050 study was based on data received from the various agencies and other sources and used a combination of population projections and land-use projections to estimate the potential future water demands. the results of the 2050 study illustrate the need for integrated water resources planning on a countywide basis. based on estimated surface and groundwater supply availability (the certainty of which was constrained in many areas due to data limitations) the study indicated supply deficits for the main basin (includes the incorporated and unincorporated areas in the vicinity of calistoga st. helena yountville napa and american canyon) for multiple and single-dry water years and projected deficits for 2020 and 2050 for all water year types. specifically the study predicted that the unincorporated water demand in the main basin will exceed the available supply by 1340 acre-feet per year (afa) in 2020 and by 5640 afa in 2050. by improving the groundwater level monitoring network the potential increased demand on the groundwater basin and any potential for associated effects on surface water can be accurately assessed. the additional information on stream/groundwater exchange provided by the proposed facilities will be needed to make informed groundwater decisions in the future and ensure water resources sustainability for the natural environment and future generations. the proposed facilities will also improve forecasting of future supplies and effective management of water resources.

","this project is a regional collaborative effort of the bay area water agencies and will leverage and expand the implementation of existing water conservation education and consumer incentive program and build on regional waster conservation initiatives. the program includes a suite of program elements that promote high-efficiency technologies and best water conservation practices to improve indoor and outdoor water use efficiency thoughout the san franciscso bay area. the specific program elements are proposed that will provide quantifiable and sustainable water savings including: 1) high-efficiency toilet and urinal direct installation and rebates 2) high-efficiency washer rebates 3)water-efficient landscape& irrigation how-to education video projects 4) water-efficient landscape and weather-based irrigation controller rebate and 5) large landscape irrigation system retrofit for recycle water. participating agencies will develop design and print marketing materials specific to the participating program and region. agencies will have the flexibility to collaborate to ensure consistent messaging throughout the region. customer will purchase and install qualifying product and submit rebate application to participating agency. each agency will review and evaluate customer rebate application. an agency may require a purchase receipt and/or post inspection prior to issuing a rebate. rebates will be issued in the form of a check or water credit on the customer water bill. public outreach may include customer and retailer marketing and public outreach activities will be conducted to implement the incentive program and verification process. specific activities include outreach to retailers publishing rebate materials and postcards associated with the distribution of the incentives. for each high efficiency hardware install is quantifiable water savings based on manufactures lifetime water savings data. combined these program elements target significant indoor and outdoor end uses of water in residential commercial and institutional sectors and meet the best management practices required by california urban water conservation council the demand management measure required by department of water resources urban water management plan and the meet the requirements of sbx7-7 water conservation bill. ","the purpose of the san francisco bay area regional water conservation program is to improve water use efficiency provide drought relief benefits and improve long-term water supply reliability to the san francisco bay area region in response to recent dry years and other strains on bay area water supplies and the delta. as water shortages and increasing demands upon infrastructure occur throughout the state emphasis upon regional and local water conservation planning technologies and practices is paramount. new technologies and methodologies are evolving at an unprecedented rate. water agencies and local governments throughout the san francisco bay area currently have limited financial resources to meet the challenge for increasing water conservation. agencies need additional support to ensure that staff resources and financial incentives are available to address the water supply challenge and educate the public about what options are available to realize water conservation goals. this project provides project participants the flexibility to select the most appropriate programs to provide drought relief locally or sub-regionally and ultimately achieve water conservation regionally through collaboration with other agencies and educational programs. recent legislation namely sbx 7-7 mandates the implementation of water efficiency measures regardless of cost-effectiveness. water agencies and local governments throughout the san francisco bay area currently have limited financial resources to meet the challenge for increasing water conservation. agencies need additional support to ensure that staff resources and financial incentives are available to address the goals mandated by sbx 7-7. high-efficiency toilet and urinal and direct install program (het heu); the average costs for het/heus are considerably more than for moderately priced standard toilets/urinals. bridging the cost difference with a rebate or a direct-install program will increase demand for het/heus and thus begin to transform the market. high-efficiency washer (hew): funding for this project element will maintain the momentum of an existing regional high-efficiency washer incentive offer. the end use of water for clothes washing with standard washing machines is approximately 25 percent of indoor water use. hews reduce water consumption for clothes washing by approximately 50 percent and energy consumption by 60 percent. landscape rebate program: more than half of urban water use throughout the bay area is for landscape irrigation. of that the majority of the water is used to irrigate lawns. lawns also require regular mowing which results in greenhouse gas emissions from mechanized landscape maintenance. lawn irrigation often results in run-off which delivers pollutants to local creeks and streams. weather-based irrigation controllers: the typical home irrigation system is only about 40-50% efficient meaning half of the water applied to the landscape is wasted not benefiting the plants and results in run-off or non-point source pollution. improving water irrigation efficiency is perhaps the single most important goal for water conservation professionals. large landscape irrigation system retrofits: enable utilities to provide financial incentive to customers with large landscapes and failing outdated irrigation systems to make critical hardware improvements and reduced water consumption. this program will also include customer hardware irrigation retrofits for customers converting irrigation systems from potable water to recycle water a direct offset of potable water in the region. landscape & irrigation how-to educational video project: landscape irrigation accounts for approximately 50% of urban water use in california. this is and will be a primary focus for water conservation throughout california for the next several decades. in addition the amount of water waste in landscape is staggering. problems such as overspray onto pavement leaking valves blocked sprinkler heads improper scheduling broken drip lines and more are common in residential landscapes. the initial concept for this project was to search for videos that were already on the internet. however what we found was that like most items on the internet many of the how-to videos on the internet provide incorrect information or they didnt capture the key concepts needed. water agencies determined that by collaborating on this project the instructional videos could be completed correctly and cost effectively and they could be provided to our collective customers. this project will result in water savings reduced property and landscape damage reduce water run-off which eventually ends up in local streams. ","without this project water supply reliability is uncertain and there will continue to be stains on bay area water supplies and delta. recent dry years water supply shortages and increasing demands upon water and wastewater infrastructure elevate the need to emphasize regional and local water conservation planning technologies and practices. water agencies and local governments throughout the san francisco bay area currently have limed financial resources and need additional funding to ensure that educational resources and financial incentive are available to address the water supply challenge. this program will support the conservation component of each agency's future water supply plan and their urban water management plans is consistent with the statewide mou's best management practices and the san francisco bay area integrated regional water management plans and will support meeting the governor's water conservation goal of 20 percent reduction by 2020(sbx7-7).

","sonoma ","38.25 | -122.63 ","01/15/2014 ","10/31/2019 ","project sites are located in the upper petaluma river watershed and extend from just north of the town of penngrove along lichau creek down through the confluence with capri creek and include reaches on lichau willowbrook and capri creeks as well as portions of the upper reach of the petaluma river. ","utilization of flood terraces adjacent to the riparian corridor provides opportunity for sediment and pollutants including trash to settle out of the flowing water to facilitate easy pick-up and disposal following the storm events. bank repairs channel recontours and installation of a sediment capture feature to increase the stability of project reach channels and reduce sedimentation to the river and tributaries. flood terraces reconnect the flow channel to the historic floodplain reducing depth of out-of-bank flows; and where possible allow the daylighting of culverted storm flows to a natural channel way. augmentation of the river corridor floodplain to capture and transport additional surface flows. slowing the storm flows allowing ponding and recharge through pervious soils within the flood terraces provides recharge benefits for shallow aquifers. as with groundwater benefits infiltration of water from ponding and terracing improvements reducing the volume and velocity of downstream runoff. improvements undertaken within the riparian corridor include the removal of invasive non-native species replanting with native species bank stabilization and installation of in-stream habitat structures to improve habitat quality for central coast steelhead red-legged frog western pond turtle and other special status and non-listed species within the petaluma watershed. flood model analysis of flood terracing projects already completed have proven significant reduction of base flood elevations in the vicinity of the improvements can be achieved. a terrace as short as 1000 linear feet of river corridor can result in a reduction in excess of 1' of flood depth thereby eliminating shallow flooding of residential and business structures which frequently occurs even in lower intensity storm events. ","the concept for the project was created using integrated pieces from adopted policy documents (see response #2 of this section for specific references). connecting flood reduction improvements to opportunities to enhance groundwater recharge is a natural assumption. intertwining passive recreation and public education and stewardship was essential to meet the expectations of an active engaged citizenry and interest groups. identifying seven specific project sites allows maximization of benefits in the areas of reduced flood depths elimination or significant reduction of structure inundation connectivity of trails to destinations passive recreation and public and corporate stewardship opportunities in direct proximity to businesses and residential areas and groundwater recharge in areas of direct benefit to agricultural and rural land uses within immediately adjacent groundwater basins.proposed physical improvements consist of channel recontouring and/or flood terracing adjacent to the creek or river removal of non-native invasive plant species replanting with native species to improve habitat and maintain storm flows providing passive use trails where appropriate and implementing groundwater recharge and water quality improvements within the recontoured flood terraces. ","the proposed suite of projects will help to address several important challenges facing the petaluma watershed which includes the need for flood hazard reduction improved groundwater recharge water quality improvements that support total maximum daily load requirements yet to be developed for multiple parameters and improving habitat for listed species including but not limited to the central coast steelhead. the projects meet the core objectives identified in the upper petaluma river watershed flood control project scoping study currently underway by the sonoma county water agency and their consultant rmc water and environment. these include identifying flood hazard reduction implementation projects with a geographic focus on the upper petaluma river watershed that could help alleviate flooding within the city as well as increasing the beneficial recharge of groundwater. as previously mentioned in regards to land use planning the projects address needs and objectives identified in numerous planning documents including the city of petaluma general plan 2025. in addition to flood hazard reduction including passive recreation and public education and stewardship is essential to meet the expectations of an active engaged citizenry and interest groups. efforts currently underway by noaa fisheries are focused on recovery for the central california coast steelhead an important listed species that utilizes proposed project reaches on the petaluma river and both willowbrook and lichau creeks for migration and spawning habitat. projects such as these that increase channel stability and overhead canopy access to the historic floodplain and reduction in the delivery of fine sediment to the channel are critical to the stabilization and enhancement of critical habitat. in addition riparian and upland habitat enhancement will provide a critical buffer for adjusting to the uncertainties of climate change while assisting in carbon sequestration. ","environmental and economic impacts from flooding will continue unabated. for example the new years 2005 flood caused an estimated $56 million in damages from just one event. groundwater levels will continue to decline and opportunities to slow and sink flows will be missed. summer stream flow will also continue to decrease in relation to the depleted groundwater table affecting summering steelhead. impaired water quality parameters will continue to persist while local stakeholder groups wait for the tmdl process to move forward in petaluma. opportunities for implementing in-stream and riparian enhancements that benefit recovery of the local steelhead population will be missed. ","the proposal consists of seven defined projects linked by location and relationship within the upper petaluma river watershed as well as the ability to provide sequential benefit to neighborhoods and habitat as tributaries drain seasonal storms flows from the upper watershed into the urban zone. water supply benefits will be achieved primarily through passive groundwater recharge as a result of channel recontouring construction of flood terraces recontouring of an existing detention pond to improve function during peak storm flows and creation of a new drainage swale along a heavily impacted reach of the river corridor. the locations and methods for improving localized groundwater recharge will be identified during the preliminary design stage which will include hydraulic and hydrologic analysis on a project by project basis. by providing opportunities for storm flow to access and fan out over the floodplain at more frequent storm intervals connecting with constructed bioswales and other potential design features projects will maximize passive infiltration to the groundwater basin in the upper watershed. additional water supply benefits can be achieved through the proposed stony point detention pond which would potentially provide surface storage for seasonal agricultural use. water quality benefits will be realized through the repair of eroding stream banks installation of livestock exclusionary fencing deposition of sediment and other pollutants in the reconnected floodplain capture of sediment by a proposed sediment removal basin and the additional channel stabilization and filtration capabilities of installed riparian and emergent wetland vegetation and in-stream habitat structures. flood and stormwater management is a primary objective of this proposed suite of projects although it also provides excellent opportunities to deliver water quality and habitat enhancements as well. through channel recontouring and bank stabilization construction of flood terraces recontouring of an existing detention pond to improve function during peak storm flows and creation of a new drainage swale along a heavily impacted reach of the river corridor all implemented in concert these projects will result in substantial reductions to peak surface flow. utilizing the city of petalumas xp-swmm model and project specific hydraulic analysis these projects will be designed to deliver substantial reductions in the volume and velocity of out-of-bank flows throughout the upper watershed. the proposed stony point detention pond which would include land acquisition and subsequent removal of permitted and unpermitted fill placed over the last three decades would greatly increase and improve surface water capacity and reduction of volume and velocity to downstream areas currently subject to severe flooding. this location affords an opportunity to link all the identified project types into a single project with an additional benefit of potential ponding for seasonal agricultural use. the corona reach parallel channel project located immediately downstream of the denman reach would create a linear detention channel to contain shallow surface flood waters currently ponding and flooding residential and business properties. the proposed multi-benefit projects also include habitat protection and restoration as well as the creation of recreation education and stewardship opportunities along the river and tributaries where feasible. the proposed denman reach trail links will provide the last two minor links to connect denman reach trailhead phases 1 and 2 to denman reach phase 3 currently underway with 100% funding and two major traffic/bicycle corridors (corona road and stony point road). the links 740 and 825 in length will complete a section over 4200 in length with amenities such as flood terraces benches educational kiosks and a trailhead parking lot. completion of the flood terracing and trail improvements will result in significant reduction of flood impacts within this river reach provide safe trails between two major roadway corridors widen the extent of the riparian corridor through restoration plantings and associated habitat improvements and provide a cohesive section of improvements for coordination of a neighborhood stewardship program between residents and business owners/operators. the capri creek recontour will provide for stewardship through education and outreach into neighboring residential areas including low-income neighborhoods presently adversely affected by flooding from this creek on a site also hosting a newly installed community garden. the lichau creek implementation project will install projects identified through a currently funded feasibility study intended to vet effective stream corridor management strategies for multiple benefits that include in addition to reducing peak flows and sedimentation to the waterway the enhancement of spawning and rearing habitat for steelhead. several projects will also provide fencing to limit access to the waterway by grazing livestock.

"bay area water supply and conservation agency (bawsca) brackish groundwater desalination project (brackish groundwater project) ","the brackish groundwater project is a critical for the implementation of brackish groundwater desalination in san mateo county. california water service company (cws) has committed to partner with bawsca and the city of san mateo to provide a desalination plant of the bay side of the peninsula to benefit customers not only in the immediate area but also other bawsca member agencies. the brackish groundwater would be treated through membrane technologies to potable water standards for use by the bawsca member agencies. the brackish well desalination project will refine project yields from brackish groundwater aquifers by determining the hydraulic connection between the shallow aquifer and san francisco bay and will further refine anticipated costs for completing a brackish desalination plant. the brackish groundwater project could ultimately provide up to 6.5 million gallons per day (mgd) of supply and will diversify the water supply portfolio of the region to increase reliability increase use of local water supply sources reduce dependence on imported surface water supplies and provide a potable water supply for emergency supply in the event of an earthquake or other major catastrophe. ","san mateo; santa clara; alameda ","38.02807314793642 | -122.38146348274313 ","bawsca started work on the strategy groundwater model in the fall of 2012. the scheduled start date to conduct field investigations is summer 2015. ","end of 2017 ","brackish groundwater aquifer on the san mateo peninsula near the san mateo bridge ","the brackish groundwater project is the first phase of development of brackish groundwater aquifers in san mateo county and will confirm (1) the yield quality and reliability of the brackish groundwater basin and and (2) creates a new active well that taps new brackish groundwater supplies which is a critical step towards implementation of a brackish desalination plant to provide a potable water supply to the 26 bawsca member agencies (three of which are cws agencies) including disadvantaged communities (located in redwood city east palo alto palo alto and hayward) during drought years. ","bawsca has identified future supply shortfalls in drought years for the bawsca member agencies of up to 20% (43 mgd) in 2040 due to reductions on the sf rws. bawscas partner california water services company (cws) will need up to 10.7 mgd of new supply by 2040 given a 20% shortage on the sf rws. additionally cws has a need to develop additional local supplies due to the limitations imposed on private retailers by the raker act. this information has been developed as part of bawscas long-term reliable water supply strategy (strategy) which is described below under the parent project header. one of the groups of possible water supply projects that has been identified and evaluated as part of the strategy is the development of brackish groundwater supply that would be treated through membrane technologies to potable water standards for use by the bawsca member agencies. as a part of the strategy bawsca developed the strategy groundwater model (sgm) to estimate yield from and local and regional drawdown due to brackish desalination projects. in september 2012 the bawsca board authorized funding the work to complete the sgm and evaluation of brackish groundwater desalination options. the model was be developed and calibrated in early 2013 and the brackish groundwater desalination feasibility assessment  bawscas strategy groundwater model development technical memorandum was published. further study in 2014 provided an estimate of the potential yield of the brackish aquifers when limiting potential impacts to other groundwater pumpers in the region. results of the sgm analysis were presented in appendix a of the long-term reliable water supply strategy phase ii final report (strategy report) published in february 2015. based on the sgm analysis bawsca estimates that up to 6.5 mgd of potable water could be recovered through brackish desalination if horizontal directionally drilled (hdd or slant) wells are used versus the typical shallow vertical wells to capture the brackish groundwater source. in addition initial estimates of source water quality as well as capital operations and maintenance costs have been developed for brackish groundwater desalination for different potential project yields. analysis using the sgm indicated that yield could be maximized by using a series of horizontal wells located beneath the bay and distributed across a fair length of bay shoreline. in addition the source water would be a brackish aquifer instead of inland freshwater aquifers so pumping would have less of an impact on inland groundwater levels and the wells would recharge from the bay. slant wells and/or hdd wells use relatively new pipe drilling methods to drill at an angle beneath the bay floor. well shafts screens and a gravel pack slurry are inserted into the pipe to create the well prior to the pipe being removed. the slant well approach was recently piloted for a proposed facility in orange county california and the horizontal approach is being considered for proposed facilities in monterey and san diego counties. as the first phase of the development bawsca and cws (project partners) will define the potential range of hydraulic capacity of wells installed in the brackish aquifer identify source water quality further refine costs and identify potential impacts to other groundwater pumpers in the region via the brackish groundwater project described here. the brackish groundwater project is a shallow aquifer exploration program to refine project yields and evaluate the hydraulic connection between the shallow aquifer and san francisco bay in san mateo county and would consist of the following steps: 1. approach: after site selection implement a step-wise systematic well-drilling and data collection program with the following tasks: 1) drill test boring for extraction well; 2) install and test dual-purpose monitoring- and extraction-well; and 3) install supplementary monitoring wells (one shallow and one deep) and conduct long-term controlled aquifer test. at each point the data is evaluated to the suitability of the chosen location. if determined the data indicates the site is suitable the effort continues to the next step whereas if determined unsuitable the investigation is modified as appropriate. 2. key objectives: measure site-specific well yield and hydraulic connection between the shallow aquifer and bay. 3. duration: of sufficient length to appropriately measure and evaluate the hydraulic interaction between the shallow aquifer and bay. this may require one month or more of pumping to induce a sufficient response and acquire adequate data to estimate the effective hydraulic conductivity of the bay mud. 4. chemical analyses: determine potential changes in groundwater quality and estimate changes in the proportional contribution of bay water to the well yield. drill test boring and install monitoring and extraction wells the geologic samples and geophysical survey from the test boring will confirm or refute the expected aquifer characteristics beneath the site (the cumulative thickness of fine-grained clay and coarse-grained sand and gravel). groundwater that is hydraulically connected to the bay is also affected by tides and the magnitude of the tidal influence measured in the well is determined by the water transmitting and storage properties of the shallow aquifer. water level changes in the well can be measured and analyzed to determine the water transmitting and storage properties of the aquifer. continuous water level data collected in the well over a three-month period will be analyzed to determine the water storage and transmitting properties of the aquifer. the well can then be used to conduct a short-term pumping test (24 hours or less) to verify these results and determine actual well yield. the pumping test results will then be used to design a longer-term test (1 to 1.5 months) necessary to confirm yields and quantify the hydraulic condition between the aquifer and bay. additional monitoring wells will be needed to prepare for this long-term test. install shallow and deep monitoring wells and conduct aquifer test monitoring wells should be installed on-site to measure drawdown in both the shallow (100 feet or less) and deep aquifers (200 feet deep). uncertainty in aquifer conditions specifically the degree of shallow aquifer confinement and the hydraulic conductivity of the bay mud produce a fairly large range in the possible groundwater level response to extractions from the shallow aquifer. this range in responses influences the volumes of water extracted and the required pump test duration. the sgm was used to estimate potential pumping rates pumping duration and monitoring well locations that are required for conceptual pumping tests located in the area of interest. the estimated pumping rate is 0.2 million gallons per day (about 140 gpm) and the simulated drawdowns range from about 30 feet in the pumping well to 2.5 feet in the shallow observation well; the pumping duration required to evaluate the bay-aquifer hydraulic connection could range from about one week to more than one month. for planning purposes we assumed the pumping test would be conducted for 45 days or less. characterize groundwater quality and mixing of between groundwater and baywater after well installation and development samples of the pumped well water will be collected and analyzed to characterize the quality of water produced by the well and identify potential bay water indicators (for example chloride boron and stable isotopes of oxygen and deuterium). during the extended pumping test samples of the extracted water shall also be periodically collected and analyzed to determine relative changes over time in the proportional mixture of shallow groundwater and baywater produced by the well. observed changes in water quality and the water level data can be used to quantify the hydraulic conductivity of the bay mud. parent project bawsca represents the 26 agencies in the bay area that purchase water on a wholesale basis from the san francisco regional water system (sf rws). the bawsca service area encompasses three counties (i.e. in san mateo santa clara and alameda counties) and three of the four bairwmp subregions (i.e. west south and east). the bawsca member agencies currently serve over 1.7 million people in san mateo santa clara and alameda counties. this service population is estimated to increase to over 2.1 million people by 2040. in february 2015 bawsca published the long-term reliable water supply strategy phase ii final report (strategy report). the strategy report represents a nearly five year effort by bawsca and its member agencies to identify appropriate water management actions that provide long-term water supply reliability for the region. for the strategy report bawsca performed a comprehensive assessment of the regional water supply reliability needs through the year 2040 evaluated potential water supply reliability projects that could be implemented to meet these needs and identified a suite of actions to achieve increased regional reliability. successful implementation of the strategy is essential to ensuring that bawsca will meet its water management objective  that a reliable high quality supply of water is available where and when people businesses and community agencies within the bawsca service area need it. the strategy report identified significant drought-year demands when cutbacks to the bawsca agencies from the sf rws are projected to be as much as 43 mgd by 2040. successful implementation of the strategy is critical to ensuring that there will be sufficient and reliable water supplies for the bawsca member agencies and their customers in drought periods. both individual agency-led and bawsca-led regional projects were evaluated as part of the strategy including recycled water projects local capture and reuse projects desalination (brackish groundwater san francisco bay water) projects conservation and water transfer projects. after conducting an exhaustive evaluation of more than 65 possible projects bawsca identified only two types of projects that together could produce up to 80% of the 2040 drought-year reliability need: desalination and water transfers. the strategy report identified two types of projects 1) a project that produces 15 mgd of water sourced from an open intake in san francisco bay; and 2) a project that produces up to 6.5 mgd from brackish water sourced from either shallow vertical brackish groundwater wells or horizontal directionally drilled (hdd) wells extracting higher salinity brackish groundwater from under the bay. cost estimates were developed for a range of 0.7 mgd to 6.5 mgd for a brackish desalination project. analysis done for the strategy report shows that brackish water desalination projects compare favorably with open intake desalination projects based on increased regulatory hurdles costs and issues with land availability and brine disposal associated with the latter. reference documents: bawsca long-term reliable water supply strategy phase ii final report. 2015. http://bawsca.org/water-supply/long-term-reliable-water-supply-strategy/ brackish groundwater desalination feasibility assessment  bawscas strategy groundwater model development. 2013 http://www.bawsca.org/docs/bawsca%20phase%20iia%20tm%20gw%20model%20mar%2012%202013%20final_v3_w_figures.pdf ","the brackish groundwater project could ultimately provide up to 6.5 million gallons per day (mgd) of supply and will diversify the water supply portfolio of the region to increase reliability increase use of local water supply sources reduce dependence on imported surface water supplies and provide a potable water supply for emergency supply in the event of an earthquake or other major catastrophe. during drought years the bawsca member agencies receive average cutbacks of up to 26% on their sf rws deliveries depending on the severity and duration of the drought events. cutbacks of this magnitude are expected to occur on average once every 11 years and to create a supply shortfall in the bawsca service area of up to 43 mgd by 2040. because of how water from the sf rws is allocated between the bawsca member agencies some agencies are required to absorb cutbacks to their sf rws supplies that are as high as 40%. bawscas partner cws will need up to 10.71 mgd of new supply by 2040 given a 20% shortage on the sf rws. the frequency and magnitude of these cutbacks will have a significant impact on the residential commercial and industrial customers in the bawsca service areas (e.g. it has been estimated that the regional economic impacts of such cutbacks could be up to $2 billion in each year of a drought in 2010 dollars see http://www.donpedro-relicensing.com/lists/meetings/attachments/79/ccsf%20draft%20socioeconomic%20study_3_13_2014.pdf). in order mitigate at least a portion of the drought year impacts to the bawsca service area the strategy evaluated the benefits of developing recycled water projects local capture and reuse projects desalination (brackish groundwater seawater san francisco bay water) projects and water transfer projects. after conducting an exhaustive evaluation of more than 65 possible projects bawsca identified only two types of projects that together could produce up to 80% of the 2040 drought-year reliability need: desalination and water transfers. the other potential regional projects provide tangible though limited benefit in reducing dry year shortfalls given the small average yields in drought years. ","the brackish groundwater project is critical to development of brackish groundwater aquifers to provide a new normal and drought year supply to the bawsca agencies diversify the water supply portfolio of the region to increase reliability increase use of local water supply sources reduce dependence on imported surface water supplies and provide a potable water supply for emergency supply in the event of an earthquake or other major catastrophe. taking no action on this project would leave a valuable local resource untapped. in absence of additional drought reliability the bawsca member agencies and their customers will be faced with economic and other impacts up to $2 billion dollars per year (in 2010 dollars see http://www.donpedro-relicensing.com/lists/meetings/attachments/79/ccsf%20draft%20socioeconomic%20study_3_13_2014.pdf) in each year of a drought. further if the water supplies that are available to the bawsca member agencies are unreliable and subject to drought shortages existing and future customers will be increasingly affected. in a broad sense without sufficient additional water supplies to meet projected demands residential and economic development could be curtailed within the bawsca service area and potentially relocated to other parts of the state or elsewhere. this could result in loss of new housing jobs manufacturing and community services. ","regional project benefit the brackish groundwater project could ultimately provide up to 6.5 million gallons per day (mgd) of supply and will diversify the water supply portfolio of the region to increase reliability increase use of local water supply sources reduce dependence on imported surface water supplies and provide a potable water supply for emergency supply in the event of an earthquake or other major catastrophe. the bawsca strategy provides a regional framework for the evaluation and development of supply projects to mitigate the economic and other impacts of future supply shortfalls during drought years. rather than looking at just a single project for a single agency the strategy allows evaluation comparison and implementation of a variety of projects that could create additional drought year supply for bawsca service area. because they are potentially larger scale and more regional in nature some projects that were evaluated as part of the strategy include the utilization of the existing sf rws to convey the water to where it is needed. the implementation of the strategy will provide benefits to both the individual agencies that might not otherwise be able to develop their own projects in as cost-effective a manner as well as to all of the bawsca member agencies by increasing the water supply reliability in the bawsca service area. the strategy and its associated projects address multiple bairwmp goals including:  integrating of multiple resource management strategies;  providing direct benefit to three of the bairwmp subregions three of the bay area counties and multiple partners;  providing solutions that are technically feasible;  benefiting disadvantaged communities; and  providing for climate change adaptation. sponsoring agency project benefit (bawsca) the brackish groundwater project could provide up to 6.5 mgd to bawsca member agencies in normal and drought years from the brackish groundwater aquifers on the san mateo peninsula near the san mateo bridge. not applicable not applicable not applicable ","bawsca (bay area water supply & conservation agency) ","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0"

","this project will improve fish passage in the napa river watershed. at present barriers block access to approximately 25 miles of high quality steelhead trout spawning and rearing habitat during moderate or low flows. additionally when appropriate barrier removal will incorporate the addition of habitat improvement features into the project site and stabilize stream banks to protect from failure. ","this project will result in final project design and subsequent removal of the seven high priority fish passage barriers in the napa river watershed (napa river fish barrier plan 2011). barrier modification will improve fish passage to over 24 miles of high quality steelhead trout spawning and rearing habitat in the watershed. six of the barriers are imposed by road crossings over tributaries (mill ritchey kimball and campbell creeks) to the napa river. improving fish crossings at these barriers will require replacement or modification of existing road crossings. one barrier is a footpath that crosses the napa river (napa river fish barrier plan 2011). conceptual plans for modifying all of the barriers have been developed. for four of the barriers (dry kimball campbell creeks and napa river) funding is needed for both construction design development and implementation. for the remaining three barriers (two on ritchey creek and one on mill creek) funding is needed for permitting and implementation only. designs will be developed by an engineer and design firm with input from the napa county resource conservation district (rcd) and landowners (the city of calistoga ca state parks napa county). the firm will conduct a topographic survey of the barrier sites then conduct geomorphic assessments hydraulic modeling and geotechnical analyses to inform their design plans. the final design documents may then be used as a basis for contractor bidding and contracting. the design plans will include a title sheet (general notes location); demolition staging and access plan; project layout; profiles and cross-sections; channel restoration and bank stabilization details; structural details for thebridge; revegetation and erosion control plans and details. specifications will outline and describe tolerances and materials detailed in the project plans. upon completion of the 100% design and with coordination between design firm rcd and the city of calistoga the rcd or the city should have all materials necessary to obtain permits and hire contractors for implementation. ","the napa river watershed encompasses an area of approximately 426 square miles at the northern end of san pablo bay in the san francisco estuary. the napa river and its tributaries support a diverse community of native fishes including two salmonid species: steelhead and chinook salmon. steelhead spawning and rearing occurs primarily in the smaller high-gradient tributary streams throughout the watershed while chinook spawning and rearing occurs primarily in the mainstem napa river and low-gradient reaches of some large tributary streams. both species are anadromous meaning they need an uninterrupted corridor from their freshwater spawning and rearing habitat to the ocean. artificial migration barriers constructed during the past century have contributed to population declines of salmonids in the napa river watershed by limiting access to potential habitat (stillwater sciences 2002). these obstructions range from small temporal barriers which can delay upstream migration depending on flow conditions to large-scale municipal dams (e.g. conn dam rector dam etc.) which completely cut off access to otherwise suitable habitat. steelhead return to the napa river to spawn in the winter typically from january to march; although in years with abundant late-season rainfall adult fish have been observed spawning as late as may. steelhead spawning is difficult to document because adult fish migrate primarily at night and spawn during winter storm flows when water clarity is low. therefore not much is known about the specific movement patterns of adult steelhead in the napa river watershed. in order to maximize access to high-gradient and often intermittent streams adult fish typically migrate upstream on the receding limbs of winter storm flows. in years with below average runoff access to small tributary streams which this species prefers can be limited. steelhead spawning in the mainstem napa river has been recently documented although it appears to be most prevalent in dry years when access to prime tributary spawning habitat is limited by low streamflow (koehler and blank 2010). juvenile steelhead rear in freshwater for one or more years before smolting (outmigrating) to the ocean. juvenile fish typically remain in cool shady streams with perennial flow for up to three years before smolting at 125 to 200 mm in length (koehler and blank 2011). during their freshwater rearing and growth phase juvenile steelhead feed mostly on aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates and may move around within a stream and between streams at higher flows. therefore unimpeded migration and dispersal routes are an important component of steelhead rearing habitat. the napa river fish barrier plan (2011) assessed hydraulic impacts and upstream fish habitat quality for the 21 highest priority fish passage barriers in the watershed (118 barriers have been identified high priority barriers are severe or impede access to high quality habitat). the plan identifies the seven barriers in this proposal as the barriers that should receive the highest priority for mitigation because they impedes access to 24 miles of high quality steelhead spawning and rearing habitat. the seven named tributaries feeding into the napa river above the foot path barrier mill creek campbell creek dry creek and kimball cree offer abundant and relatively high quality spawning and rearing habitat for steelhead trout and chinook salmon. the tributaries also support steelhead spawning to differing degrees. in contrast chinook are not believed to utilize these smaller streams regularly. in addition to steelhead and chinook the napa river also supports an assemblage of 13 other native fish species including two that are migratory: pacific lamprey and river lamprey. ","if this proposal is not implemented the existing fish passage barriers will continue to impedes fish access to 24 miles of high quality steelhead spawning and rearing habitat in the napa river watershed.

","if the beach watch program did not exist there would be no long-term record of what is \"normal\" for each of the program's 41 beach segments along the coast of the bay area. decision-making by resource managers would be less informed and valuable habitat and species would suffer as a result. ","the beach watch program's benefits will most visibly be seen in terms of habitat protection and restoration. these benefits can be measured by documenting the number of a particular endangered or threatened species spotted during surveys over time. in addition the program collects data on tarballs encountered during surveys. finally human activity is recorded during surveys using categories such as \"fishing\" \"dog walking\" and \"boating.\" with these data the beach watch program can quantify the change in human activity on a beach over time and this can be used to determine the benefits to habitat protection by the program. as mentioned above the beach watch program also provides essential data on the health of beaches before during and after an environmental disaster such as an oil spill. this information is used by scat teams and is also valuable in allocating clean-up resources to where they are most needed--a beach with nesting snowy plovers for instance. with beach surveys consistently continuing even after the disaster the beach watch program plays a vital role in documenting the restoration and recovery of each beach segment.

","the proposed low impact development measures will address water quality problems typical of runoff from parking lots and roofs. problem constituents include: suspended solids (coarse sand to finer silts and clays) gasoline and motor oil from the impervious surfaces as well as fertilizers and pesticides (nitrates and phosphates) from the landscaped areas. other pollutants include: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) heavy metals nickel copper zinc cadmium and lead hydrocarbons from atmospheric deposition and trash (such as paper plastic polystyrene packing foam and aluminum materials) and biodegradable organic debris (such as leaves grass cuttings and food waste) that can be entrained in urban runoff. ","the proposed project seeks to implement low impact development (lid) measures within a design to retrofit two existing parking lots that service alameda county public works agency (acpwa) buildings 951 and 951a turner court in hayward alameda county california. the proposed project seeks to treat all of the flow draining both parking lots. the following lid site design and biotreatment measures will be implemented at the project site: pervious asphalt porous concrete and permeable pavers bioretention (rain gardens biofiltration and green gutters) flow-through and stormwater planters interceptor trees and rain barrels. the proposed project will serve as a site for education and outreach of lid concepts for alameda county contractors and clean water program stormwater managers. built in the 1950s the existing parking lots currently provide no stormwater runoff water quality treatment. at 951 turner court the existing site drainage area (120000 sq. ft) consists of impervious asphalt paving roof runoff and small landscaped areas. all flow is routed below building 951 to the city of hayward storm drain system. at the smaller 951a turner court building the site drainage area (22000 sq. ft.) flows south to a storm drain inlet that directly connects to the city storm drain. both project sites ultimately drain into the old alameda creek flood control channel. at 951 turner court impervious areas will be reduced from 85% to 35% of the drainage area; at 951a impervious areas will be reduced from 50% to 40%. the design intent is to treat all stormwater runoff that drains to the receiving outlets at each site. the design approach follows the lid feasibility evaluation process (bay area stormwater management agencies association 2011). implementation of low impact development measures throughout the project site and minimizing impervious surface areas while providing adequate drainage and parking facilities should pose no risks to water quality. ","project lid components can help reduce pollutant loading to the old alameda creek watershed by reducing sedimentation petroleum hydrocarbons metals nutrients trash and debris input into the waterways. as per the san francisco bay rwqcb resolution no. r2-2010-0100 the basin plan was amended to include additional surface water bodies. this basin plan amendment was adopted by the water board on july 14 2010. the state water board approved this amendment on december 5 2011. one of the new surface water bodies added to the basin plan was old alameda creek (south bay basin) (the project watershed) and its beneficial uses were listed as: estuarine habitat wildlife habitat water contact recreation non-water contact recreation. possible pollutants from parking lot impervious surface runoff can impact the beneficial uses in the following ways: excessive erosion transport and deposition of sediment in surface waters are a significant form of pollution resulting in water quality impairments. excessive sediment can impair aquatic life by reducing beneficial habitat structure in stream channels affecting benthic fauna by filling interstitial spaces of spawning gravels impairing fish food sources and filling rearing pools. petroleum hydrocarbons such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) can bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms from contaminated water sediments and food and are toxic to aquatic life at low concentrations. hydrocarbons can persist in sediments for long periods of time and result in adverse impacts on the diversity and abundance of benthic communities. trace metals are of concern because of the potential for toxic effects on aquatic life and the potential for ground water contamination resulting from surface water infiltration to underlying aquifer systems. high metal concentrations can lead to bioaccumulation in fish and shellfish and affect beneficial uses of receiving waters. ","untreated stormwater runoff from roofs and parking lots will continue to flow directly into the piped storm drain system. ","lid components will yield greater infiltration for local groundwater recharge. lid components will provide water quality treatment for stormwater runoff. this will result in pollutant load reductions including total suspended sediments (tss) nutrients and metals. following the accwp c.3. technical guidance manual procedures major lid components have been sized to ensure adequate volume and duration for treated impervious areas flowing to each component. this preliminary hydraulic sizing of the stormwater treatment measures uses the municipal regional stormwater permits flow-based sizing criteria. this sizing procedure requires use of parameters such as drainage area impervious area composite runoff coefficient required capture volume and drawdown time for the treatment measure in order to calculate a) treatment area without any storage (maximum required area of biotreatment) and b) treatment area if maximum storage of 12 inches is allowed (minimum required area of biotreatment with 1-ft storage). preliminary calculations show that the areas available for proposed bioretention have more than sufficient area for treatment of all tributary impervious areas. in this project pervious pavement and porous concrete reduce total impervious surface areas by nearly 50%. raingardens detention basins and bioswales will promote greater infiltration rates creating decreased runoff to storm drains. according to the accwp c.3 technical guidance manual (2011) hydromodification management over the project must be designed such that any increase in surface runoff must be retained on-site with gradual discharge either to groundwater through infiltration losses by evapotranspiration and/or discharge to the downstream watercourse at a level below the critical flow that causes creek channel erosion. the method of flow duration control is specified for design of hydromodification components which manages runoff discharge over the full range of runoff flow levels predicted through continuous hydrologic simulation modeling based on a long-term precipitation record. the bay area hydrology model (bahm) was applied to predict pre- and post-development flows. bahm includes continuous simulation modeling or pre- and post-project runoff from the site using actual long-term rainfall records scaled for the project location. in this project the amount of impervious area is actually reduced--from 84% to 35% at building 951 and from 50% to 40% at 951a. existing land-use conditions (impervious and pervious) were run against proposed land-use conditions over the site and the results show that the various lid features and increased pervious surfaces produce a mitigated condition where post-project runoff was less than pre-project flow rates.

"fish passage improvements at memorial county park san mateo county "," ","san mateo county ","37.35 | -122.375 ","this project can be initiated immediately upon award of grant funding.  ","this project will take 18 to 24 months to complete. ","the project addresses fish passage barriers at two sites both located within memorial county park san mateo county on pescadero creek in the pescadero-butano creek watershed. memorial county park is located at 9500 pescadero creek road loma mar 94021. the sequoia flats crossing and the seasonal dam upstream on the main stem of pescadero creek. both sites are within san mateo memorial county park in southern san mateo county near the town of loma mar. the first site is the sequoia flats crossing located near the sequoia flats family camp on the northern side of memorial county park approximately 2860 feet upstream from the vehicle crossing near the tan oak trail. the extent of this site is 200 feet. the second site is the seasonal dam is located near the amphitheater on the southern side of the park. the total extent of this site is approximately 100 feet and the extent of excavation is approximately 60 feet. together the extent of work is 300 feet. the park is located in southern san mateo county about eight linear miles inland from the pacific ocean. ","this project will restore access for salmonids to 62.3 miles of spawning and rearing habitat by modifying the two remaining fish passage barriers on pescadero creek. additionally the immediate site conditions will be improved through the readjustment of the stream bed morphology when the instream structures are modified. ","the project will modifying the two remaining fish passage barriers on pescadero creek to improve migratory conditions for coho salmon as well as benefit migratory conditions for steelhead trout.restoration elements proposed at sequoia flats crossing site : the sequoia flats vehicle ford is the first of two fish passage barriers on pescadero creek to be addressed by the project. design objectives at this site are to facilitate fish passage (especially local fish passage during low flow conditions) lower the invert opening so that stored sediment upstream of the structure can be naturally transported downstream and a more biological beneficial and stable channel morphology can re-establish itself. other objectives are to widen the low flow opening to the maximum extent possible thereby increasing the window of opportunity for fish passage through the crossing at low flows and prevent hydraulic impacts to flow in the channel. finally the design reflects concerns to continue to allow park users safe summer-time access to the sequoia flat family campground. to implement the project the existing vehicle ford would be demolished and replaced by a permanent pre-cast 15-wide arched culvert.restoration elements proposed at dam site: the dam was established in 1938 and previously included flashboards that enabled the area to be used for swimming for park visitors. these flashboards were also thought to support county parks water intake upstream. in 2001 the flashboards were removed after serious discussion among county parks and the fisheries agencies about how to address this barrier to fish passage at the site. the current designs include adding a broad v-notch that extends nearly the width of the sill will be removed. this option would modify the dam to create a v-notch approximately 37 feet wide with a maximum depth of 4.1 feet with a 2-foot wide by 0.5-foot wide deep low flow channel at the bottom. in addition the concrete wing walls would be removed down to the level of the rip-rap immediately downstream . the surface of the dam would be left fairly irregular with roughness features added once the notch is cut and an adverse slope created at the dam to form a small low-velocity area just upstream of the lip of the dam. ","the project remediates the two remaining fish passage barriers on the mainstem of pescadero creek that limit access to more than 60 miles of spawning and rearing habitat in the creek and its tributaries in the upper watershed. both salmon and trout live out their freshwater life stages in san mateo county including coho salmon (oncorhynchus kisutch) and steelhead trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) but these species have experienced substantial population declines here. while steelhead are still found in numerous streams coho remain as spawning populations in only a few streams. populations are federally listed as endangered or threatened under the federal endangered species act (esa). the central california coast evolutionary significant unit (esu) includes san mateo county and was among one of the first in which both coho and steelhead were listed. historically coho ran in pescadero creek [1] . while coho are not currently present in the watershed the pescadero watershed is critical for the long-term viability of the species as it will undoubtedly benefit from the barrier remediation actions over the long term. it is the only independent watershed (from a coho recovery perspective) in san mateo county. this means recovery of coho here is inextricably linked to successful recovery in this watershed. all actions supporting recovery including timely passage to spawning grounds and movement of juveniles is all that much more critical. and of course steelhead will enjoy immediate benefits when these barriers are addressed both in the short and long term the restoration and protection of pescadero creek and its watershed is a conservation priority for the state of california for reduction of sediment and addressing sediment transport within the watershed. the regional water quality control board (rwqcb) has designated this watershed under the cwa section 303(d) as impaired by excessive sedimentation due to erosion and sediment from natural geologic and climatic processes intensified by human land use practices including roads and timber clearcutting. excess sediment has degraded aquatic habitat and led to declining populations of rare and endangered species including coho salmon steelhead trout tidewater goby california red-legged frog and san francisco garter snake. rwqcb is in the process of establishing a total daily maximum load (tmdl) for sediment for the watershed [1]. the creek and its watershed is also a conservation priority for the state of california for recovery of salmonids. the dfg 2004 recovery strategy for california coho salmon includes priority tasks for implementation in the pescadero creek watershed including the work proposed for completion through this project. the dfg 1996 steelhead restoration and management plan for california including the 2012 updated task list included priority tasks for implementation in the pescadero creek watershed also including work proposed to be completed through this project. the creek and the watershed is also a conservation priority for the federal government as indicated in the national marine fisheries service (nmfs) 2010 draft ccc coho salmon recovery plan: appendix f-pescadero creek watershed. the creek its watershed and work at the two sites are also high priorities as identified through the integrated watershed restoration program (iwrp) managed by the california state coastal conservancy (scc). iwrp focuses on a voluntary non-regulatory approach to watershed restoration by providing funds for project designs and permits and establishing an interagency technical advisory committee (tac). the tac consists of representatives of various state and federal resource agencies who vet project plans and design and address permitting issues. iwrp for san mateo county identified the two fish passage barriers in memorial county park as high priorities for remediation. dfg is a member (jennifer nelson and krissy atkinson) of the tac and recommended the two sites be identified as priorities for remediation. dfg staff elliott dass and marcin whitman also asked the rcd to step forward as the applicant to see this project completed. work at the two sites were identified in the iwrp 2009 document list of iwrp tac priority projects for san mateo santa cruz and monterey counties compiled by kellyx nelson jim robins and paul robins. finally in light of climate change models and the potential for water to become warmer summer flows to become reduced and the range of redwoods to shrink (conifer forest is directly correlated to coho habitat) this project can support upstream movement of juveniles during the dry months. this is especially important in the pescadero due to the issue related to anoxia and fishkills in the pescadero marsh downstream. ","the two fish passage barriers impede migratory conditions for coho salmon and steelhead trout and impede natural geomorphic function upstream and downstream of the structures. causes of existing problems at sequoia flats crossing site: this vehicle ford is the first of two fish passage barriers on pescadero creek to be addressed by the project. the ford provides summer access across pescadero creek near the sequoia flat family campground. it is not used during the winter but remains in place across the creek. because the crossing is overtopped during typical wintertime base flow the fundamental goal of the project was to provide juvenile movement during low flow stages reduce difficulties for entering the structure reduce maintenance and clogging issues and provide a better all-around fish passage conditions for the structure. the project was design to meet juvenile fish passage criteria from 3 cfs and a maximum of 20 cfs. above 200 cfs and the structure is overtopped and fish passage is no longer needed through the structure. the structure is being replaced for several reasons; first the invert of the low flow opening/fish passage is high and as a result the structure has trapped sediment and degraded bed morphology conditions for approximately 600 feet upstream and second the current fish way structure is in disrepair clogs easily and is restricts juvenile passage during the low flow months. also the slope of the structure general increases downstream. this accelerates flow and creates a jump into the structure at low flows for juvenile fish. the current velocities exceed juvenile passage criteria of 1 ft/sec throughout the structure. the structure can carry approximately 35 cfs before it over tops the concrete roadway. adults can utilize the fishway at up 30 cfs but the entrance and the lower 20 feet or so of the structure has high velocities that are near or slightly exceed the cdfg passage criteria at these flows. existing problems at seasonal dam site: the dam was established in 1938 and previously included flashboards that enabled the area to be used for swimming for park visitors. these flashboards were also thought to support county parks water intake upstream. in 2001 when the flashboards were removed after serious discussion among county parks and the fisheries agencies about how to address this barrier to fish passage at the site. modifying the remaining concrete foundation of the dam is the second fish passage barrier to be addressed by the project. the current barrier is approximately 1 to 3 feet tall depending on the flow and tailwater condition. the vertical drop of the dam is highest during low flows and can be drown out during very high flow conditions. it is generally believed that upstream migrating adult salmonids (especially steelhead which most regional models are based on) can pass the dam. juveniles or younger fish however most likely cannot pass the up to 3-foot jump that can exist at the dam. the plunge pool at the base of the dam provides favorable conditions for jumping but the top of the dam is broad and flat and the shallow high-velocity flow creates difficult landing conditions for upstream migrating juveniles. in addition to the dam foundation there are wing walls and a concrete wall steps and pad that extend approximately 200 feet upstream of the dam on the north bank. the habitat conditions upstream of the dam are poor. the bed is relatively flat and wide the flow is generally shallow with few relatively shallow pools and there is an almost complete lack of cover and woody debris. these conditions are partly due to sediment that has been deposited in behind the dam and created a wide flat low-gradient channel. to some extent though the research immediately upstream of the dam is naturally straight and uniform and should function as a natural transport reach for sediment and wood. channel complexity substrate size mid-channel vegetation and bars woody debris pools depth depth to width ratio and sinuosity begin to increase upstream of the dam with more favorable habitat existing approximately 950 feet upstream of the dam. ","spawning benefits: while most of the sites surveyed in the pescadero basin by esa in 2004 were found to provide adequate habitat for salmonid spawning and rearing including suitable spawning gravels frequent pools good riparian forest growth a favorable population of benthic macroinvertebrates and adequate water quality (especially temperature) and flows the highest quality salmonid habitat observed was found in the upper pescadero basin including the upper mainstem of pescadero creek and in the following tributary streams: tarwater creek peters creek slate creek and oil creek remediating these two fish passage barriers will provide unfettered access to the upper mainsteam and tributaries. the esa work in 2004 and the 2010 nmfs draft ccc coho recovery plan both focus on the primary limiting factors with regards to salmonid habitat in the watershed as a lack of deep pool habitat limited amounts and frequency of large woody debris and relatively high levels of fine sediments. the design approach for remediating both of these barriers was baseds on both passage criteria as well as the ability to recreate more natural geomorphic conditions upstream and downstream of the crossings to help create and maintain gravel beds for salmonid spawning. channel complexity that is necessary to create and sustain high quality spawning habitat will be enhanced through these projects by allowing more natural geomorphic processes to shape the channel (i.e. removing unnatural grade control and constrictions) and by removing the perceived need to remove lwd for protection of instream structures (i.e. county parks will no longer need to removal lwd to project the dam and the crossing).rearing benefits: esa in its 2004 watershed assessment also found the same factors that applied to limiting creation of high quality spawning habitat and suggested these were also limiting rearing habitat. these limiting factors are likely to have a greater significance for coho salmon than steelhead based on the life history and environmental plasticity to each species. coho in particular require deep pools with low water velocities and adequate cover for survival and growth while steelhead are more adapted to occupying and foraging in the faster and shallower areas of stream channels . the lack of deep sheltered pools and undercut banks in the reaches surveyed for the 2004 study and in preparation for the design work for both passage projects indicates that there is little suitable rearing habitat for coho salmon in and around the project reaches. the best salmonid rearing habitat is again within the upper pescadero basin including the upper mainstem of pescadero creek. remediating the fish passage barriers on the mainstem of the pescadero at the project sites will help to open access to coho to better rearing habitat. as such this project will allow rearing juveniles unfettered access to higher quality rearing habitat upstream as well as create conditions for deeper pools cover and velocity refuge to develop in the areas directly upstream and downstream of the passage projects. moreover the current climate change models and redwood response models predict reduced summer baseflows flashier winter high flows and reduced redwood canopy and fog capture in lower elevation coastal redwood forests. since species recovery is a long-term effort and must account for these potential changes juvenile access to upstream summer rearing habitat is likely to become even more critical as our climate continues to change. also the bed upstream of these features is relatively flat and wide the flow is generally shallow with few relatively shallow pools and there is an almost complete lack of cover and woody debris. these conditions are partly due to sediment that has deposited in behind the dam and created a wide flat low-gradient channel.fish passage benefits: the esa 2004 study found that pescadero creek below loma mar provides moderate quality spawning and rearing habitat and that these reaches were most important as a migration corridors. fish passage modeling was conducted at both sites to determine current passage limitations for juvenile and adult fish. for the dam removal project passage data were reviewed by the iwrp tac and the current design developed collaboratively with dfg (with specific technical oversight by marcin whitman) and nmfs to ensure that dfg passage design criteria were met for a large range of flows and were hydraulically similar to \"natural\" conditions in adjacent reference reaches. the current barrier is approximately 1 to 3 feet tall depending on the flow and tailwater condition. the vertical drop of the dam is highest during low flows and can be drown out during very high flow conditions. it is generally believed that upstream migrating adult salmonids (especially steelhead which most regional models are based on) can pass the dam. juveniles or younger fish however most likely cannot pass the up to 3-foot jump that can exist at the dam. the plunge pool at the base of the dam provides favorable conditions for jumping but the top of the dam is broad and flat and the shallow high-velocity flow creates difficult landing conditions for upstream migrating juveniles. the habitat conditions upstream of the dam are poor. the juvenile salmonids passage criteria specified in the cdfg culvert criteria for fish passage (2002) were used to design the dam removal cross section size and shape. these criteria are the following:1. maximum average velocity of 1 foot per second with roughness features and velocity shelters (orachievement of conditions similar to the channel upstream and downstream)2. minimum depth of 0.5 foot at low design flow3. low design flow = 95-percent exceedance flow and4. high design flow = 10-percent exceedance flow.the low and high passage design flows are 1.1 and 69 cfs respectively. hydraulic conditions for each of these flows were evaluated using a hec-ras model of the post-project conditions. the hec-ras outputs indicate the post-project velocity over the dam is approximately: 0.3 ft/s the low design flow (1.1 cfs) approximately 2.0 ft/s at the high design flow (69 cfs) and 1.0 ft/s at a discharge of 20 cfs. although 2.0 ft/s exceeds the design criteria for juvenile salmonids it should be noted that the predicted velocities downstream of the pool below the dam are substantially higher than they are at the dam. additionally the level of the notch is 1 foot lower than the minimum expected water surface elevation in the pool downstream and thus is backwatered to reduce velocities and provide a continuous passage route for fish. again marcin whitman has reviewed these findings and the site conditions and written an official letter of approval for the project.for the sequoia flats crossing the target species are also coho and steelhead with an emphasis on juvenile movement. because the crossing is overtopped during typical wintertime base flow the fundamental goal of the project was to provide juvenile movement during low flow stages reduce difficulties for entering the structure reduce maintenance and clogging issues and provide a better all around fish passage conditions for the structure. the project was design to meet juvenile fish passage criteria from 3 cfs and a maximum of 20 cfs. above 200 cfs and the structure is overtopped and fish passage is no longer needed through the structure. the structure is being replaced for several reasons; first the invert of the low flow opening/fish passage is high and as a result the structure has trapped sediment and degraded bed morphology conditions for approximately 600 feet upstream and second the current fish way structure is in disrepair clogs easily and is restricts juvenile passage during the low flow months. also the slope of the structure general increases downstream. this accelerates flow and creates a jump into the structure at low flows for juvenile fish. the current velocities exceed juvenile passage criteria of 1 ft/sec throughout the structure. the structure can carry approximately 35 cfs before it over tops the concrete roadway. adults can utilize the fishway at up 30 cfs but the entrance and the lower 20 feet or so of the structure has high velocities that are near or slightly exceed the cdfg passage criteria at these flows.in summary implementation of these two projects will provide vastly improved passage conditions for juveniles will all unfettered passage for adults and will facilitate more natural geomorphic processes upstream and downstream of the existing structures -- potentially creating improved local rearing conditions.

"corte madera bayfront flood protection and wetlands restoration project ","the project seeks to integrate habitat and flood protection for properties along the corte madera bayfront. it will restore historic tidal marsh and enhance seasonal wetlands in order to provide habitat for endangered and migratory species. it will provide flood protection for the commercial/industrial/residential area of larkspur east of highway 101 and improve storm water runoff in that area. ","marin ","37.93891772986292-122.51163482666016 ","5/1/13 ","9/1/14 ","wetlands and elevated properties east of the north south rr right of way in corte madera and extending north around the portion of larkspur which is east of highway 101 and west of the rr right of way. ","the area of larkspur in need of flood protection presently has flooding related to storms and high tides with the water coming in from the bay and corte madera creek. preventing high tides from entering this area will also allow the storm water runoff to be redirected from direct return into the bay to existing retention ponds. two disadvantaged communities reside in this area. both are mobile home facilities with perhaps 150+ permanent residents. the habitat restoration component of the project result in a significant increase in the tidal marshes along corte madera bay that before diking and filling extended for many miles up corte madera creek. ","the corte madera bay west of the smart rr right of way includes the corte madera ecological reserve which is one of the most important remaining tidal marshes in the bay. this shallow bay is also the location where there has been extensive filling and development of historic tidal marshes. what remains is a mix of developed uses along with important wildlife habitat especially the corte madera ecological reserve that protects 100 acres of historic tidal marsh and supports a core population of endangered california clapper rails. this reserve also includes 300 acres of formerly diked but restored tidal marsh. several areas outside of the reserve boundary are included in this project because they have been degraded by past filling and diking. the largest is a 72 acre site owned by the ggbhtd that is currently seasonal wetlands and ruderal lands on which there is a massive invasion of non-native pampas grass. an adjoining 5 acre parcel currently is in private hands had previously been proposed as office space and/or housing. there has been a recent appraisal and the current owner is in discussions with marin audubon society regarding the sale of this property. the rr right of way currently owned by smart is the west boundary of the property. there are several trails on the properties used for recreational purposes . the ggbhtd wishes to use the majority of this 72 acre site as mitigation for projects it has planned at several of their ferry terminals. the result of both restorations would be to provide improved habitat for the endangered california clapper rail as well as local shorebirds and migratory species. water quality in the bay would be improved by expanding the wetlands and improve the health of fish in the bay as well as providing for carbon sequestration. it would also help with flood protection for the communities that lie west of the rr right of way by providing a transitional zone of wetlands which buffer storm surges. ultimately the marin audubon society will make sure the grant is utilized to restore the marsh and then it will be turned over to fish & game for oversight. the communities of corte madera and larkspur west of the the elevated rr right of way depend on the levee for flood protection from high tides and sea level rise. there has been settlement of the levee and the communities need the levee to be reinforced to provide protection in the future. the residential/commercial/industrial properties of larkspur which are east of 101 are also at risk from high tides in the corte madera creek. a detailed engineering study in 1998 was performed by an west (industrial way/lucky drive flood control project) but never implemented. this project included improving the levees and creating a flood barrier inboard from corte madera creek to protect two disadvantaged communities of permanently installed mobile homes as well as the many businesses also located on this site. removing the periodic high tide flooding which impacts this area would also result in storm water runoff going into retention ponds rather than flowing directly into the bay. ","sea level rise with high tides have impacted areas of corte madera and larkspur over the past twenty years. the situation is worse due to subsidence of the land and more homes are at risk of flooding in the future. this project would protect those homes and businesses located west of the levee and east of 101 that are currently subject to flooding from high tides and storm water runoff. it would prevent water quality issues from deteriorating due to oil and other industrial materials being captured in storm waters that inundate homes and businesses in this area. the storm water runoff would be pumped into adjoining retention ponds to allow settlement of any noxious materials before the water is pumped into the bay. the residential area in question is a disadvantaged low income community consisting of two permanent mobile home communities with a population of 150+ individuals. reinforcing the north south levee and adding wetlands that can dampen the effect of high tides and storm surges will also help to protect all communities west of the levee and the currently degraded lands will be restored to viable wetlands for improved wildlife habitat. the restored wetlands will also act as a transition zone for sea level rise. this will expand the wetlands adjoining the corte madera ecological reserve and will improve habitat for the endangered california clapper rail as well as shorebirds migratory waterfowl and anadromous fish. this project will expand and enhance one of the largest wetlands in southern marin by restoring the currently diked and degraded historic baylands. ","the need to restore and expand existing wetlands will not occur and the ability of wetlands to support endangered species shorebirds and other migratory birds will be diminished. wetlands are needed to help remove toxins from the bay and expanding wetlands to accomplish this goal should be a high priority. wetlands will not be expanded to act as a sponge to help clean the bay support a healthy fish population and increase carbon sequestration. if the project is not implemented opportunities to expand the habitat for endangered species will not occur reducing the chance for recovery of the endangered california clapper rail. the current corte madera ecological reserve marshes provide critical habitat for this species and is described in the usfws recovery plan for tidal marshes as a core central bay population of clapper rails. the existing habitat is threatened by urban uses and uncontrolled access. this project would improve recreational access and expansion of the tidal marsh which will improve the recovery potential for this endangered species. flooding problems in corte madera and larkspur will increase with subsidence of properties and sea level rise will increase their vulnerability to flooding. if flood protection is not provided there will be increased storm water runoff of oil and other toxins found on streets yards and in business or industrial sites ","flooding causes water damage as well as exposure to oil biological waste and toxins that the flood waters pick up as they spread. preventing residential homes and businesses from being inundated with flood waters as well as toxins will prevent exposure to potentially harmful flood waters. this will protect the existing water system from being compromised by the flood waters. currently storm water runoff goes directly into corte madera creek or the sf bay by providing flood protection the storm water runoff will first go into retention ponds for settlement before being pumped into the bay. by improving the levees and creating a flood barrier the larkspur community will be protected from future flooding and sea level rise. expanding wetlands will buffer the levee and lands from storm surges and high tides which will provide enhanced flood protection. material removed from the sites can be used to restore the levee to fema standards where the material will not impact wetlands. this will expand one of the largest wetlands along the southern marin shore and help restore the health of the bay as well as providing improved habitat for the endangered california clapper rail migratory waterfowl and native shorebirds. creating transitions/buffer zones will also help with flood protection and provide high tide refuge habitat for the clapper rail. expanded wetlands will improve the health and the fish population of the bay. trails will be environmentally sensitive and maintained along the levees for recreational purposes and several observation sites may be created for viewing the shorebirds and migratory species.

","the project improves water quality by keeping watershed headwaters as well-managed open space. erosion and sediment flow issues will be minimized through assessment and future implementation of erosion control projects. the acquisition will improve stormwater flow rates under i-80 culverts and downstream in american canyon creek by protecting and preserving broad floodplains and wetlands on the property. habitats on the property will be protected by preservation of the property in perpetuity by the solano land trust. the project envisions watershed and resource assessments that result in designing future enhancement projects for wetlands riparian corridors raptors and native grasslands. the property has easy access to local bike paths (mcgary road between the city of vallejo and city of fairfield) and the regional hiking trail the bay area ridge trail. the city of vallejo is a disadvantaged community and planned public access on this property has the potential to be well used by citizens of this community because it is only a few miles to the north. ","the project has two phases the first phase is the acquisition of the property and the second phase is assessment of watershed health and resources and planning public access. solano land trust (slt) has partnered with solano county to receive federal earmark funds for the purchase of open space with potential development of trails. these parcels proposed for purchase known as the brown-souza properties located in southwestern solano county were selected because of willing sellers and their location adjacent to two existing open spaces: lynch canyon (solano county) and newell open space (napa county). the properties are scenic grasslands with ridgeline views of san pablo bay cities of vallejo and napa and inland hills. they contain areas of native grasslands riparian waterways and freshwater wetlands. the acquisition has an 80% match committed through federal funds and we are seeking the remaining 20% match with this application. resource assessment is an essential part of future management of the property for open space. for the brown-souza properties slt is proposing a watershed assessment similar to that completed at the adjacent lynch canyon for the purpose of prioritizing watershed health enhancements such exclusion fencing for riparian areas and springs designing and implementing erosion control projects and restoring native grasslands freshwater wetlands and riparian areas. the watershed assessment will survey creek sections evaluate stream hydrology map native vegetation and invasive plants and prioritize problem areas where the creek is undersized unstable or without cover. resource assessment will inventory the plant communities and wildlife evaluate hydrology and geomorphology and assess the areas habitat potential. the watershed work will designate areas on the property that have the potential to restore habitat for sensitive species such as the california red-legged frog or nesting raptors and evaluate the potential to partner with the solano county habitat conservation plan. slt will complete the watershed and resource assessment prior to planning public access infrastructure so that impacts to sensitive areas are avoided or minimized. public access is active at the adjacent lynch canyon and is administered by solano county parks department. pursuant to amending our agreement that agency will also administer access on these new parcels. the trail network at lynch canyon could link to trails that will be planned at these new parcels. this network could provide an essential link to the bay area ridge trail. access to the brown-souza parcels is from an existing i-80 freeway frontage road at the american canyon road exit. ","this project is a combination acquisition and watershed assessment project. when federal funding became available for acquisition of open space with trails the solano land trust (slt) was contacted to be the potential owner and operator of this property for public open space. solano county is the only county in the bay area that does not have a regional park district to acquire open space for preservation and recreational purposes. slt functions in solano county to purchase and maintain open space in trust for the public. however because slt is a private non-profit we do not have a source of funding for acquisition and must seek outside funding to do so. this requested funding will match the 80% exiting funding and also provide funds to implement public access in a manner that preserves and protects the watershed and its resources. the project benefits are many including: watershed protection riparian habitat enhancement agriculture and public access available on the property in a manner that does not impact resources and implementation of regional plans for open space in the county. the addition of these 275 acres adds to the adjacent 1000-acre lynch canyon space and the 640-acre newell open space for a total of 1915-acres of open space that will eventually be open to the public. ","if the project is not implemented slt will have to seek funding from other sources or lose this opportunity to purchase this land and add to existing open space property. the citizens of solano county would lose the opportunity for this key purchase. there are not many sources of acquisition funding to match federal funds at this time. ","i. water supply the project will protect 275-acres of upper watershed lands that drain into suisun bay. the project will provide in perpetuity protection and management of upper watershed lands. the solano land trust will assess these lands for resource protection and prioritize erosion control and sediment flow issues in these ephemeral drainage for remedies. in perpetuity management will protect water quality through grazing management public access management and periodic watershed health assessments. protection and managing the upper watershed to include vegetated riparian buffers and creek floodplains will decrease flood risks downstream. the acquisition of the 275-acre project area by the county/solano land trust partnership will preserve the area in perpetuity for open space. the land protected adds to existing protected lands thus increasing its value for watershed habitat and recreation. the project will provide the baseline for watershed management through assessment of watershed health and resources within one year of purchase. the project will provide outdoor low-impact recreational opportunities to nearby disadvantaged communities. up to 5 miles of trails may be planned on these parcels. the trail connections to the bay area ridge trail on the adjacent open space is important to create linkage in this network. the project will provide wildlife habitat enhancement including that for: california red-legged frogs and other wetland species; raptors including golden eagles and other raptor species that are both resident and migratory; and nesting grassland birds. the project will protect water quality by defining vegetative buffers to riparian corridors freshwater wetlands and springs. the project will increase stewardship opportunities by providing projects for local volunteer groups and schools as well as tours for visitors to highlight the importance of our local wildlife and vegetation to the larger watershed systems. the site has the potential to develop increased environmental education due to its proximity to local cities.

","this project will increase infiltration improve water quality and increase the capacity of ground water recharge through the use of bioretention planter areas along bolinas avenue. this project will improve the existing storm drain system and add flood protection by increasing the storm drain capacity along bolinas avenue and divert a significant portion of stormwater runoff (30% or more) to fernhill creek away from the storm drain system. the restoration of fernhill creek would help restore historical riparian habitat to the area. ","this project includes three elements related to storm water quality and drainage: over the years fernhill creek has been piped filled in fenced and otherwise obstructed making the creek ineffective for stormwater conveyance. many of the homeowners have installed pumps that pump water onto bolinas avenue contributing to the flooding that occurs. other stormwater that should have entered fernhill creek at the west end of bolinas avenue also appears to have been diverted by streets and storm drains to bolinas avenue. one of the project goals is to restore historic flows to fernhill creek so that storm flows on bolinas avenue will be reduced. this will also have the potential to increase the infiltration of water and improve water quality. it may also be possible to increase bioretention on fernhill creek if property owners are willing to allow it. grant money would be used to restore the creek increase restrictive culverts and introduce bioretention opportunities.make bolinas avenue a green street by creating bioretention in the planter strip areas along the street which will increase stormwater infiltration decrease flows and improve water quality. there may be opportunities to increase bio-retention and reduce impervious surfaces by replacing on-street parking with bio-retention ponds.based on the hydrology and hydraulic analyses completed to date and the limited capacity of fernhill creek (even after restoration) a new culvert system will be needed on bolinas avenue to alleviate the flooding in the vicinity of the richmond road and bolinas avenue intersection. without diversions to fernhill creek a culvert system of 48-inch and 54-inch culverts would be required to convey the 69 cubic feet per second to corte madera creek at the downstream side of the sir francis drake boulevard bridge south of bolinas avenue. if flows can be restored to fernhill creek it is anticipated there will be a 30% reduction in the flows along bolinas avenue. ","bolinas avenue has had flooding problems spanning several decades. a preliminary hydrology and hydraulics study of bolinas avenue verified that the existing stormwater system is severely undersized a problem that primarily was caused by the diversion of water from fernhill creek onto bolinas avenue. this project targets the flooding problems on bolinas avenue while also improving stormwater quality and restoring historic stream flow which will in turn improve water quality reduce flooding and improve habitat values. ","the intersection of bolinas avenue and richmond road will continue to flood causing: water to flood buildings and introduce contaminants into the surface watersflooding of the sewer system introducing raw sewage and potentially deadly bacteria into surface watersobstruction of pedestrian access on a school routetraffic delays on a school and emergency vehicle route. ","the addition of bio-retention areas on bolinas avenue would slow stormwater down filtering the stormwater and allowing for greater infiltration. this will improve both the capacity and quality of groundwater in the area. by adding bio-retention areas along bolinas avenue a portion of the stormwater runoff will be filtered before entering the storm drain system thereby improving water quality. the existing storm drain system is severely undersized. this project would simultaneously increase the capacity of the storm drain system and divert a significant portion of stormwater runoff (30% or more) to fernhill creek away from the storm drain system. the restoration of fernhill creek would help restore historical riparian habitat to the area.

","this project will help to ensure a reliable drinking water supply for pescadero residents within csa 11. a study conducted in 2001 by todd engineers hypothesized that the shallow configuration of the current csa 11 drinking water wells causes a localized drop in aquifer water levels. drilling a deeper well at a lower elevation will allow water to be extracted more reliably and efficiently without increasing the amount of groundwater extracted. the additional storage tank will increase the capacity of the water system to continue providing adequate water supply in the event of an emergency. water conservation efforts will help to protect groundwater resources within csa 11's drinking water aquifer located on a ridge one mile west of the town. water conservation will also benefit water quality within the alluvial aquifer located directly beneath the town by reducing discharge from septic systems. the population of csa 11 users have a median household income (mhi) of less than 80% of the state mhi potentially qualifying them as a disadvantaged community. ","the county of san mateo department of public works and parks (county) proposes to construct a new municipal water well and storage tank for the purpose of extending the life of the drinking water supply and providing adequate emergency response for the county service area 11 (csa 11) water system (also known as the pescadero community water system) which serves approximately 100 households within the town of pescadero (town). the new well and storage tank would be installed on a parcel currently owned by the county in the vicinity of two existing csa 11 water supply wells located approximately one mile west of the town in unincorporated san mateo county california. the current water supply system is estimated to last from zero (0) to four (4) additional years. the project would provide better access to the groundwater aquifer that was identified to provide sufficient storage to supply the community and would not increase the amount of extracted groundwater. the county will be responsible for maintenance and monitoring of the pescadero water system including the new municipal water well and tank. additional measures will be implemented to ensure a safe and reliable water supply system. the new 140000 gallon storage tank would be installed adjacent to the existing storage tank. the installation of the new well would consist of an approximately 16-inch diameter well hole drilled to a depth of 100 feet below mean sea level in order to intercept a deeper portion of the pigeon point formation aquifer. upon completion of the well installation pumping tests would be conducted to determine appropriate pumping rates and target efficiency. a permanent pump small pump house and connections to the existing storage tanks would then be installed. the well pump and associated monitoring equipment would be contained within a small pump house located over or immediately adjacent to the well head. an underground water transmission line would be constructed to deliver water from the well to the storage tanks. electrical power for operation of the pump would be taken from the existing overhead electrical distribution lines at the storage tanks. in addition the county proposes to use grant funding to initiate a water conservation program for the pescadero community served by csa 11. given the low-income status of csa 11 households the county is planning to provide residents with low- or no-cost high efficiency toilet and washer replacement options. additional water saving measures may include low flow faucet and shower heads and rainwater harvesting devices. traditional rebate programs can exclude low-income communities from participating in water efficiency replacement programs where residents cannot afford to invest in a new toilet or washer and then wait as long as 8 weeks to be issued rebates. therefore the county intends to recruit local community-based organizations (cbos) to assist the county in management of the toilet and washer replacement program. the county and/or cbos may perform the following tasks: public outreach and education efforts; household surveys to determine number of qualifying items needed; purchase warehouse and distribute new items; and dispose of old items appropriately. funding for the replacement program may be provided to the cbos up-front if the terms of the grant allow it. local plumbers would be recruited to perform installations and post-installation monitoring. ","prior to 1993 the town's supply of drinking water depended on small domestic wells water from surface impoundments and locally derived groundwater from wells installed in the alluvial aquifer of pescadero and butano creeks. in the 1970's and 1980's these sources were found to contain relatively high concentrations of nitrate and other naturally occurring salts. this situation prompted the development of an alternative groundwater source located near the top of a hill one mile west of the town. two wells (one test well and one municipal water well) have been the town's source of drinking water and fire protection since 1993. in april 2001 the county retained an engineering consultant to assess the long-term reliability of the water source for the town's water system. the assessment concluded that based on the current pumping rate the existing wells would fail in 8 to 15 years estimating failure to occur between 2009 and 2016 (todd engineers 2002). the report hypothesized that the shallow configuration of the current wells causes a localized drop in aquifer water levels. the consultant recommended installation of a new municipal water well in the vicinity of the existing wells. drilling a deeper well at a lower elevation will allow water to be extracted more reliably and efficiently without increasing the amount of groundwater extracted. installation of a new municipal water well would extend the life of csa 11's water supply to at least 38 years. installation of an additional storage tank will increase the capacity of the water system to continue providing adequate water supply in the event of an emergency. implementation of a water conservation program will further reduce water supply demand and help achieve the ultimate goal of a sustainable water supply system. ","if a new deeper municipal water supply well is not constructed for the csa 11 water system the existing water supply wells could fail temporarily or permanently due to the localized drop in aquifer levels. an engineering assessment conducted in 2001 estimated failure to occur between 2009 and 2016 (todd engineers 2002). permanent well failure would result in the need to find an alternate source of water which could require drilling of new wells in other areas water treatment and/or long distance distribution line installation and maintenance. the second storage tank would increase the capacity of the water system to continue providing adequate water supply in the event of an emergency such as pump failure natural disaster or major fire. water shortages or outages due to inadequate water supply would result in the need for bottled water delivery boil water notices and the temporary closure of local businesses. ","installation of a new municipal water well would extend the life of csa 11's water supply to at least 38 years. installation of an additional water storage tank would increase the capacity of the water system to continue providing adequate water supply in the event of an emergency. implementation of a water conservation program will further reduce water supply demand and help achieve the ultimate goal of a sustainable water supply system. the estimated quantity of water used by csa 11 is approximately 25 acre-feet per year. installation of 120 high efficiency toilets and 80 high efficiency washers could result in an annual total water savings of 4 acre-feet or a 16% reduction in water use. water conservation efforts will benefit water quality within the alluvial aquifer located directly beneath the town of pescadero by reducing discharge from septic systems. na na ","county of san mateo department of public works and parks ","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","0"

","the grayson creek channel was constructed in the 1960s by federal partners (usace and nrcs) and is generally a wide trapezoidal earthen channel. it's location near the bottom of the watershed means that the channel is slow moving and sediment deposition is common. the channel requires periodic sediment removal to maintain flood capacity. the last comprehensive sediment removal project was in 2006 and the next is anticipated to be needed around 2016. in 2006 the disposal of the material was challenging. the 32000 cy of material ended up going to a local park that was making a large wildlife viewing mound. ideally the material would go to a project that is creating wetlands or adjusting marsh elevations to accommodate sea level rise. this project will remove approximately 35000 cy of accumulated sediment in grayson creek at selected locations between it's confluence with walnut creek and chilpancingo parkway a distance of about 9000 lf . sediment would be removed from specific selected areas based on the channel cross section and the habitat type affected. generally the sediment is removed from areas mapped as uplands and wetlands typically establish in the now lower area once the sediment has been removed. because grayson creek is dynamic and sediment moves downstream each season the exact areas to be desilted will be determined by a topographic survey and wetland delineation closer to construction. the work is typically accomplished in the dry using traditional and long reach excavators working either from the adjacent channel maintenance road or from upland areas on the channel floodplain bench. the material is deposited directly into waiting trucks for offhaul and disposal (or ideally reuse). ","historically before development of the adjacent floodplain with residential and commercial uses grayson creek would periodically flood and deposit its sediment load on its broad floodplain. this improved the quality of the soils and kept the channel in balance. unfortunately the development of the floodplain in the mid 20th century meant that the floodwaters (and the sediment) needed to stay within the creek. flooding the neighborhood wasn't an option. the creek was channelized requiring periodic removal of the accumulated sediment. this project is also needed to prevent the seasonal wetlands present on the channel bottom from turning into uplands as more and more sediment is dumped on them. the sediment removal process (or 'desilting') will restore the design level of flood protection and will also restore wetlands that have been lost due to the natural deposition of sediments. this project is needed to restore proper function to grayson creek. ","if the proposal is not implemented grayson creek channel will be undersized to handle large flood events and the surrounding areas will be exposed to increased flood risk. wetland areas in the channel will continue to be inundated with sediment and convert into uplands. ","the remove of sediment from the channel will return the channel to its design capacity to reduce flood risk for the areas near the creek the removal of sediment from the channel will return upland areas to higher value wetlands.

","general project concept - the city of hayward recycled water project has been developed to increase the citys water supply portfolio and to reduce its reliance on sfpuc regional water system. the proposed project involves the construction of 1.5 miles of distribution lines to the north and south of the hayward water pollution control facility (wpcf) rehabilitation and connections to an existing shell oil pipeline over three miles of customer laterals to 24 customers and installation of customer connections and retrofits. the project would deliver an estimated average of 260000 gpd or 290 afy of recycled water for cooling towers boiler feed and irrigation. the city also anticipates utilizing excess tertiary treated recycled water from the russell city energy center a 600 megawatt electrical energy generation facility located adjacent to the wpcf. project construction and implementation - distribution from the wpcf will be through two parallel 8-inch main pipelines to serve the north and south branches of whitesell road. the south branch will serve a cluster of recycled water customers in the area between the wpcf and highway 92. the north branch will connect to the existing shell oil pipeline (8-inch) which will be rehabilitated for water use. flow through the shell oil pipeline will split to customers on the north and south ends of the pipeline. connections will be made into the shell oil pipeline for 6-inch laterals to a single customer or customer grouping. these customer laterals vary from a few yards to three quarters of a mile. the city is pursuing an agreement with shell oil to purchase the abandoned 8-inch diameter pipeline that could form the backbone of the distribution system. in the event that an agreement with shell oil is not reached city will construct its own 8-inch recycled water pipeline. treatment methods - the tertiary treated facilities at russell city energy center include filtration (pretreatment using incline plate clarifiers and granular media filtration) and chlorination. if the city constructs its own treatment facility the process train at the planning level is expected to include filtration (pretreatment using flocculating clarifier and granular media filtration) and chlorination. this process train will be finalized during design. key benefits to the city: (1) economic growth and development - provides water for non-potable industrial uses and supports redevelopment of industrial areas near wpcf (2) diversifying water sources - provides 290 afy of locally-controlled drought-proof water supply for non-potable sources and reduces dependence on sfpuc imported water (3) environmental protection - reduces mass loading of regulated constituents to san francisco bay (4) sustainability - conserves potable water for its highest uses and beneficial re-use of an existing city-owned resource. potential benefits to other stakeholders : (1) sfpuc/bawsca - reduces demand on sfpuc imported water system (2) swrcb - assists in meeting statewide recycled water targets and extends stae water supply with 290 afy of drought-proof non-potable water regional coordination - the project is included in the 2013 bay area irwmp. ","dependence on sfpuc regional water system - the city of hayward water system serves a community of about 147000 residents industrial and office parks commercial areas golf courses recreational parks an airport schools college and a state university. the city receives 100% of its water supply from the san francisco public utilities commission (sfpuc) which consists predominantly of snowmelt from the sierra nevada mountains and is delivered through the hetch hetchy aqueducts. hayward shares its sole water supply with 25 other wholesale customers as well as the city of san francisco. although hayward's contract with sfpuc does not include a cap on water deliveries the sfpuc has limited average water deliveries to wholesale customers to 184 mgd collectively at least through 2018. development of additional water recycling conservation and groundwater projects is proposed to bridge the potential gap between demand and supply. the hayward recycled water project would offset the demand for up to 290 afy of potable water. water supply reliability - the majority of sfpuc water supplies are susceptible to drought conditions which could result in significant reductions in available water supply in dry years. the city's present water supplies are also vulnerable to service disruptions due to earthquakes and other such events. the project would provide up to 290 afy of locally produced drought-proof water supply. wastewater discharge - the city currently supplies calpine with between 2 and 4 million gallons per day of treated wastewater with the remaining flow and its associated mass loadings of regulated consituents discharged to the san francisco bay. the project would reduce discharges of secondary treated effluent and its associated constituents to the bay. resource stewardship - water supplies to the sfpuc regional water system result in diversions from the tuolumne river which may impact flow conditions and the natural habitat within the river. ","if the recycled water project is not constructed the city will remain 100 percent dependent on sfpuc water supplies as this supply faces increasing pressure and competition. the city's supply may also be impacted during drought and service disruptions due to earthquake and other catastrophic events. in addition the city will continue to discharge all of its treated effluent (except that portion used by calpine) to san francisco bay which is listed as an impaired water body due to high levels of toxic substances in water and sediment. ","water supply - this project will provide water supply diversification and reliability. hayward is currently dependent on sfpuc for 100% of the the city's water supply. while the city has no contractual cap on its water purchases the sfpuc has imposed an interim supply allocation at least through 2018. the hayward recycled water project has been developed to offset sfpuc purchases by up to 290 afy. the project will supplement potable water demands and to the extent possible make drinking water quality supplies available for higher level purposes. hayward's current supply is also vulnerable to drought conditions and service disruptions due to earthquakes. the project would dampen the impact of reductions brought on by these occurrences and allow for the use of a reliable locally produced and drought-proof supply. water quality - the city currently discharges treated wastewater to san francisco bay in accordance with an ndpes permit. the use of recycled water would decrease mass loadings of regulated constituents to san francisco bay by reducing effluent flow. the discharge of secondary treated wastewater to the san francisco bay would be reduced by 290 afy improving the water quality in this body of water. n/a resource stewardship - the hayward recycled water project could reduce diversions from the tuolumne river by 290 afy an environmentally sensitive waterway benefiting the natural river habitat and improving the flow conditions.

","in 2009 the san francisco bay regional water quality control board (rwqcb) adopted a basin plan amendment establishing tmdls for sediment in the sonoma creek and in the napa river and an implementation plan to achieve tmdls and related habitat enhancement goals for the two water bodies. the state water resources control board subsequently adopted the basin plan amendments in 2010. the basin plans were amended due to the decline of steelhead and salmon populations in the napa river and sonoma creek as a result of high concentrations of fine sediment. four significant categories of human-caused sediment sources have been identified: roads vineyards rangelands and channel incision/bank erosion. subsequently the rwqcb has drafted waivers of waste discharge requirements (waiver) for vineyards and completed a waiver for ranch properties. ranch property owners and managers are currently completing farm plans to comply with the ranch waiver and those plans will be complete by november 2012. southern sonoma rcd napa county rcd uc cooperative extension and nrcs are currently assisting grazing managers with completion of their ranch water quality plans. in order to comply with the waiver for vineyards an eligible vineyard landowner/operator shall complete a comprehensive vineyard water quality farm plan (farm plan) by march 31 2014. the landsmart program assists vineyard and ranch managers with developing farm plans in compliance with the waivers. in both instances the resulting farm plans will identify specific water quality and habitat enhancement projects. the farm plans will be a comprehensive inventory and assessment of natural resources facility condition and management practices at a given property. the inventory and assessment is intended to assess and document existing management practices and guide a strategy for implementing additional management practices and projects that are designed to prevent the discharge of pollutants to surface waters. management practices and implementation projects must address all potential sources of pollutants on the vineyard property including: road runoff and erosion surface erosion chemical and fertilizer applications excessive storm runoff and sediment delivery from sites such as gullies rills and landslides. the farm plan must also evaluate and identify opportunities to implement management practices and/or retrofit vineyard property drainage facilities to promote infiltration prevent increases in peak storm runoff and promote enhancement of multiple beneficial uses (including aquatic habitat) to meet all waiver standards. the proposed project will provide funding to assist landowners with implementing the management practices and projects identified in their landsmart farm plans. at present the rcds have funds to assist with farm assessment and planning but no funding assistance for implementing such work on private properties is limited. ","if some level of public funding is not available to assist land managers with implementing expensive but pollution-reducing projects identified in their farm plans there is a risk that land managers will not have sufficient funding to implement projects in a timely manner to prevent sediment delivery and improve habitat. this will put aquatic habitat at risk of continued degradation over a more extended period of time. ","this project will improve quality by implementing sediment-delivery reducing projects identified in landsmart farm plans for vineyards and ranches in the napa river sonoma creek and petaluma river watersheds. typical projects include improvements to rural road systems that contribute fine sediment to waterways through chronic and episodic processes enhancement of riparian habitat and implementation of practices of treatments to control sediment delivery from rills gullies and landslides (when practical). most if not all of these practices are carried out in a way that is sensitive to climate change and climate adaptation. this project will attenuate storm waters and peak storm flows in creeks by implementing projects that disperse water across landscapes rather than concentrate flows. examples include detention systems and level spreaders. by working directly with land managers and actively engaging them in the process of planning for (and maintaining) water quality and habitat improvement projects resource stewardship on private lands is improved. land managers will actively engage in reducing sediment delivery to the napa river sonoma creek and petaluma river watersheds and improving aquatic habitat in the three watersheds. additionally the project will promote best management practices among land owners and land managers via workshops and volunteer stewardship events.

"miller avenue green street plan ","over the last three years the city of mill valley has planned improvements for the community's main gateway miller avenue. the project plans to renovate the existing roadway originally constructed in the late 1800's with improved bicycle pedestrian and transit facilities for users of all ages and abilities. miller avenue will incorporate green street features including bio retention areas pervious pavement and creek day lighting designed to improve the quality of storm water runoff released to corte madera creek richardson bay and san francisco bay. ","marin county ","37.895841667 | -122.53817778 ","02/01/2013 ","05/01/2020 ","this project is located within the city of mill valley in marin county. the extent of the improvement will be along miller avenue from almonte boulevard to sunnyside avenue. ","this project will include several low impact development strategies including the construction of bio retention areas and pervious pavements capturing runoff from impervious surfaces. to facilitate future improvements to reduce the potential of flooding of corte madera creek the project will relocate existing utilities including water storm drain sanitary sewer and electrical facilities. ","the project included in this grant application incorporates over 10 years of planning by city staff community members and other stakeholders. in the early 2000s the mill valley community recognized the need to develop a plan to better balance the modes of transportation along miller avenue the communitys principal arterial corridor. following a series of studies to assess needs in 2009 the city council assembled a design advisory committee (dac) to finalize a conceptual streetscape design for miller avenue. through 2010 and 2011 the dac worked to establish goals for miller avenue review technical data and coordinate public input. the outreach process included three public meetings to present concepts discuss tradeoffs and solicit input. through this community based collaborative process the miller avenue streetscape plan identified the following goals: improve multi-modal transportation preserve and enhance ecology and landscape recognize cultural features and character and improve infrastructure. the city council adopted the streetscape plan in july 2011. the streetscape plan will reconstruct miller avenue from sunnyside avenue to almonte boulevard adding continuous bicycle lanes and widening sidewalks. recognizing that storm water runoff from miller avenue contributes to water quality in the arroyo corte madera del presidio; planners added the following elements to the project: limit new impervious surfaces by reducing asphalt and concrete pavements and install pervious pavement where possible. the projects reduction in impervious surfaces reduces peak discharge to the watershed and improves ground water recharge.install storm water best management practices such as bio retention facilities to intercept runoff from impervious surface removing pollutants prior to discharge to the watershed. the city plans to design and install these features in accordance with the marin county's stormwater pollution prevention program. experiment with alternative storm water quality features such as subterranean storm water quality blocks and evaluate their effectiveness by measuring influent and effluent. the city will employ these features in locations where pedestrian facilities are constrained by limited rights of way.recognizing the history of flooding including the 2005/06 event along miller avenue and adjacent neighborhoods relocate existing utilities and provide basic infrastructure for improvements as identified in the richardson bay watershed work plan currently being prepared by the county of marin. promote the importance of water quality by day lighting a portion of a tributary of corte madera creek at millwood street. remove invasive species from the creek. due to the size of the project and potential to cause disruption the city will phase construction likely over a five year period and in coordination with the flood control project. ","miller avenue currently has no facilities to remove pollutants from rainwater runoff to the corte madera watershed. runoff originates not only from the public street but from many of the private properties along the corridor. as this is one of the most dense portions of the community it represents a major contributor of non point source pollution originating from vehicle emissions and maintenance waste trash and pesticides. these pollutants are discharged directly to the san francisco bay. as defined in the streetscape plan the need to repair the corridor's basic infrastructure including pavement sidewalks and ramps and utility systems is great as the design life is exceeded. the city of mill valley has inadequate local funding to complete the project and is working to secure additional funds through a combination of sources including transportation authority of marin measure a sales tax and the state of california safe routes to school program. these external funding sources prescribe how the funds can be expended precluding certain project features. the city of mill valley may not have adequate local funds to completely integrate storm water quality features into the improvements of miller avenue. additional funding through the irwmp program will assist the city in creating a green street that will serve as a model for other north bay communities. ","miller avenue will be re-constructed with as many of the elements defined in the streetscape plan as funding will allow. if funding is not received through the irwmp program the city will integrate as many storm water best management practices as possible. however due to differed maintenance and competing requirements that are beyond the city's control a comprehensive storm water quality strategy many not be possible. ","flood and storm water management in its current configuration miller avenue has 19.1 acres of impervious and 4.5 acres of pervious surfaces. when complete the street will be transformed to contain 17.5 acres of impervious and 6.1 acres of pervious surfaces. approximately 1 acre of the project area will be reserved for storm water quality features limiting non source point pollution to the corte madera watershed. as mill valley receives about 38 inches of rainfall a year about 60 ac-ft of currently untreated runoff will pass through a storm water quality feature when the project is complete. the second major benefit is the project will clear utilities and other obstructions to accommodate future flood control improvements identified by the county of marin. the city and county have identified several alternative improvements which may include a bypass channel flap gates and/ or pump station. the city will coordinate the design of miller avenue with the flood control improvements. the third benefit is a section of creek will be day lighted and invasive species removed. the project will incorporate informational signage describing the importance of creeks and water quality. finally when complete this project will serve as a model for other north bay communities planning green street projects. the city will provide guidance related to balancing green and complete street components as well as solutions to challenges faced during construction. as the project begins operations the city will provide data related to maintenance and cost. while the total project cost is estimated to be $20 million storm water quality features represent about $1.8 million.

","the project will install green lid infrastructure elements (bio-swales rain gardens rain barrels erosion control structures etc.) at the marin county fire dept. headquarters (mcfdhq) and three sites on private property in the san geronimo valley. the objective of the project is to reduce run-off of contaminants and erosion of sediment into a critical coho salmon stream. the projects will also help to reduce risks of flooding during peak storm flows. the projects have been identified as priorities in the san geronimo valley landowner assistance program and address impacts related to the tmdl listing for this creek for sedimentation. as an educational benefit the project at the mcfdhq will be showcased to the public at the annual 4th of july pancake breakfast. members of the public will be recruited to participate in all projects and informed about the benefits of lid to the watershed water quality improvements are achieved by filtration of run-off through bio-swales and rain gardens. groundwater benefits are achieved by sinking stormwater run-off to recharge in-stream flows. flood protection for residents in the valley is improved by slowing down peak flows through retention infiltration and storage of run-off during winter storm events and then releasing it back into the watershed during times of low flows. green infrastructure projects on the hq property the marin county fd headquarters has approx. 1.6 acres of impervious surface. during storm events resulting runoff creates downstream erosion and habitat degradation. this community-based project integrates two main components upstream restoration and green infrastructure. education and outreach will be built into each step of the project. the hq has large roof areas and large impervious (asphalt) surfaces. a guiding principle of green infrastructure is to infiltrate water into the ground as close to its source as possible. in keeping with this approach a variety of lid strategies could be deployed at the hq including large and small rain cisterns pervious roadway dry cells and raingardens. because of the wide range of size and cost for each lid technique this project could be phased. some components will require no design drawings and approvals. others will. since the hq is county property all components have the benefit of requiring little or no county permits. the county would be the lead agency for ceqa purposes. stream restoration of the woodacre creek tributary above the hq the tributary overflows its culvert with every 5-10 year storm flooding into the hq and castle rock avenue. adjacent to the point where the creek is culverted a valley cut across the roadway would channel any stormwaters (above the capacity of the restoration) into a raingarden. this raingarden is a project of the green infrastructure component of this proposal.

","three watersheds in the north bay- sonoma creek napa river and suisun creek are primarily agricultural land and rangeland and support threatened steelhead trout. both sonoma creek and the napa river are listed as impaired by excessive fine sediment and pathogens. the napa river is also listed as impaired for nutrients. the suisun creek watershed assessment and enhancement plan and 10 years of extensive water quality monitoring call for reducing fine sediment loading and water temperatures in suisun creek (laurel marcus and associates 2004 california sportfishing protection alliance 2011). the san francisco bay basin water quality control plan shows the three waterways have the following beneficial uses: cold migr rare spwn wild rec-1 rec-2 ownership in these three watersheds is more than 90% private land. the fine sediment tmdls for sonoma creek and napa river require a reduction in surface erosion associated with vineyards of 51% and grazing lands of 81%. in the napa river drainage the tmdl requires a 51% reduction of fine sediment generated by road-related erosion a 51% reduction in sediment derived from channel erosion and a 51% reduction in sediment from human induced shallow landslides with a total annual sediment load reduction of 78000 metric tons. proposed load reductions in the sonoma creek basin are even higher. sediment is generated from numerous sources dispersed over each watershed and requires a cost effective and widespread solution. similarly implementation of the pathogen tmdl requires changes in livestock management location of water sources and livestock concentration areas and increases in filter strips and riparian corridors. addressing these pollution sources requires working closely with the managers of agricultural land and rangeland to foster widespread and long term implementation of management measures. the tmdls in the sonoma creek and napa river identify the fff program as a means for implementing water quality improvements needed to reduce pollutant loading in the waterways and as a means of protecting beneficial uses primarily salmonid habitats. the suisun creek watershed plan recommends establishing the fff program in the drainage as a tool to reduce fine sediment in suisun creek and its tributaries. this recognition comes from the comprehensive science-based approach the program uses to identify sediment sources and implement pollution prevention measures and stream habitat restoration and thus implement the state non-degradation policy for water quality. recovery of threatened steelhead trout in these three watersheds and for the napa river also chinook salmon requires both improvement of water quality such as reduced fine sediment loading as well as creek and riparian corridor restoration water conservation and supply changes and reduced chemical use. a review of the potential to restore steelhead habitats in the sf bay area rated the napa river suisun creek and sonoma creek basins amongst the top 5 watersheds (cemar 2007). with the level of private land ownership in these basins recovery of these fish species requires a high level of cooperation with growers and ranchers. this proposal would provide funding for the fish friendly farming/ fish friendly ranching (fff/ffr) environmental certification programs to be implemented on 25000 acres in three north bay watersheds (napa sonoma and suisun). the fff/ffr program was designed to improve water quality and to restore and sustain habitat for the federally listed threatened chinook salmon and steelhead trout. the fff/ffr program is a voluntary certification program for farmers and ranchers who implement land management practices that restore and sustain fish habitat on their property and improve water quality. landowners and managers enroll in the program attend 4 educational workshops on environmentally beneficial land management practices examine their property and develop a comprehensive farm/ranch plan with a fff/ffr technical staff member and implement sediment reduction and ecological restoration projects. the fff/ffr staff complete a comprehensive sediment source inventory on each site that includes roads vineyards/grazing areas service areas all sources of concentrated flow and all creeks. legacy erosion sites are also identified. chemical use is reviewed as are water supply facilities and water conservation measures. for each site identified a management measure is prescribed and then listed in the farm plan as a required action with a timeline for implementation. in addition to sediment and pathogens the fff/ffr program focuses on habitat restoration along streams. the fff/ffr program uses a geomorphic and ecological approach to stream restoration particularly incised alluvial creeks which are common in these watersheds. creeks are assessed and measured to determine geomorphic features and any ecological concerns such as invasive non native plants lack of large wood and density and width of riparian canopy are noted. restoration methods focus on setting back banks and widening riparian corridors to address the root cause of incision by reducing flow velocities and thus erosiveness while increasing floodplain area and complexity in the channel. we also review current management practices and work with the grower to eliminate those that are not conducive to natural processes such as clearing vegetation or large wood. the fff/ffr program works cooperatively with growers and ranchers to achieve a different set of practices over the entire site so that natural features and water quality are sustained. the fff/ffr program also works with owners to implement habitat restoration projects. each farm/ranch plan includes a thorough mapping of each site the detailed inventory and assessment and a list of required actions. certification is done by the three regulatory agencies: national marine fisheries service san francisco bay regional water quality control board and the county agricultural commissioner. implementation of the farm/ranch plan is then carried out and documented by annual photo monitoring and reporting. recertification occurs on a 5 year basis and the farmer/rancher must demonstrate implementation of the required actions. current agricultural waivers for napa river and sonoma creek proposed by the regional board require farm and ranch plans by nearly all landowners. these plans would cover the entire parcel the vineyard is on and require the same content that the fff/ffr program already provides. the 501 c3 nonprofit organization the california land stewardship institute (clsi) runs the fff/ffr program. the fff program started in 1997 and was adapted for the napa valley in response to requests by the napa valley vintners association napa county farm bureau napa county grapegrowers association and the sierra club. in 2011 the program expanded to rangeland and with this addition can implement the management measures needed to significantly reduce pollutant loading over large areas of the napa river sonoma creek and suisun creek watersheds. currently over half of the vineyards parcels in the napa river watershed are already enrolled in the fff program totaling over 50000 acres with 4000 acres of vineyard parcels enrolled in the sonoma creek watershed and 2000 acres of vineyard and ranch parcels enrolled in the suisun creek watershed. in the napa river watershed 90 miles of creek 18 miles of river and 256 miles of road have been assessed and had bmps applied through the fff program. in the sonoma creek watershed 8 miles of creek and 17 miles of road have been assessed and had bmps applied through the fff program. in the suisun creek watershed 7 miles of creek and over 9 miles of road have been assessed and had bmps applied through the fff program. for the 2004-2010period a detailed sediment reduction estimate was completed for sheet rill and gully erosion from roads vineyards and legacy erosion sites on certified fff sites in napa county. the implementation of management measures resulted in a source reduction of 4-6 tons/acre/year for 40951 acres of agricultural land. the fff/ffr program identifies major projects and works to bring groups of landowners along creeks or river reaches together to work cooperatively to restore habitats. one example of this is the oakville to oak knoll napa river restoration project which encompasses 9 miles of the napa river. the fff/ffr program recognizes that improved land stewardship is best accomplished through a cooperative and positive working relationship with landowners and farmers/ranchers. landowners and managers make numerous decisions regarding land management and will use improved methods if encouraged and if technical and financial assistance is available for projects. ","the napa river sonoma creek and suisun creek watersheds support populations of federally listed threatened chinook salmon and steelhead trout. in 1990 the state water board listed the napa river as being impaired by excessive fine sediment. fine sediment fills pools necessary for rearing and clogs gravels needed for spawning. recovery of these listed species requires a reduction in fine sediment in these areas. the fine sediment tmdls for the napa river and sonoma creek identify vineyards grazing land roads and creeks on private land as primary sources of fine sediment and set reductions goals for each source. individual sources in these watersheds are not identified but instead the sources are distributed throughout the drainage. to address improvements to water quality and tmdl implementation individual parcels have to be assessed and management measures applied to control erosion and sediment sources. the fff/ffr program targets non-point sources of sediment in the three watersheds on private agricultural and ranching lands and applies bmps to reduce erosion and associated sediment from entering the waterways. the tmdls for the napa river and sonoma creek identify the fff program as a method for implementation of pollutant loading reduction and tmdl implementation. ","water quality improvements will not be implemented and instream and riparian habitat improvements will not occur. the fff/ffr program is very popular with private landowners and is able to make significant changes to land management measures resulting in sustained environmental improvements. currently there are no other programs of this type or scale in these watersheds. ","as part of every farm and ranch plan water supply facilities are inventoried and inspected. if a direct diversion is used then it must be fitted with a fish screen that is compliant with nmfs regulations. the amounts of water used for irrigation and frost control are reviewed and participants are required to apply bmps to their water use including soil moisture testing prior to irrigation and use of non water alternatives for frost control if feasible. we also look at whether the water supply has a major effect on fish habitat and may recommend changes. this project would apply these management measures on 25000 acres of land. the fff/ffr staff complete a comprehensive sediment source inventory on each site that includes roads vineyards/grazing areas service areas all sources of concentrated flow and all creeks. legacy erosion sites are also identified. chemical use is reviewed. for each site identified a management measure is prescribed and then listed in the farm plan as a required action with a timeline for implementation. the fff/ffr program works cooperatively with growers and ranchers to achieve implementation of ecologically sound practices over the entire site so that natural features and water quality are sustained. all drainage systems on the property are mapped and evaluated for adequacy and erosion effects. to the extent possible infiltration of stormwater is a priority rather than installation of pipes and dispersal of water at concentrated flow outlets is required. in addition to sediment and pathogens the fff/ffr program focuses on habitat restoration along streams. the fff/ffr program uses a geomorphic and ecological approach to stream restoration particularly incised alluvial creeks which are common in these watersheds. creeks are assessed and measured to determine geomorphic features and any ecological concerns such as invasive non native plants lack of large wood and density and width of riparian canopy are noted. restoration methods focus on setting back banks and widening riparian corridors to address the root cause of incision by reducing flow velocities and thus erosiveness while increasing floodplain area and complexity in the channel. we also review current management practices and work with the grower to eliminate those that are not conducive to natural processes such as clearing vegetation or large wood. through the fff/ffr program numerous creek and river restoration projects are identified and clsi seeks additional funding to implement these in collaboration with the owners.

","the proposed project will design and permit five different shoreline approaches projects within richardson bay that demonstrate the ability of constructed natural estuarine beach systems and marsh enhancement using dredged sediments to successfully inhibit wind-wave erosion and provide flood protection under current and anticipated sea level rise conditions. we have included implementation funding for one project called the seminary shoreline project (project 2 below) to demonstrate the capability of these types of systems to protect critical infrastructure (in this case a roadway) from erosion undercutting of the roadway slope. the five proposed projects and their demonstration values are as follows: project location demonstration value 1. seminary drive shoreline tiburon construction and monitoring of the effectiveness of a constructed estuarine gravel and cobble beach berm system abate wave erosion of unconsolidated road embankment fill that is currently eroding beneath an active roadway as an alternative to conventional boulder armoring that may have greater adverse environmental impacts. 2. southeast bothin marsh shoreline mill valley ability of a constructed narrow coarse-grained marsh-fringing estuarine beach slope (composed of fine gravel coarse sand and (native sf bay) oyster shell hash) to protect a retreating wave-eroded salt marsh

conventional rock slope protection would conflict with shoreline access and existing recreational uses. micro-groins 3. lower coyote creek/west bothin marsh demonstrates the beneficial reuse of hydraulically placed dredge sediments to create high marsh habitat areas and increased shoreline flood protection in an existing marsh with listed species while emulating natural wetland structure and processes. this project also demonstrates methods to beneficially reuse dredged sediments to raise essential high marsh-upland transition zone habitats above rising sea levels. 2000 ft n 4 2 5 3 few areas of sf bay have as many people and critical infrastructure in low-lying areas unprotected by levees as marin baylands. in the tam junction area of within richardson bay there is occasional high tide flooding of roadways causingtraffic lane closures even in dry weather conditions. sea level rise acceleration is expected to intensify tidal flooding frequency in tidal flood-prone bayland roadways and trails. therefore the marin baylands can serve as an ideal test location for proof of concept for these types of projects that can inform shoreline erosion designs all around san francisco bay. this project aims to build upon a successful project in eastern marin (the aramburu island beach restoration project in richardson bay that aims to demonstrate the ability of estuarine beach systems to inhibit wind-wave erosion and adapt shorelines to rising sea levels. the ability of a natural beach system to resist erosion depends on matching the proper slope and grain size with the dominant wind-wave energy. a fully developed constructed beach profile can also include a sandy foreshore that dissipates wave energy through friction as well as a gravel/cobble beach and storm berm that adjusts in slope and elevation in response to the local wave energy. an outcome from this project is to provide engineering design guidance to the more traditional engineering design community to design these types of systems. the specific goals of the project are as follows:  design and permit four projects and then construct at least one project of engineered shoreline improvement projects utilizing natural analogues of beach and estuarine marsh systems to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these systems to inhibit wind-wave erosion and provide flood protection under slr conditions  monitor and develop engineering design guidelines and proof of concept for the larger engineering design community to promote these types of engineered natural shoreline projects in areas where the proper design conditions (i.e. slopes and rock size match the dominant wind-wave energies).  protect eroding salt marsh areas that contain sensitive habitats and multiple special-status species using methods and materials compatible with their conservation (i.e. alternative to armoring with rock) particularly where those marsh habitats are threatened by erosion and currently provide some level of shoreline protection  demonstrate the beneficial reuse of dredge sediments (project 5 lower coyote creek/bothin marsh) to reconstruct and enhance high marsh to maintain sustainable high tide flood refuge habitat and shoreline resilience as sea level rises. an additional element of this project will be mapping of critical drinking water infrastructure along the richardson bay shoreline by the marin municipal water district (mmwd) and replacement of threatened infrastructure in critical locations threatened by sea level rise. this mapping task will delineate the location and elevation of critical drinking water pipes and allow the proposed shoreline protection alternatives to integrate with their infrastructure. ","few areas of sf bay have as many people and critical infrastructure (i.e. water and wastewater treatment access roads community facilities) in low lying areas unprotected by levees as eastern marin. in some locations within richardson bay there is roadway flooding and traffic lane closures even under current high tide conditions without any rain inputs. unless we demonstrate alternatives to rock rip-rap and sea walls to protect eroding and flooded shorelines the public is going to demand these hard engineering solutions that have aesthetic and habitat impacts as valuable marsh and estuarine beach habitat is lost to shoreline engineering. the aramburu beach restoration project in richardson bay constructed in 2011 has provided a successful demonstration of natural beach system to protect shorelines under relatively high wave energies as compared with many of the 4 demonstration projects proposed here. this project will extend these concepts into more visible urban areas to provide a higher visibility and demonstration value to the public as well as to the engineering design community as to the effectiveness of these systems. mmwd will be coordinating the mapping and replacement of critical drinking water infrastructure in conjunction with the shoreline adaptation work under this grant application. mmwd provides drinking water to the residents of marin county and some of their facilities are directly threatened by sea level rise and coastal erosion. ","there are large residential areas and associated infrastructure that will become more and more inundated as sea levels rise. there will be greater community demand for hardened engineering structures such as rock rip-rap and seawalls to protect the shoreline and community from flooding. there will be greater demand to armor the shoreline and the existing marsh habitat will be drowned out with an associated loss of habitat. water supply will be compromised without planning for erosion and salt-water intrusion. water quality and public safety could be compromised without planning.

","the primary task associated with establishment of a subsidence monitoring network within the sebp groundwater basin involves conducting an extensive field survey. that effort will also include the construction of survey monuments throughout the basin. details of this work effort follow. a basin-wide gps land survey will be conducted to establish reference datum for subsidence monitoring. the survey will cover the area from bay farm island in alameda to the city of hayward. such a survey will allow entities within the sebp basin to tie their individual groundwater monitoring wells together from an elevation perspective (and hence assure for consistency regarding water level readings subsidence monitoring etc.). those wells which are already in place will be coupled with the construction of new survey monuments (permanent monuments) to measure land subsidence. ebmud has an in-house surveying group that will be called upon to conduct this work. key tasks of this project include: gps field surveys monument construction office processing and production of a technical memorandum documenting well elevation data. the work assumes a 3 man crew in the field and a party chief / survey supervisor in the office processing the data and preparing a technical memorandum that will serve as a work-product \"document\" for this project. the reference datum will be used to establish a base line condition for tracking land surface changes from seismic movement as well as from the impacts (if any) of groundwater pumping on surface elevation and water levels. having a single recent survey will assure that survey data collected by various entities (cities counties agencies etc.) is of great accuracy / quality. the stakeholder group formed for the ongoing sebp basin gmp effort will be informed of the plans for the survey. data derived will be used to update documentation and models prepared as part of the south east bay plain basin groundwater management plan (currently in development) and hence will be of use / of benefit to all stakeholder agencies (city of hayward city of oakland city of alameda the port of oakland etc.). ","land subsidence is of critical concern to agencies (such as the city of alameda) that have land surfaces very close to the existing elevation of the san francisco bay. even small changes in elevation can create added flood risk to residents. in the future it is expected that the south east bay plain groundwater basin will serve as an increasely used feature. ebmud plans to utilize it to address water supply needs during times of drought. likewise the city of hayward envisions continued use of the basin. other entites such as the port of oakland and various golf courses with the region may rely more and more on water from said basin to address non-potable water supply needs. in order to prevent land subsidence from taking place within the basin due to mismanagement it is important to have a detailed baseline survey with set benchmarks that various users can refer to as a reference. this project effort allows for a detailed baseline to be established.

","restoration of the tidal marsh ecosystem in san francisco bay is a regional priority for natural resources managers. the bay goals (2000) and usfws tidal marsh ecosystem recovery plan both call for the protection and restoration of upland transitional (aka ecotone) habitats and the recovery plan in particular places a high priority on allowing for landward migration of marsh habitats onto bordering plains as sea level rises (i.e. climate change adaptation). however these documents do not fully describe transitional habitats quantify the amount needed to aid species of special concern while allowing for slr nor prioritize specific sites for protection and restoration. without an understanding of these habitats water resources projects also cannot adequately consider them during planning. we will provide the information needed to help planners consider both current and predicted needs of the tidal marsh ecosystem in designing their water resources projects. we will develop a gis decision support tool and utilize it to identify and prioritize marsh-upland transitional habitats (aka ecotone) in order to assist land managers in protecting and restoring san francisco bays tidal marsh ecosystem. we propose to take a strategic approach towards decision support accounting for the landward migration of the ecosystem in response to predicted sea level rise (slr). the first phase will describe and characterize transitional habitats with an advisory committee of regional specialists. utilizing the definition developed in the first phase the second phase will inventory and map the current (and potential historic) extent of these transitional habitats within the san francisco bay estuary. then utilizing the characterization developed in phase one the third phase will identify criteria to rank and prioritize sites for land managers based on both ecological needs and management goals. ","land managers currently lack a comprehensive understanding of the distribution extent and ecological integrity of important habitats (e.g. for species of special concern) contained within the open space they manage. this is due in part to missing data but can also be attributed to poor data access (i.e. unknown sources) or organization. we propose to fill these needs for the entire estuary by developing a decision support toolkit for tidal marsh-upland transitional habitats. we will utilize it to inventory characterize and prioritize these habitats to assist land managers restoring and protecting san francisco bay. we will help managers allocate limited resources on prioritization alternative/scenario evaluation and adaptive management which will include considerations for the influence of future climate change and land-use scenarios. this project will aid management decisions by utilizing slr predictions to strategically prioritize conservation. it will address uncertainties by identifying and prioritizing transitional habitat locations that specifically allow habitats to adapt to predicted change. it is timely due to a current regional focus on the tidal marsh ecosystem including transitions. this project will help inform management at regional scales and provide a framework that could be utilized for the conservation and management of other habitats. ","(1) obligate fauna utilize transition zones as high tide refugia and there is a current lack of information about the distribution of these habitats and their adequacy to meet this need. without adequate information water resources planners and managers will be unable to fully account for these needs in their projects. (2) in the face of potential slr without proactively identifying and managing transition zones the impact of slr and storm water events might not be mitigated as effectively as possible by water resources planners and managers. the usfws ecosystem recovery plan refers to this as \"strategic habitat conservation\" and promotes it vigorously. (3) and there are dozens of rare threatened endangered extirpated and extinct plants (i.e. species of special concern) that once thrived in the transition zones that cannot be addressed without these habitats receiving adequate attention. without the methods and materials required to actively manage these habitats they will remain impaired by weeds and not provide the functions and values needed by native transitional habitat plants or obligate tidal marsh fauna. ","tidal marshes are known to provide water quality benefits so their conservation creation restoration and enhancement should provide some measure of this. our projects primary nexus with water resources is floodwater management which often includes creating flood protection levees where sea level rise threatens infrastructure. we anticipate being able to provide enough information to help planners locate flood protection infrastructure in such a way as to avoid or at least minimize impacts to the tidal marsh ecosystem help them design levees that actually provide habitat value and climate change adaptation to the tidal marsh ecosystem and then provide them with detailed methods and materials for restoring appropriate plant communities on newly created upland transitional areas. the landscape wide mapping of existing and potential sites along the tidal marsh / upland interface will also assist in prioritizing sites that might also help mitigate the impacts of slr. the development of a decision support system (dss) for the tidal marsh / upland transitional zones as well as our affiliated projects that fill data gaps and support habitat restoration implementation are to better inform resource stewardship of the tidal marsh ecosystem enhance habitat protection and restoration and mitigate the impacts of sea level rise (slr) on coastal communities. by providing decision support to managers making choices that may impact the tidal marsh ecosystem we will better enable them to consider these natural resources and make more informed decisions about their management. our findings will be organized at the parcel level to allow for easier application to planning work and provide managers with a list of parcels that are a priority for tidal marsh ecosystem recovery. better resource stewardship is possible when data is not only available but also provided in a manner that makes it easy for managers to interpret and utilize. the dss will assist better decision making by synthesizing available (and newly collected) data and our knowledge into a set of easy to use tools. primary among these will be a prioritized list of sites for protection and restoration. in addition we will provide more detailed maps of existing tidal marshes throughout the estuarine system. the biotic abiotic (incuding projected slr) and socioeconomic datasets will be integrated into a set of maps to characterize (and then prioritize) tidal marshes in order to assess the relative quality of their upland transitional habitats. other important characteristics include the topography adjacent to a tidal marsh what quantity of open space is available and the plant community currently occupying it as well as adjacent land uses to assess their impacts and sea level rise models to prepare for their predictions. our partners will collect needed data on the use of upland transitions by species of special concern to better characterize their structure and function. these data will be compiled into gis and used to assess upland transitional parcels through a parcel based model weighting the different habitat characteristics and potential threats (land use slr etc). the model includes habitat metrics based on important habitat characteristics weve identified through our work with many regional specialists. the metrics will be assigned importance values relative to one another such that once combined into an index score will allow for parcel rankings to be produced. managers referring to our parcel rankings will be able to access the justification for the scoring through the gis. land managers will be able to assess the overall value of protection or restoration of given sites within the larger landscape wide prioritization assisting in identifying the most cost effectiverestoration sites.

methodical process that will deliver quality watershed improvements through a facilitated planning process which has been modeled after past programs in the district. the successes of past projects have shown to be beneficial to the residential and agricultural community as well as the wildlife communities that rely heavily on the resources within the watersheds. the cow project and collaborating partners are dedicated to our goals of constructing management practices providing long term benefits to ranchers residents tourists and recreational users of nearby beaches bays and estuaries. the tomales bay watershed in particular is an important coastal resource of statewide significance harboring a rich variety of endemic plant and animal species including federally listed

biological significance and 3) includes three critical coastal areas (lagunitas creek walker creek tomales bay). tomales bay is used by boaters kayakers fisherman and enjoyed by beach lovers. the cow project will assist ranchers by implementing ranch water quality plans that specifically outline construction priorities and schedules by completing 20-30 management measures. projects will focus on reducing sediment and associated nutrients and microbial contamination implementing efficient water conservation use promoting the removal of invasive and non-native species and enhancing riparian corridors. projects will include but are not limited to streambank protection projects that stabilize eroding banks gully repairs that halt downcutting and advancement of upstream erosion and vegetative filter strip installation that filters runoff and traps sediment and other pollutants and installation of sheet flow ponds. progress will be monitored to calculate estimates of the level of pollutant retention achieved at sites to indicate individual management measure and overall project effectiveness. we will also rely on other watershed monitoring efforts currently being conducted by partner agencies and organizations such as the tomales bay watershed council and rwqcb to guide our efforts. random sites will be selected and intensively monitored to quantify management practice effectiveness in detail according to the marin rcd riparian zone monitoring plan. management practices are predicted to result in a 60-90% reduction in pathogen loading 50-75% reduction in fine sediment delivery from riparian fencing and revegetation projects and 75-95% reduction from headcuts gullies and streambank repairs. the resulting quantity of sediment nutrients and microbial pollution that the management measures and program reduce or retain will be dependent upon the total number of management measures implemented and the conditions of each site at the measures are implemented. additionally it is expected ranchers will individually pursue implementation and monitoring of practices outside the program to meet ranch planning requirements and report annual progress to the rwqcb. precautions will be taken to limit temporary negative impacts to stream channels where construction of biotechnical streambank stream channel stabilization and fisheries enhancement practices will occur. in stream projects may have a temporary risk to water quality however all projects will comply with ceqa and permit requirements which will minimize risks. for example qualified biologists will be on hand to supervise contractors and any necessary dewatering of sensitive stream areas. each practice identified in the marin coastal permit coordination program ceqa document contains a set of conditions which have been reviewed by local environmental groups and public permitting agencies. the conditions are written into permit documents and are provided to contractors to ensure compliance during the construction period. the project also offers additional benefits in the area of cutting edge carbon sequestration research. the marin rcd in collaboration with the marin agricultural land trust university of ca cooperative extension service marin organic usda natural resources conservation service and uc berkeley are currently conducting carbon sequestration research associated with the implementation of agricultural management and restoration practices at 36 rangeland sites across marin. the projects funded by cow ii will further extend monitoring research into

","marin ","38.03278 | -122.79037 "," "," ","gravel creek at vedanta society retreat center olema ca "," ","the nonprofit vedanta society of san francisco (vssf) has maintained an exisiting instream sedimentation pond on an unanmed tributary of olema creek referred to as gravel creek since taking ownership of their vedanta retreat property in olema in the late 1960's. implementation of periodic dredgings of the pond was contingent on the issuance of permits regulating such activity from the county of marin department of public works (dpw) the san francisco bay regional water quality control board (rwqcb) and the california department of fish and game (cdfg). preparation of a sediment management plan was mandated by the county of marin as a condition of the permit issued by the county for the on-site pond dredging conducted in november 2008. the permitting agencies had made clear their desire to end the practice of dredging the existing instream pond on the on-site tributary to olema creek due to the resulting environmental and biotic impacts. clearwater hydrology completed the \"draft sediment management plan for the gravel creek watershed vedanta retreat olema ca\" (smp) in february 2011. the smp for gravel creek was developed with the aim of providing for the low-cost geomorphically compatible removal of the existing on-stream sediment retention basin. as conceived the smp will comply with the directive issued by marin county to retire the existing sediment pond while providing for a reconnection of upper gravel creek with its approximate historical (pre-1968) alignment and its former floodplain. the smp will also both minimize the extent and severity of construction disturbance to wetland habitat and enhance the potential for eventual anadromous fish access to gravel creek. finally it will maintain or reduce the present flood risk to the vedanta dwellings and outbuildings. ","significant water quality concerns for olema creek stem from its designation as habitat for the federally listed species including coho salmon steelhead trout california freshwater shrimp and the california red-legged frog. due to its support of viable populations of the coho salmon and steelhead water quality objectives for olema creek and its tributaries are the referenced cold water criteria as defined by the rwqcb. the 303 (d) list of impaired waters maintained by the rwqcb lists lagunitas creek (including olema creek) as impaired by nutrients fecal coliform and sediment. ","while the existing sediment pond traps the majority of gravels finer material stays in suspension and is carried with the floodwater into the diversion ditch where it continues downstream along with decaying organic matter and fine sediment eroded from the banks of the ditch. lower gravel creek has been subjected to heightened bed and bank scour due to the mining of gravel from the system via the sediment pond. since a stream has a certain capacity to transport sediment at a particular discharge the lack of sediment supplied to the reach during the diversion period resulted in an increased tendency toward scour within the reach. the existing sediment pond and associated channel instability in lower gravel creek results in increased fine sediment loading to the creek along this lower reach and increased quantities of fines delivered to olema creek. ","returning the mainstem gravel creek channel to its pre-1968 alignment will eliminate the short circuiting discharge of floodwater through the sediment pond. while the pond traps the majority of gravels finer material stays in suspension and is carried with the floodwater into the diversion ditch where it continues downstream along with decaying organic matter and fine sediment eroded from the banks of the ditch. lower concentrations of fine suspended material in gravel creek flow will decrease turbidity and coliform bacteria (vegetation derived) and increase dissolved oxygen content (do).rerouted channel flows will in the short- to mid-term incur significant new sedimentation in the current wetlands burying much of the fine decaying plant matter. after sedimentation has progressed mildly sloping floodplains will form that provide positive drainage and reduce the extent of backwater ponding. these floodplains will likely support a mix of wetland and other riparian plants (e.g. willows alder) that will reduce the area under a perennially saturated condition decreasing anerobic decay and its resulting odors.rerouted channel flows will progressively form a stable channel through the lowlands. the re-formed channel will develop through the wetland and its gravel bed will reduce the frequency of contact of in-channel flow with any overbank wetlands especially once the sedimentation process begins to rebuild and reclaim its alluvial floodplain. maintenance of an alluvial bankfull channel free of decaying wetland vegetation will reduce the suspended solid load and turbidity of the channel flows as well as dilute any coliform concentrations therein.the retirement of the sediment pond and the near elimination in flows conveyed in the diversion ditch will restore a balance to the sediment storage and management functions of the gravel creek channel and its floodplains. in addition this balance will affect the scouring capability of floodflows along lower gravel creek. this portion of gravel creek has been subjected to heightened bed and bank scour due to the mining of gravel from the system via the sediment pond. since a stream has a certain capacity to transport sediment at a particular discharge the lack of sediment supplied to the reach during the diversion period resulted in an increased tendency toward scour within the reach. this tendency is most obvious in channel reaches downstream of large reservoirs where severe channel incision bank erosion and other bed instabilities can extend a more or downstream from the reservoir outlet. less on-site channel instability will result in reduced fine sediment loading to the creek along this lower reach and reduce the quantities of fines delivered to olema creek. passive retirement of the existing sediment pond will eliminate future maintenance dredging on gravel creek. past dredging activity while mitigated to the extent possible likely resulted in increased short-term delivery of fine sediments to the diversion ditch for later transport downstream to olema creek. gravel creek is one of the tributaries draining inverness ridge that supply critical summer base flow to olema creek. with adequate access the riffle-dominated reaches of gravel creek harbor potential rearing habitat for steelhead trout. thus the retirement of both the instream sediment pond and the (further) upstream culvert crossing as well as the relocation of the cross-valley channel crossing and the installation of a more fish-friendly arch culvert would eliminate two significant barriers to steelhead. other barriers may remain within the vedanta lands however incremental progress toward the goal of enhancing habitat for this threatened species would be a significant benefit of the smp.

"implementation of the napa river watershed assessment framework ","the community is coming together to begin implementing or proposing new remediation projects to improve the napa river watershed. but how do they know whether these programs are working? if they are not effective and even if they are how can watershed managers make them better? and finally how can leaders make intelligent choices about which promising programs are working best in the watershed over the long-term? a set of indicators for the watershed is required that links the structural and functional units of the system together and informs managers regarding applied remediation outcomes. this project will implement the results of the department of water resources and bay delta program - supported 2010 napa river watershed assessment framework (waf) pilot study that was guided by multiple watershed goals integrated resource management strategies and involved the input and guidance from a number of local and regional agencies and community groups. implementing recommendations set forth in the 2010 waf pilot study includes peer review and additional stakeholder input on indicators of watershed health development of a watershed monitoring strategy/program for obtaining indicator metrics establishment of a central database and trend projections protocol and dissemination of a watershed annual report card. the report card allows watershed residents and managers to readily assess the condition of the watershed see trends or changes in those conditions over time and take action to achieve desired improvements (i.e. watershed goals) through adaptive management. in addition to implanting the waf in the napa river watershed this project will develop a watershed sustainability index (wsi) that will be integrated with the waf to provide watershed stewards a dynamic science-based measure of information on the status and trends of a watersheds ecological social and economic features as well as system changes from existing pressures and policy responses. the project is a public and private venture that will rely on strategic partnerships and multiple agency coordination to leverage all available resources and best available science with a mutual goal of establishing an efficient and effective monitoring program and database that provide for meaningful indicators of watershed health for the napa river watershed based on stakeholder input and critical peer review. ","napa; solano ","38.082402 | - 122.232477 ","january 1 2013 ","december 31 2014 ","the napa river watershed is the largest watershed in the north san francisco bay area (418 square miles) draining napa valley southward to san pablo bay. the napa river acts as a central trunk stream collecting tributaries from the hills and canyons to the west and east that descend to the napa valley floor. highest point in the watershed is found at the northern watershed boundary of mount st. helena (4344 feet elevation) which is also the highest peak in the bay area. the river supports the highest diversity and abundance of native fish populations and is regarded as a key watershed in the san francisco bay system. ","water quality: the project provides for expanded monitoring and the collection of data that informs the water quality of the napa river watershed. monitoring activities will provide information on changes to water quality overtime and location for the napa river (and select tributaries) which will illustrate special and seasonal trends in water quality in order to guide further management actions. groundwater benefits: the project will expand the state of knowledge of the main napa valley miliken-sarco-tulucay jameson/american canyon and carneros groundwater basins through increased monitoring of indicators. groundwater is a major component of the water supply for users within the napa river watershed including agriculture and rural residents. it is important that local decision-makers and community members have knowledge of the status of groundwater level trends within the watershed as measured by select indicators in order to know when withdrawal is exceeding recharge rate and capacity. habitat protection & restoration: the project will provide metrics such as riparian vegetation cover and other such indicators that quantify the various habitats of the napa river watershed. indicators related to habitat can inform managers of needed actions when the trends in indicators point to problems with habitat health. indicators also provide valuable information on the success of restoration efforts by quantifying beneficial effects. flood protection: the napa river watershed has long experienced problems with flooding. potential data collection and related indicators could prove valuable to land managers in the watershed as considerations are made regarding alternatives to manage flood waters and minimize flood damage. related to disadvantaged community: a significant number of people fish in the napa river. many are from low-income hispanic populations in the watershed and the fish might provide their only family meal. data collection and indicators will inform watershed managers regarding potential human health risks of eating fish from the river and the health of those fish populations related to fishing pressure they experience from humans. the project will assure that all sectors of the community are included in determining goals of the watershed. this will provide disadvantaged persons the opportunity to have their voices heard and their ideals for watershed stewardship incorporated into the assessment. ","the community is coming together to begin implementing or proposing new remediation projects to improve the napa river watershed. but how do they know whether these programs are working? if they are not effective and even if they are how can watershed managers make them better? and finally how can leaders make intelligent choices about which promising programs are working best in the watershed over the long-term? a set of indicators for the watershed is required that links the structural and functional units of the system together and informs managers regarding applied remediation outcomes. the 2010 napa river waf and the implementation of its recommendations through this project recognize that the community needs more and better data and deeper analysis to understand the health of its watershed relative to established goals. to more accurately predict changes and take proactive adaptive management steps it is essential to regularly monitor indicators that reflect water quantity and quality directly and indirectly. many basic conditionssuch as the state of the streams during the driest time of year the water use efficiency of residents and businesses the state of the local fisheries  cannot be tracked clearly (i.e. with great confidence) until watershed indicator monitoring efforts are increased and improved. this project consists of conducting peer review of the indicator report from the 2010 waf and securing concurrence on interpretation and recommendations; sharing the results from the project with public stakeholder groups to obtain feedback on the appropriateness of the indicators and targets selected; reviewing all targets and scoring to verify that they mean the same level of watershed health across all indicators; designing/implementing a monitoring strategy for data collection on key indicators; and establishing a centralized database to track indicators conduct analysis and develop/publish a watershed report card over the long-term. peer review and stakeholder input on indicators consistent with waf recommendations this project will assure that the results of the 2010 pilot study are further reviewed by a technical review committee and watershed stakeholders to refine the approach and ensure the communitys goals are accurately represented and tracked. at the start of the project a number of diverse experts will be asked to serve on a technical review committee that will oversee the development of the monitoring and indicator program. public engagement workshops and presentations will be designed and facilitated for interested citizens stakeholders in the napa river watershed can review the waf process and report card information from 2010 verify the appropriateness of goals objectives criteria and indicators selected and identify gaps that need to be fulfilled. widely accepted group dynamic facilitator techniques (e.g. technology of participation pattern mapping open space technology world caf etc.) will be employed for these steps. design/implement monitoring program data are already being collected on various indicators in the watershed such as impervious surface amounts migrating fish populations access to public open space habitat fragmentation and connectivity aquatic biota groundwater stream temperature carbon storage and net primary productivity. engagement with state and local agencies special districts will be done to integrate and coordinate the sources for different monitoring data of the napa river watershed that have been identified as indicators of watershed health (such as the ca dwr cdfg napa county department of planning building and environmental services napa county public works the napa county health department etc.). consultation with these agencies and other responsible entities will allow for the development of an effective and efficient monitoring program to support the report card work. project implementation will rely upon establishing expanded organizational involvement to further refine current and future metrics and monitoring to inform additional indicators identified through the public engagement process. the projects monitoring program will build upon existing data latest available technology and best available science to achieve a robust range of relevant metrics. database/analysis there are a number of entities that collect data and report on various conditions of the napa river watershed. the project will establish protocol and reporting specification to collectively assemble all available data being monitored that informs the health of the watershed. data metrics and indicator measures will be compiled in a centralized database. the database will ease analysis and trend reporting by creating a centralized platform for all collected data. report card/wsi/trend analysis an annual report card will be produced that relates the status of the napa river watershed relative to established goals and the previous cycle reporting condition. data metrics and indicator measures will be compiled in a centralized database that leverages a number of already existing data compilations on the watershed as well as those planned to be implemented soon. standard statistical analyses will be used to search for data patterns. the technical committee will be convened to review the monitoring program design and indicator dissemination through the report card. the report card will be printed annually in local and regional newspapers published on the web and disseminated through a county of napa mailing list. in implementing the waf through the public verification process and conducting a monitoring program to support report card dissemination the project scope will also have collected sufficient data in order to develop a watershed sustainability index (wsi) that presents a simple and timely picture of watershed sustainability. an index is an aggregate of indicators (or proxy) where the index illustrates in one measure the status of combined metrics that measure ecological social and economic data independently. a wsi can provide a much needed measure for organizations to assess the sustainability of the watershed not only creating a temporal and/or spatial comparison framework but also a means of identifying bottlenecks to achieving overall basin health. the project will develop an integrated dynamic science-based index that identifies the status and trends of the napa river watersheds hydrologic environmental economic social and cultural features as well as changes from existing pressures and policy responses. ","the overall need of the project is to engage the community to proactively monitor and assess the health of the napa river watershed in order to identify performance relative to community goals and management actions. the 2010 napa river waf pilot study identified the pressing need to broaden the level of understanding on the health and function of the napa river watershed. the 2010 waf initiated an effort to identify the goals of the community select key indicators and develop a report card that scored the health of the napa river watershed. there is a need for this project to pick up where the 2010 napa river waf left off by conducting peer review of the waf process and approach validating assumptions identifying and expanding monitoring reviewing and securing concurrence on indicator reliability and establishing a routine reporting of watershed health. the multiple stakeholders within the watershed represent a wide range of preferences and ideals for the use and function of the napa river. integrating stakeholder objectives into common goals for the watershed is a pressing need. this will allow the community to jointly identify and prioritize the goals of the watershed and begin to work towards realizing their objectives. it will also empower citizens of the watershed to seek more secure funding that supports continued improvement and protection efforts of the watershed. the scientific data available through monitoring and other metrics that inform managers regarding the health of the napa river watershed is insufficient to provide a meaningful assessment of the various indicators of health. identifying the most effective and informative metric/indicators and collecting these metrics through routine monitoring within the napa river watershed is another need and will provide the scientific basis for which meaningful assessments of napa river watershed health can be made. these indicators might include: water quality issues such as nutrient sediment erosion toxins and biological oxygen demand (bod); water supply issues such as municipal demands and supply sources agricultural irrigation needs and navigation; water resource stewardship issues such as habitat restoration fish migration and flood mitigation; and socio-economic issues such as disadvantage community nutrition recreation and property values. there is no single agency that is responsible for monitoring and reporting on the overall health of the napa river and its watershed. various data sources are collected by a number of different agencies and entities. there is a need to establish a centralized database to store collect and query scientific data related to the health of the napa river watershed. such a database would provide a reliable and accessible record of watershed conditions and identify trends in watershed health that would be described by the proposed basin-wide report card. some of the types of critical questions that can be answered by the integrated assessment process that creates the report card could include the following. the watershed is listed as impaired under section 303(d) of the clean water act for nutrients pathogens and sediment. sediment impairment impacts river gravels and degrades salmonid habitat. some of the sources of pollutants identified by the san francisco bay regional water quality control board include non-point source pollution from municipal storm water agriculture (including grazing and vineyard operations) rural roads and open spaces and incision of the main stem of the napa river. point sources of poor water quality in the watershed include industrial plants wastewater facilities and landfills. a most important question to be addressed by the report card will be changes in patterns of pollutants in the watershed over time and whether landshed remediation including adoption of best management practices is making a difference in water quality. the napa river watershed has long faced problems from flooding due to its many tributaries draining steep side valley canyons. agricultural developments and other land conversions in the floodplain including draining and diking of the valley floor further reduces flood management capacity as well as affecting biological diversity and backwater and slough habitats. report card indicators that address measures of and changes in flood control capacity in the basin will be extremely important to managers in guiding their moving forward with planning further expensive remediation to prevent severe flooding. present efforts by several napa river watershed responsible agencies are focused on measuring the population dynamics of anadromous fish such as salmon using the napa river for spawning. not only will any report card indicators asking questions specifically about fish migration rates be important to these efforts but indicators for suspended sediments stream water temperatures and gravel permeability which are limiting factors for salmonid populations will further the understanding of providing improved habitat for salmonid spawning in the river. indicators that provide metrics on fish migration patterns will help to identify area of concern. fish passage barriers limit migration of anadromous fish but the project will help to discern the most effective location to mitigate through fish ladder or barrier removal projects. human development within the watershed and groundwater extraction has resulted in hydro-modification and a lowering of the groundwater level. this coupled with stream flow diversion has affected aquatic and riparian habitats that are dependent on groundwater sources. the importance of a report card indicator questioning groundwater issues becomes paramount when so much of the agriculture in the napa river watershed as well as domestic supplies relies upon groundwater pumping. ","lack of community involvement in identifying the goals of the napa river watershed would result in apathy towards the health of the system. a critical mass of public engagement is essential in assuring that the diverse interests of stakeholders are identified considered and incorporated into the overall approach. the napa river watershed community must be responsible for selecting the goals of the watershed. a participatory holistic and inclusive planning process that leads to positive concrete changes in communities lends credibility to a project initiative helps to gain further support and funding provides strength for action or political pressure blocks passive sabotage and creates community ownership of and responsibility for dealing with the issues of concern. inhibit or restrict managers/agencies from making informed policy decisions about watershed programs. there is not at present an easily understood and accepted process that can be used to track the effectiveness of watershed improvement activities in an integrated fashion. there are a diverse array of agencies/stakeholders pursuing multiple objectives in the napa river watershed through modifications to water supply infrastructure and operations reduction of nonpoint pollution restoration of stream geomorphology and biological productivity control of erosion and climate change management. this project would develop a community/stakeholder vetted approach for tracking indicators and reporting on their status relative to agreed upon goals. when monitoring and data collection allows for a consistent measurement at regular intervals programs become traceable and provide information as to whether or not actions/policies are effective in implementing goals. the assessment process seeks to find out if goals are on target to being realized and to identify where more effort is needed. a well-conceived indicator provides a baseline and a target which allows the implementer to understand the indicator trend. a good indicator will identify trends whether positive or negative and will identify a potential problem while corrective actions can still be implemented. decision-making and policy formulation within the napa river watershed would continue to be business as usual. without leadership from this project reporting of indicators will continue to be implemented in an ad hoc manner with no integrated measure of the watershed health. the napa river waf approach is built on metrics and indicators that are organized into a hierarchical structure corresponding to aspects of ecological economic and social conditions based on community derived goals for the napa river watershed. central to the waf is the description of goals for the watershed or sub-region being evaluated. from these goals measurable objectives are crafted and indicators selected to assess the condition relative to the established goal. a trend analysis based on watershed indicator measurements is critical for establishing the data and information on which to base policy decisions develop programs and assess their effectiveness in improving the health and function of the napa river watershed and its receiving bodies throughout the san francisco bay ecosystem. ","the project's immediate benefits are most directly related to resource stewardship as described below. however it is important to note that the project is critical in realizing overall health benefits to the entire napa river watershed by establishing community goals collecting system wide data and indicators and assessing the watershed status relative to goals. from this important foundation subsequent programs can be implemented and their effectiveness measured. implementation of the project will allow the community to make informed policy decisions and implement programs to achieve desired level of health and function of the napa river watershed. these direct and indirect benefits are briefly described below. water supply: (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) the project will provide data and information on the quantity of water supplies that are available to the watershed. detailed information can be used to inform policy decisions regarding the water availability and to develop programs to ensure continuous and reliable water supplies are available to all users. water quality: the project will provide data and information on the quality of surface and groundwater supplies within the watershed. this information will provide the community with a reliable and accurate representation of the status and trend of water quality for all water resources within the watershed. the baseline data and metrics on water quality parameters can be used to inform decisions on managing water resources to preserve and enhance the quality of water supplies. flood control and stormwater management: the project will provide important metrics and collect data on indictors related to flood management and control via the amount of non-developed flood plain within the watershed. this information can be utilized to adaptively manage for flooding and stormwater in a manner that provides benefits to the overall watershed. resource stewardship: (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) project implementation provides for the selection of indicators analyses and report generation in an open and transparent manner thereby creating an educational (and networking) opportunity for all involved and linking structural and functional measures of the watershed. implementation of the waf will assist in restoring value and function of the watershed to meet community goals. presently the napa river watershed has no integrated way of documenting the changing dynamics of the system. the project will develop methodology to measure trends in system functioning for a number of important indicators including biological hydrological land use and economic. by identifying those sectors that are falling short of established goals the community can emphasis efforts and allocate resource in a targeted way on improving these trends through focused programs and strategies. the project identifies metrics and indicators that will provide a meaningful measure relating the health and trend of the napa river watershed relative to community goals. currently data are generally insufficient or desperate to identify which metrics will best reflect whether an ecosystem is on a clear trajectory toward improvement because of the paucity of studies that couple functional measures with routine quantification of ecosystem structure. choosing indicators that reflect existing conditions facilitates a better understanding of how actions in a specific region can affect watershed function and structure overall. for example downstream conditions are important to consider since tidal influence results in reverse flows on a portion of the river. it is likely that health of napa river watershed (surface flows) is partially dependent on downstream conditions. by focusing upon a process that is community-driven for establishing an annual report card and watershed sustainability index for the napa river watershed this project will maximize public involvement as well as build local and regional partnerships. application of the waf in the napa river watershed is one means by which to track a limited number of informative indicators allowing watershed residents businesses visitors and managers to easily assess the state of the watershed to see trends or changes in conditions over time and to adapt their actions to achieve desired conditions (i.e. watershed goals). this project will result in an assessment framework that decision-makers and community members can use to guide development of indicators that address real on-the-ground issues related to environmental social and economic health of the watershed (or any other ecosystem) stated as a report card.

","project involves consideration of several control methods to reduce methyl mercury production including the installation of a hypolimnetic oxygenator which will supply oxygen to the lower depths of the reservoir during periods of stratification (apr-nov). as the reservoir stratifies oxygen in the lower depths is depleted until there is no oxygen present. under these conditions mercury present in the sediment can be converted into methyl mercury which is soluble and enters the food chain. mercury consumed by aquatic species bio-accumulates. providing oxygen to the lower depths of the reservoir will prevent depletion of oxygen and eliminate the production of methyl mercury.in order to generate oxygen a pressure swing adsorption module would be engineered and constructed on site (or construction of a large refrigerated tank to store liquid oxygen) along with associated communications equipment to permit remote monitoring and control via scada. compressors would deliver the oxygen to the lower depths of the reservoir. a speece cone or other inverted cone typical of hypolimnetic aeration or oxygenation systems would be engineered and constructed to allow mixing of the oxygen with waters in the lower depth without mixing the lake. mixing of the lake is undesirable because this would result in warm water being released from the lake and this in turn is not suitable for the species of fish currently supported by the streams below the reservoir. disadvantaged community: this project does not provide benefits specifically for a dac; the project will benefit the region in general. scalability: the grant request amount is scalable.

","the bay area's largest water agencies are working together to connect their water systems to improve the ability to sustain adequate water supplies after catastrophic events and to convey water supplies to meet future demands; this project is one of the last remaining connections that will improve regional water supply reliability during droughts and emergencies. based on future water demand forecasts bay area water agencies predict potential future supply shortfalls particularly during extended droughts (e.g. three or more years). as a result agencies are seeking out alternative supplies through numerous alternatives including the freeport regional water project storing water in the los vaqueros reservoir and the bay area regional desalination project. supplies from all these potential existing and future sources would benefit from an expanded treated water connection between ebmud and ccwd. the following is an example of how these projects and the ebmud/ccwd intertie rely on each other and can work together to meet the future bay area water supply needs. ebmuds water supply master plan 2040 incorporated an analysis of how ebmuds participation in the los vaqueros expansion could provide ebmud with supplemental supplies. during wetter years ebmud would store water in the los vaqueros reservoir for use when needed in dry years. from los vaqueros reservoir ccwd can deliver the stored water back to ebmud through the existing untreated water intertie or through a treated water connection. due to delivery limitations on the untreated intertie an expanded treated water connection adds an alternative delivery route to maximize the total water deliveries. the bay area regional desalination project relies on a similar concept; during wet years excess production from the facility would be stored in los vaqueros reservoir and delivered in dry years when partner water demand increases. delivering water to ebmud through an expanded ebmud/ccwd intertie enables water deliveries to the other bay area partners (zone 7 scvwd and sfpuc). the treated water connection adds diversity and reliability to each of the bay area agencys water supply portfolio. ","an expanded ebmud/ccwd treated water intertie greatly improves bay area water agency's ability to support each other during emergencies and droughts. without it the ability for bay area agencies to efficiently manage supplies during shortages is hindered. for example without the expanded treated water intertie ccwd cannot supply water stored in los vaqueros to ebmud unless ebmud simultaneously is in a drought and taking water from freeport. getting water to ebmud outside of this limited operational windowin turn enables water deliveries to sfpuc and scvwd through existing interties and to zone 7 through a new intertie (see irwm project proposal). ","in dry years when customer demands are highest the intertie could supply 10-15 million gallons per day of treated water. once delivered from ccwd to ebmud the water could then be delivered to zone 7 through a new treated water intertie (see irwm project proposal) sfpuc through an existing ebmud/sfpuc intertie in hayward and then to scvwd through an existing intertie (or via shared customers) with sfpuc. improving the connectedness between bay area agencies opens internal channels of coordination and communication that enhance the regional stewardship of water supplies. with future uncertainties related to climate change and species decline the importance of this regional coordination and joint stewardship of water supplies cannot be underestimated as the magnitude of shared challenges increases.

","the dublin san ramon services district's (dsrsd) central dublin recycled water distribution and retrofit project (project) will expand dsrsd's existing recycled water distribution system to deliver up to 240 acre-feet per year (afy) of recycled water within its service area. this project entails constructing recycled water distribution pipelines to convey water for landscape irrigation to several sites which includes schools parks a multi-family residential complex and streetscapes and medians along the pipeline alignments. the project consists of approximately 4260 feet of 12-inch recycled water main 1760 feet of 6-inch recycled water main and 2250 feet of 4-inch recycled water main. the lines will be constructed from the 16-inch derwa main supply line located in the iron horse trail to the project customers. the project will also provide plumbing retrofits to connect existing irrigation systems at dublin schools and parks to the recycled water system. the project will be designed to have a maximum delivery capacity of 340 afy. this project will also enable the district to extend its recycled water distribution system further west into established areas of dublin to connect other users in the future to permanently reduce potable demand by an additional 100+ acre-feet per year. ","this project will ultimately reduce/postpone development of new or expanded water supplies and will replace potable water currently used for irrigation and construction. the recycled water supply would also offset the water supply provided by the zone 7 water agency (zone 7) from the state water project (swp) which would consequently reduce diversions reduce groundwater extraction and reduce energy use (by reduced pumping). the expanded use of recycled water would also reduce the burden on existing federal water supply facilities such as the central valley project (cvp). the swp and cvp water contract allocations are closely inter-connected and the supply of recycled water would reduce demand and utilization of those valuable drinking water resources. recycled water is a drought resistant supply available all year long and can be stored in existing facilities already built. ","without this project there will be additional demands on the potable supplies provided by the state water project and the regional ground water basin. thus dsrsd's water supply will be more reliant on the already stressed water resources. dsrsd's water supply will become less reliable in the future with less flexibility and less able to meet additional demands from continued development in our service area. economic development in our service area will be stunted by the lack of reliable water supply. dsrsd's customers and regional customers will face their water supplies being reduced; with their water bills increasing. in the event of a state-wide drought increased pressure will be placed on the regional water basin; with the potential of salt water encroachment on the basin now used for potable storage. ","this project will help make recycled water available to more customers for landscape irrigation project to replace potable water formerly used for irrigation in the central core of the city of dublin. this project will help extend a successful derwa joint venture (dsrsd and ebmud) bringing recycled water to new areas for additional conservation of our potable resources. the use of recycled water in central dublin will reduce irrigation with potable water by 347 af per year. this project stretches the potable water supply of the bay/delta region by replacing some of the the potable water from the state water project now used for irrigation with recycled water from dsrsd's wwtp. also drop for drop recycled water used for irrigation is that much less water that has to be pumped out to be disposed of in san francisco bay. so the project will result in 347 af per year less of wwtp effluent disposed of in the bay and the corresponding decrease in electrical energy consumption needed to pump those volumes from the tri-valley area to the bay. by reducing potable consumption this project will help dsrsd as a water retailer meet the 20% by 2020 potable water reduction requirements set by state law. it will also serve as a demonstration project for the beneficial uses of recycled water to area residents. with this successful project underway dsrsd and derwa will be able to bring additional recycled water projects to the tri-valley area for implementation.

","watershed coordinators are the glue that hold together integrated watershed management projects. their primary goal is to facilitate partnerships and engage communities in on-the-ground action to protect our precious streams and bays. these coordinators will galvanize the community around the priorities identified in the visioning and planning projects conducted over the past five years. at least three new sites have been planned in the san pablo creek watershed two sites have been prioritized in the wildcat watershed and one large restoration project has been planned for rheem creek watershed at breuner marsh. the successful implementation of these restoration projects depends on the coordination of multiple stakeholders and requires community involvement and stewardship. many of these projects will fall apart at the seams without a watershed coordinator. the watershed project has also been working very closely with municipalities in the implementation of their water quality goals and the coordinator plays a strong role in the outreach and education component necessary to eliminate non-point source pollutants from the san pablo bay watershed and in the monitoring and assessment of pollutants of concern. without the coordinator most of the sites will not be monitored by an impartial partner and short-term pollution removal projects will not develop into comprehensive management strategies that leverage support from the community. the coordinator will further develop partnerships with local youth groups schools and after-school programs to educate the community about pollution prevention and raise awareness about watershed issues. the coordinator will play an important role in creating stakeholder partnerships to further improve the watershed conditions and has the task of addressing issues that concern more than one municipality or local jurisdiction within all the watersheds of san pablo bay south. the san pablo bay watershed is part of the calfed solution area. it has been identified by noaa as a priority for shoreline conservation due to its invaluable sudtidal and marsh ecosystems and has been identified as a critical riparian corridor by the contra costa county flood control district. moreover municipalities have been working on multiple plans to address flooding issues and have identified the need for low impact development measures to reduce the risk of flooding in the lower watersheds. wildcat san pablo and garrity are plagued with trash and have been deemed trash hotspots by contra costa county. rheem creek has been identified as a priority for restoration of marsh ecosystems by east bay regional parks district. the coordinator will work on long term solutions to the issues troubling these watersheds by uniting the energy of government nonprofit and community organizations to protect and enhance this critical watershed. ","(a.) water supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.): the watershed awareness and action plan for the san pablo bay south watershed will increase groundwater recharge after each lid project has been implemented. also revegetation or creekside properties with native plants will help with water conservation and increase percolation. (b.) water quality: all projects implemented in the watershed will lead to a cleaner san pablo bay. school based programs will result in greater stormwater pollution prevention awareness. waste free events at schools and trash management education will results in lower levels of trash entering the bay. monitoring stations will ensure constant monitoring of basic water quality and pollutants of concern around the watersheds of the san pablo bay. cleanups and waste reduction programs will stop trash from entering local waterways. lid projects will not only serve as educational tools but will also reduce pollutant-filled storwater from entering the bay. (c.) flood and stormwater management: the implementation of community-based lid projects will result in reduced surface runoff in the region and will enhance infiltration. we expect to identify ten sites and to design and install three of those community-based lid projects by the end of the grant. (d.) resource stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.): native plants create the necessary habitat to increase bird and insect populations in the area. we will increase the diversity in the restoration sites by 50% and increase structure diversity by 50%. this will increase the overall resiliency of the ecosystem and enhance its ecosystem value.

","water quality improvement: 24 bay area locations are recognized by the u.s. environmental protection agency as impaired by trash. save the bay has listed 225 creeks and other sites where trash is a significant problem. trash contributes to water quality impairment and degrades aquatic and riparian habitat in numerous ways. stormwater improvement: storm drainage infrastructure is a major conveyance of trash from streets and developed areas to our creeks and the bay. trash capture devices installed in catch basins or storm lateral junctures as well as the portion of the project that will develop and test landscape-based trash removal strategies (lid) will dramatically improve stormwater quality. habitat protection and restoration: riparian areas and creek banks are collection points for trash as well as important habitat. this project will improve riparian habitat in many places. flood protection: when trash clogs a storm drain inlet during a rain event (as often happens) flooding results. removal of trash from inlets during regular maintenance will keep stormwater flowing through the system to its outfalls. studies show that disadvantaged urban areas are significant trash generation sites. at the same time municipalities with large disadvantaged populations often have only minimal budget if any to deal with the problem. this project will prioritize location and installation of trash capture devices in disadvantaged communities. ","antecedent projects: this project builds on the san francisco estuary partnership's bay area-wide trash capture demonstration project (demonstration project) which provides full trash capture devices to 65 municipalities in seven bay area counties. the demonstration project also built the bay area trash tracker (www.bayareatrashtracker.org; login trashtracker; password 6f5fe58) a gis-based system of tracking trash capture installation locations surrounding land use characteristics and maintenance data. in 2012 a prop 84 award to the bay area stormwater management agencies association (\"tracking california's trash\") is providing funds to add a trash hotspots layer to the tracker; add full capture devices/locations in the city of los angeles; and create a trash portal for the california water quality monitoring council. in addition the prop 84 project will develop a method for measuring and monitoring trash in receiving waters; and charting the effectiveness of trash reduction best management practices. results of these two elements of the project will also be posted on the trash tracker and the portal. irwmp project concept: we hope to use irwmp funds to provide additional full capture devices in locations and of types that will be most efficient and cost-effective based on data gathered in the demonstration project. in addition we will design and test lid-based trash reduction solutions and add a lid layer to the tracker. throughout we will take advantage of lessons learned in the demonstration project and depending on timing the prop 84 trash initiatives. how the project will function: sfep/abag staff will manage all elements of the project in close cooperation with countywide stormwater program and municipal staff. over the past three years we have developed excellent working relationships with bay area stormwater program staff at all levels. sfep/abag will put out an rfp for trash capture devices that meet the standards of the municipal regional stormwater npdes permit. abag will then contract with municipalities that will order oversee installation and accept ownership and maintenance responsibility for devices abag will purchase. in addition we will contract for development of lid-based approaches to trash reduction and install demonstration projects in cooperating cities. finally we will contract for addition of a lid layer to the tracker and work with cities and abag staff to enter useful information about lid projects into the map-based system. ","all bay area residents are aware that we have a significant trash problem. trash degrades water quality and aquatic and riparian habitat; contributes to the texas-size horrific pacific gyre or \"garbage patch\"; causes flooding when trash clogs storm drainage infrastructure during storm events; may present a human health hazard; and creates eyesores and nuisance. trash is ubiquitous but it tends to collect in commercial/industrial areas near schools and convenience stores along roadways and highways and in our region's most deprived residential areas. u.s. epa has conservatively identified 24 bay area sites as impaired by trash (listed on the 2010 clean water act section 303(d) list of impaired waters) while save the bay names 225 trash hotspots adjacent to bay area waters. trash is a wholly anthropogenic pollution problem. consequently the san francisco bay regional water quality control board adopted in 2009 a municipal regional stormwater npdes permit that requires our larger communities (\"phase i\" npdes communities) to reduce trash pollution to zero in phases by 2022. the state water resources control board is in the process of adopting a statewide permit for smaller communities (in the bay area in marin napa sonoma and solano counties) that will also require them to address trash. yet due to severe budget restraints and municipalities' challenges in attempting to levy fees for property-based services (prop 218) compliance with these permits and addressing trash is extremely difficult for our city and county governments. the san francisco estuary partnership applies for these funds at the behest of the countywide stormwater program managers and the bay area's municipalities. ","trash will continue to degrade water quality and riparian/aquatic habitat. flooding will occur in areas where trash clogs storm drainage infrastructure during storm events. lid-based strategies for reducing trash pollution will not be developed or implemented. municipal budgets will be further strained by the costs of meeting trash-related permit requirements and some city and county governments will be out of compliance. ",": the project will create significant water quality benefits as trash will be removed from the environment before it reaches creeks or the bay. : trash capture devices approved and supplied under this project will be designed specifically not to overflow during a storm event. removing trash captured by devices before a storm event will reduce flooding hazard. we expect devices provided by this program will be sited and managed for maximum watershed-based benefit in order to be maximally cost-effective.

(2) evaluation and application of these primary considerations to rank potential methods and locations within the sonoma valley (and santa rosa plain) for conducting groundwater banking programs; and (3) collection of surface water and groundwater samples and performance of geochemical modeling. for areas determined to be favorable for groundwater banking detailed work plans for implementing pilot-scale demonstration testing programs are under development. phase 2 the second phase of the proposed project consists of the performance of a pilot study for asr using existing municipal supply well(s) in sonoma valley california. the pilot study will collect data needed to further assess the feasibility of aquifer storage and recovery as a technique for improving groundwater management in the sonoma valley. two potential pilot study locations with existing municipal water supply wells have been identified as candidates for asr through the groundwater banking feasibility study. the wells are located within groundwater-level pumping depressions located in the el verano area (valley of the moon water district well no. 5) and southeast of the city of sonoma (city of sonoma well no. 7). the phase 2 pilot-scale demonstration testing program consists of three successively tiered tests. each step builds on the empirical demonstration of feasibility of the previous tests and incrementally verifies program feasibility while allowing program assessment and modification based on field data collected during each step. pilot test step recharge volume and storage period test duration test objectives tier 1 recharge feasibility test (maximum 4 asr cycles) less than 75 acre-feet 4 weeks maximum storage duration less than 6 months  evaluate ability to recharge target aquifer and verify geochemical compatibility of native and recharged waters with aquifer mineralogy.  assess basic aquifer recharge and hydraulic parameters (e.g. specific capacity).  assess well efficiency for asr operations. tier 2 practical size determination (maximum 3 asr cycles) less than 300 acre-feet 3 months maximum storage duration less than 1 year  determine site-specific aquifer parameters (e.g. transmissivity storativity dispersion).  demonstrate recharge of suitable quantities of water to assess practical size and parameters for full-scale system and tier 3 pilot test.  establish compatibility of native and recharged water over seasonal recharge/storage/recovery cycles. tier 3 full scale pilot test (maximum 3 asr cycles) less than 1200 acre-feet 1 year maximum storage duration less than 3 years  establish design and operating parameters for full-scale project implementation.  evaluate rate of movement and area of influence of recharged water via groundwater model.  verify parameters for sustained recharge of target aquifer (e.g. transmissivity storativity dispersion migration).  establish water quality stability over long storage cycles. the proposed project would include performing an asr pilot study on one or both of these wells which would initially involve the following tier 1 activities: (1) several cycles of recharging and recovering between 50 and 75 acre feet of drinking water (russian river water) into a deep confined aquifer through an existing municipal supply well; (2) extensive monitoring of water quality conditions groundwater-level responses and well efficiency throughout the pilot study; and (3) evaluation and geochemical modeling of the pilot test results. based on the results of the tier 1 asr pilot study successively tiered testing would be completed to develop information needed to establish the project for full-scale implementation. phase 3 the third phase of the proposed project consists of the development of full-scale asr system(s) in sonoma valley which would be designed based on the results of the phase 2 activities described above. based on initial evaluation of recharge potential in sonoma valley and the availability of surface water from the russian river system for recharge it is estimated that a full-scale groundwater banking program could provide between 300 and 1200 acre-feet per year depending upon the number of wells utilized for recharge. ","the sonoma valley groundwater basin located in sonoma county california has been experiencing increasing stresses on its groundwater resources in recent years due to population growth and land-use changes. the basins water demands are met by a combination of imported water and native groundwater supplemented in recent years by recycled water and expanding water conservation programs. groundwater meets more than half of the water demand in the sonoma valley with irrigation being the largest use drawing on an estimated more than 70 percent of the annual groundwater demand. the current understanding of the groundwater resources in the basin comes primarily from a study conducted by the united states geological survey (usgs) which was co-funded by the water agency to evaluate the ground water resources of the sonoma valley (usgs 2006) and subsequent studies and monitoring associated with implementing the gwmp. the usgs study identified two primary areas of declining groundwater levels in sonoma valley which are present in the el verano area and southeast of the city of sonoma. subsequent monitoring and studies performed during implementation of the gwmp has better defined these areas and indicate that the declining groundwater levels are primarily associated with deeper aquifer zones in these areas (i.e. greater than 200 feet below ground surface). the usgs study also found that electrical conductivity measurements from wells located in the southern portions of sonoma valley exhibited increases over time potentially due to saline water intrusion and/or upwelling of geothermal waters. groundwater levels in some these areas range up to 100 feet below sea level which can potentially cause additional saline water intrusion. the sonoma valley relies on groundwater and imported surface water to meet domestic agricultural and urban demands. based on the 2006 usgs study in the year 2000 more than half the water demand was met with groundwater (57 percent) followed by imported water (36 percent) with the remaining demand met from recycled water (7 percent) and local surface water not which was not quantified. groundwater is the primary source of supply for approximately 25 percent of the sonoma valley population and is the sole source of drinking water supply for rural domestic and other unincorporated areas not being served by urban suppliers. rural domestic demand is met by groundwater extracted from privately owned and operated wells. there are also mutual water companies in the sonoma valley that supply domestic water to multiple households mainly with groundwater although some companies also use imported water. agricultural water demands are largely met by sonoma valley groundwater supplies. ","if the proposal is not implemented information needed to properly scope and develop a groundwater banking program in sonoma valley will not be collected and the groundwater basin may be vulnerable to continued groundwater-level declines and saline intrusion.

","i. water supply need: the city currently relies primarily on imported water from sfpuc to meet demands. while the city receives adequate potable water supply on average availability of imported water from sfpuc could diminish over time because of droughts climate change effects or regulatory actions which could reduce the potable water supply for the city in the long term. the city can improve water supply reliability by taking steps locally to manage water demand by providing supplemental water sources such as the proposed recycled water project. the project will provide a dependable locally controlled non-potable water source that will be available even in droughts to serve irrigation and other non-potable uses. the primary need for extending recycled water pipelines into palo alto will be to allow the city to maximize recycled water as a supplemental water source and offset potable water for higher quality use. ii. ability to reduce water demand and/or water supply: the project will directly supply 900 afy of recycled water to meet outdoor irrigation needs and conserve an equivalent amount of potable water for higher quality uses (e.g. drinking water). thus the project will reduce water demand on high-quality potable water but at the same time provide a sustainable long-term supply for customers with outdoor landscapes. the risk of droughts now and in the future is high in california. because of this risk rationing and potentially outright limiting potable water for uses that do not require high quality drinking water such as landscape irrigation toilet flushing cooling towers and other uses for non-potable water could occur in the city. the provision of recycled water will sustain landscape value during droughts when potable water use is restricted because it will deliver a reliable recycled water source. in summary the project will also improve potable water supply reliability by conserving drinking water. iii. resource stewardship need: one of the objectives of the rwqcb water quality control plan for the san francisco basin is to protect san francisco bay from degradation. the proposed project will redirect treated effluent of the rwqcp from the san francisco bay to existing customers for landscape irrigation. thus the project will conserve the san francisco bay by reducing the wastewater constituent mass loadings to the bay and enhancing preservation of salt water marshland habitats. in addition by providing a sustainable alternative water supply to customers for their use in landscape irrigation the city is protecting and enhancing its urban forest particularly during periods of droughts when mandatory rationing will restrict outdoor water use. the urban forest is highly valued asset in the city. ","if the project is not implemented the city of palo alto will continue to import over 900 afy of hetch hetchy potable water supplies for irrigation purposes. although the hetch hetchy currently provides an adequate supply of potable water for both drinking water and irrigation purposes that supply could diminish over time because of droughts climate change effects or regulatory actions. as discussed above the risk of drought in the future is high and rationing and potentially outright limiting potable water for uses that do not require high quality drinking water could occur in the city (for commercial and industrial uses). the lack of potable water supply for landscape irrigation could lead to degradation of plant health and changes in the visual quality of the environment if such restrictions were to extend over long periods of time affecting the citys urban forest (the urban forest is made up of both city protected and non-protected trees). the lack of a sustainable supply for other non-potable uses (e.g. toilet flushing) could result in a health and safety concern. the continued importation of water will require energy usage which is associated with the emission of greenhouse gas emissions. there will be no opportunity to reduce climate-change related effects if the project were not implemented. since the project is designed in such a way to allow future interconnections with neighboring communities these communities (including east palo alto) will not have additional future supply options. the rwqcp will continue to discharge over 900 afy of treated wastewater into san francisco bay and will not reduce the net input of chemical constituents entering the bay if this program to reuse water is not implemented. ","the project will provide over 900 afy of recycled water for irrigation and in the future potentially industrial use such as toilet flushing and commercial and light industrial cooling towers. this will offset almost 900 afy of potable water purchases from the sfpuc which can be redirected for other beneficial uses. the cost of sfpuc purchased water continues to rise dramatically. the project will save the city over $1 million in purchased water costs in 2015 rising to over $2 million by 2021. the project will also diversify the city of palo alto's supply portfolio and provide a drought proof supply of water for the future irrigation and industrial needs. typically landscape customers are the first casualty when mandatory water cutbacks are imposed. recycled water is a sustainable supply that would offset effects that could otherwise occur after prolonged droughts. thus the proposed project will benefit protected trees non-protected trees and other vegetation present in existing landscapes that make up the urban forest and contribute to the greenery of the city. the use of recycled water will free up precious potable supplies for other uses including transfers to other agencies in need of additional supplies to meet population and economic growth. the development of a robust recycled water program including distribution infrastructure and capital investments at the rwqcp is an initial step in the development of an indirect potable reuse program. with the implementation of this project rwqcp and its partners will reduce the wastewater constituent mass loadings to the san francisco bay and will provide long-term environmental and economic benefits to the community. the project could include collaboration with other agencies to reduce current salinity levels to improve water quality. improvements in water quality will improve recycled water distribution and acceptance.

"ebmud - pretreatment facilities ","ebmud's primary operating configuration involves treatment of high quality mokelumne river water at its in-line treatment plants. treatment of lesser quality supplemental supply sources is not possible at the in-line plants as currently configured. pretreatment facilities constructed at one or more in-line plants would greatly enhance ebmud's water treatment flexibility and potentially offer greater opportunities to treat and convey water to other agencies via interties.

","installation of pretreatment facilities at ebmud's walnut creek water treatment plant (wcwtp) would provide greater flexibility to treat raw water of varying sources and qualities. the wcwtp is one of 3 in-line water treatment plants operated by ebmud. it treats high quality raw water from pardee reservoir conveyed by aqueducts to wcwtp. the addition of pretreatment systems at wcwtp have been contemplated for many years to allow the treatment of pardee water that experiences excursions of reduced raw water quality from time to time. as part of the wcwtp improvement project of 2001 accommodations were made at the wcwtp to allow the future installation of pretreamtment systems. since 2001 ebmud has successfully partnered with the sacramento county water agency (scwa) to construct the freeport regional water project (frwp). the frwp via water contracts with the us bureau of reclamation provides supplemental supply when ebmud's normal mokelumne supply runs low. the frwp also offers opportunities to contract with neighboring water agencies to convey 'transfer water' through ebmud's distribution system to them via interties. as well an intertie on ebmud's raw water system with the contra costa water district (ccwd) could provide opportunities for ebmud to store water at los vaqueros (lv) reservoir and treat and convey water to neighoboring agencies to improve water supply reliability for the bay area. another potential project under investigation currently is the use of lv optimize to water produced at a future regional desalination facility. one key restriction of the current system to treat and convey water for the benefit of neighboring agencies is the lack of suitable facilities at wcwtp that are capable of treating raw water from sources with higher than mokelumne organic loading. this project would investigate the installation of facilities at wcwtp to treat waters other than mokelumne water. membrane filtraton is the most likely process to meet the given treatment objective however pilot testing will be necessary for proper process/equipment selection. ","pretreatment facilities will address the following needs: normal year raw water supply from pardee reservoir experiences water quality excursions periodically from increased organic loading primarily. pretreatment will allow ebmud the flexibility to treat this water at the wcwtp instead of being sent to ebmud's terminal reservoirs (usl and san pablo) for more expensive conventional treatment. neighboring agencies have approached ebmud to explore the concept of conveying and treating raw water for delivery to them via new or existing interties. these agencies water supplies in normal and dry years primarily due to limitations to deliver water through delta facilities. the source water used for this purpose would most likely be from the sacramento river and of reduced quality versus pardee supply. in order to treat this supply pretreatment systems are needed. ","it is too speculative to predict what critical impacts will occur if this proposal is not implemented. this is an opportunity to provide needed water supply to neighboring agencies. failure to implement the proposal may be viewed as a lost opportunity. adding pretreatment to ebmud's treatment facilities further enhances the concept of regional reliability among water agencies. ","this project will allow greater flexibility for ebmud to treat raw water sources of varying water qualities for the benefit of ebmud and other bay area agencies who could receive treated water wheeled through ebmud's distribution system and interties. adding pretreatment to ebmud's treatment facilities further enhances the concept of regional water reliability including opportunities to increase local groundwater conjunctive storage projects. this project will allow the treatment of water that cannot now be treated at ebmud's in-line treatment plants.

","water quality improvements: control and remove sediment by controling stormwater flows and erosive velocities; stormwater improvements: control flood waters and erosion damage; habitat protection and restoration: protect and restore existing habitat for endangered and protective species(including existing salmon populations)and recreation activities in aquatic park; flood protection: protect existing urban areas by controling chronic flooding conditions including aquatic park and san francisco bay; and related to disadvantaged community: a portion of the flood protection provided by these projects protect chronic flood prone areas located within disadvantaged community areas within the city of berkeley. ","the watershed managemant plan (wmp) presents an integrated and sustainable strategy for managing urban water resources. it is meant to guide future city efforts in promoting a healthier balance between the urban environment and the natural ecosystem. the document is arranged by various topic areas providing an overview of current city activities and making recommendations for improvements. the wmp should be considered a document that will evolve over time as new information is gathered and analyzed technologies advance and regulatory requirements change. berkeley is a densely built-out city comprised of 11 watersheds wholly or partially within city limits. all watersheds in berkeley eventually drain to the san francisco bay which is an important economic engine and an internationally recognized natural resource. each watershed is unique with various mixtures of: land uses demographic communities and remaining aquatic and wildlife habitats. chapter 2 provides an overview of watershed characteristics as well as common issues associated with urban settings. these issues include high rates and volumes of stormwater runoff (flooding) stormwater pollution and degradation of creeks. the wmp looks at addressing water quality flooding and the preservation of creeks and habitats using multi-objective approaches where possible. this entails supplementing the existing engineering storm drain infrastructure with greener approaches that mimic natural hydrologic processes including filtration and infiltration by solid and plants. chapter 3 discusses various green retrofit measures appropriate for the public right-of-way as well as for public and private property. these green approaches also provide opportunities for the collection and non-potable re-use of stormwater. additional discussion of water quality programs and recommendations are provided in chapter 4. there are an estimated 8 miles of open creeks in the city. only 7% of this is on public lands the remainder flows through private properties. there are about 6.5 miles of creek culverts with about 60% on public property. there is little data available on the physical conditions of both creeks and creek culverts thus one of the primary recommendations for additional information gathering. further discussion of the benefits functions and associated habitats of creeks is provided in chapter 5 which also articulates the city's regulatory roles and the distinction between creek culverts and storm drainpipes. there are about 93 miles of storm drain pipelines under the public right-of-way throughout the city much of which is nearing or past its design life expectancy. chapter 6 discusses the public storm drain pipe infrastructure and how the city approaches its management. additional information gathering is needed to assess the physical conditions and hydraulic capacities of these facilities. maintenance programs are further discussed in chapter 7. for wmp development city council approved funding for the hydraulic modeling of the potter and codorinices watersheds (chapter 8). these two watersheds represent the full range of the drainage spectrum in berkeley. the codorinices watershed is drained by one of the most open creeks remaining in the east bay while the potter watershed (the largest in the city) is drained exclusively by storm drain pipes. the modeling results were used to develop capitol improvement recommendations for both watersheds. these recommendations call for an innovative combination of conventional measures (such as pipe enlargement) and green right-of-way retrofits to treat slow and potentially re-use stormwater. these measures called green infrastructure include right-of-way landscaping underground temporary storage piping permeable surfacing and trash capture devices. implementing wmp recommendation will require coordination among city departments; participation and support from the public; partnerships with stakeholders; gathering and analyses of information; and financial resources. chapter 9 provides four funding scenarios with a corresponding level of wmp implementation associated for each. ","the mission of the watershed management plan (wmp) is to promote a healthier balance between the urban environment and the natural ecosystem including the san francisco bay. the wmp serves to guide the development enhancement and implementation of specific actions and improvements that will help to provide much needed flood protection in the lower areas of the city and improve water quality by controlling erosion and other sources of sediment within the project areas. ","if the two recommended projects in the watershed master plan are not completed large amounts of sediments from natural erosion in the upper watershed areas will continue to clog codornices and potter creeks and undetained storm flows will continue to cause chronic flooding problems in the city's western areas which impact water quality and continued degradation of habitat throughout including disadvantages community areas in the city of berkeley. ","headwater tributaries and lower stream corridors provide and convey fresh water sources for humans and wildlife both through the conveyance of runoff and exchanges with undrlying aquifers. improved creek vegetation corridors can protect and enhance water quality by removing toxins such as oils herbicides aqnd pesticides and excess nutrients and sediments from influent water. flood control protections help to improve water quality by reducing overland surface water flows over ompervious surface areas (streets) during storm events a healthy creek corridor and stormwater detention facilites can detain stormflow volumes and reduce flow velocities thereby moderating flloding and protecting downstream areas wildlife habitat- structural complexity and rejuvenation are maintained by flooding and channel improvements contributing to the diversity of wildlife species in raparian corridors. wildlife utilizes these corridors for roosting breeding foraging and refuge. recreation opportunities-habitat restoration along creeks can include trails and other recreation opportunites to enhance the communities enjoyment of the areas such as bicycling walking jogging and bird watching.

"350 home and garden challenge bay area ","the purpose of this project is to build upon and replicate our widely successful 350 home and garden challenge to the 9 bay area counties increasing community engagement and multi-stakeholder collaborations that result in significant homescale water savings stormwater mitigation waste water recycling and habitat restoration. the 350 home and garden challenge is a community-wide challenge which inspires collaborative action and creates public and private models which conserve and reuse water save energy and grow food. our planned expansion of this program involves the following: deepen our impact in local watersheds; further develop the 350 challenge model and toolkit; provide technical and financial support and coordination for the replication of this program throughout the bay area. ","sonoma; marin; napa; contra costa; alameda; san francisco "," ","07/1/13 ","9/30/15 "," ","the 350 home and garden challenge provides resources education and implementations support which inspires action in each of the following areas. drinking water supply: promotion of water conservation practices such as lawn transformation and greywater use and rainwater catchment. water quality improvement: promotion of organic landscape practices that reduce use of toxic pesticides and herbicides. water reuse/recycling: installation of greywater systems. stormwater improvements: installation of rain gardens and bioswales promotion of downspout disconnection and promotion of landscape practices that build soil and reduce runoff. groundwater benefits: above-mentioned stormwater improvements to also recharge groundwater and reduce toxins in our watersheds. infiltration: promotion of above mentioned practices which increase onsite infiltration at model public and private landscapes. habitat protection and restoration: promotion of practices and creation of model projects which emphasize planting native and beneficial plants which create and enhance ecosystem function in home and neighborhood landscapes. flood protection: using above practices and strategies such as rain gardens to decrease runoff and increase infiltration of stormwater. related to dac: we will be targeting projects and groups in disadvantaged communities and providing technical and financial support. ","our core concept is the expansion of a proven program that inspires significant citizen action and diverse stakeholder collaboration towards achieving multiple irwmp goals while creating public and private examples of sustainability and integrated water management. over three years in sonoma county the 350 challenge has inspired over 3000 home and garden actions; the creation of dozens of model projects and over 30 media features on local partners and projects to name a few impacts. one outcome includes registered projects resulting in over 200000 square feet of turf transformation. in 2013-2014 we will: deepen the impact of the 350 home and garden challenge in the north bay region specifically in the petaluma river and sonoma creek watersheds; refine our 350 challenge toolkit; provide further training and support to groups already implementing the program in marin contra costa and alameda counties; recruit train and provide support to new groups in the other 5 bay area counties. in 2014-2015 we will: provide assistance technical support and advanced training to partner organizations in the bay area to build upon the previous years success while gathering data to assess impacts of model delivery to communities. in building up to the 350 challenge weekend daily acts and partner groups will conduct educational and skill-building workshops events and tours in addition to soliciting model projects. we will work with water agencies resource conservation districts and community partners to transform public lawns into model water-wise landscapes; and to inspire and train citizens to transform water-intensive lawns install greywater systems rainwater catchment systems and rain gardens. in the process we will promote the use of local water conservation incentive programs and share innovative programs we have developed. one such example are the citizen-powered greywater system installation programs we have worked with the cities of petaluma cotati and santa rosa on recently resulting in the largest greywater installation course in the u.s. with 27 greywater systems being installed in one weekend. ","citizens and agencies are easily overwhelmed by the scale of social environmental and economic challenges we face. one easy to overlook answer to this is the power of lots of small and integrated solutions. by focusing on thousands of citizen-powered actions in a way that aligns non-profit business and government agencies we achieve big results in an affordable way that empowers citizens utilizes existing conservation and stormwater programs and resources and strengthens our collaborative fiber. what this results in is thousands of citizens educated and engaged through tours workshops installations and media features. it results in greater household water conservation and use of local conservation programs. it results in more rain gardens greywater systems and cisterns installed saving water infiltrating stormwater and providing emergency water supply. by creating and promoting integrated landscapes which provide a diversity of benefits while mimicking ecosystem function it results in more resilient gardens households and neighborhoods. all of this leads to a positive cycle of behavior change and engagement. in a decade of running these programs and three years of the 350 challenge we have seen a significant degree of the objectives met in many of the irwmp goals and we've received requests from non-profits throughout the bay area to collaborate and implement this program. this has led us from installing one greywater system to nearly 100 greywater systems and from sheet mulching one public lawn to working with the city of petaluma which has now provided resources to sheet mulch 400000 square feet of turf saving millions of gallons of water a year. a vital need this project addresses is for citizen-powered actions that are collaborative and catalyze movement towards implementing integrated water solutions at scale. ","based upon actual registered actions and projects in sonoma county and contra costa county for the 2012 350 home and garden challenge we estimate the following critical impacts if this program is not implemented: thousands of citizens across the bay area will not be engaged and educated about water conservation and stormwater practices they can implement at home and local programs they can utilize; over 100 local projects to sheet mulch lawns install rain gardens rainwater catchment systems and greywater systems will not happen; dozens of groups in each county will miss a community-wide opportunity to collaborate; dozens of media features which reach millions of readers educating them about these programs models and actions will not occur. all of this will result in a less aware empowered and engaged citizenry a less connected and integrated group of community agencies less actual on the ground models of sustainability and integrated water management from backyards and front yards to city hall. ","i. water supply: for every laundry to landscape system installed 5-8 thousand gallons of water are reused in landscape irrigation. greywater system installation also allows this water to be recharged into our ground water basins reconnecting people and their homes to their watershed. additionally we have consistently observed that utilizing greywater leads to other conservation practices in peoples homes. for each square foot of lawn transformed there is an annual water savings of 25 gallons per square foot in addition to the reduction in pesticide and herbicide use. in 2012 alone the 350 home and garden challenge transformed 95717 sq ft of lawn saving an estimated 1000000 + gallons of water annually. so far in 2012 over 85 greywater systems have been registered from our educational installation workshops which will save approximately 500000 gallons of water per year. for every 1000 sq ft of roof utilized in rainwater catchment up to 600 gallons of water is saved per inch of rainfall. through implementing a diversity of water harvesting strategies there is the potential to use and recharge 14400 gallons of water each year. additionally when residents apply these techniques they often become much more engaged and share their models with neighbors friends and coworkers creating a multiplier effect. : in addition to the direct impacts to conservation and supply the techniques described above directly impact water quality reducing use of toxic products such as pesticides and herbicides. additionally with greywater systems residents are recommended to utilize cleaning agents that are biodegradable non toxic and free of sodium and boron. through this program we educate citizens about rain gardens and redirecting roof and site runoff and how to build healthy; we provide installation workshops at model sites in each community. this has a lasting impact beyond just flood and stormwater management by creating ongoing opportunities to educate hundreds of neighbors friends and community members at each site. by being involved in these programs and experiencing a more holistic and integrated way to solve our resource problems people become more empowered and proactively engaged. they link up with other people and groups with shared interests which sustains their engagement.

","the napa river is one of the only large watersheds in the san francisco bay area which remains in a rural state. the napa river has been rated as one of five anchor watersheds for salmonid habitat restoration (cemar 2006). with agricultural uses protected and urbanization limited by local zoning the napa river has the potential for restoration with long-term benefits to riparian and aquatic habitats. steelhead trout and chinook salmon spawn and rear in the drainage with chinook primarily using the river channel. in 2007 the california land stewardship institute (clsi) received funding from the california state water resources control board and napa county (measure a) to prepare a habitat enhancement and water quality improvement plan for nine miles of the napa river between the oakville cross road bridge and the oak knoll avenue bridge. the oakville to oak knoll reach suffers from channel incision with bank collapse erosion of (riffles bars pools important to salmonids and a reduced riparian corridor due to the lack of a functional floodplain. as the river erodes its bed and deepens the 25 foot banks collapse directly contributing fine sediment to the river and impairing beneficial uses. the incision of the main river channel is now progressing up tributaries increasing erosion and loss of habitat. there are four large municipal dams on major tributaries to the napa river. dams block sediment movement and release flood water that has a greater capacity to erode the river channel. at the yountville cross road in the middle of the project reach over 50% of the watershed of the napa river is behind one of these four large dams. the dams affect the supply of spawning gravel and channel erosion. additionally prior to settlement parts of the project area of the napa river were dominated by wetlands fed by distributary channels from alluvial fans on tributaries. over time the distributary channels were converted to more efficient drainage channels and the wetlands were drained and farmed. removal of vegetation and gravel bars elimination of multiple river channels and riprap bank stabilization also took place along the mainstem. extensive data collection fieldwork and analysis informed the final concept plan. lidar topographic data for the napa river from napa county was collected and 103 cross-sections across the napa river from bank top to bank top were surveyed. geomorphic features were mapped using a combination of handheld gps and mapping directly onto topographic base maps. changes in the width and form of the channel the loss of secondary channels changes in the amount of exposed gravel and the width of the riparian corridor were reviewed on historic aerial photographs. a riparian ecosystem assessment was completed by defining geomorphic units for mapping vegetation mapping riparian vegetation by species and size class and analyzing biodiversity size class dominance and successional stages. the relative number of the four size classes and distribution of size classes over different morphological areas in the corridor indicate regeneration level and ecological successional processes. the mapping found that in a number of locations there was little to no regeneration of riparian growth largely due to the incision in the channel and the high velocity flows. a fish habitat assessment was also completed. there are 29 native and 22 non-native fish species that occur in the freshwater and brackish habitats of the napa river basin. habitat typing surveys were conducted in accordance with the methodology presented in the california salmonid stream habitat restoration manual. the restoration plan will widen the river channel and recreate floodplains and secondary channels in select locations giving the napa river a morphology closer to its presettlement condition. by widening the river channel and restoring floodplains ecological processes can create a diverse set of habitats including salmon habitat and reduce erosion of the river channel. restoration areas are structured in four large nodes where large areas of a variety of habitats will be created. the oakville node is in an area where the river channel is already wide and has a diverse set of habitats. a 6.8 acre set of restoration areas will reduce bank erosion and create 4.2 acres of new riparian floodplain. the yountville node encompasses approximately 53 acres and will create new floodplain wetlands set back eroding banks and recreate wetland/upland habitat complexes. the old hopper creek habitat node encompasses 30 acres and will restore secondary channels setback eroding banks. recreate riparian floodplains and wetlands. restoration at the oak knoll node will focus on the confluence of dry creek and the napa river and restore 7.7 acres of riparian floodplain and secondary channels. much of the restoration will be carried out on private land where landowners have set aside a portion of their property for restoration. areas of the napa river ecological reserve dominated by non-native invasive plants will also be restored. in total implementation of the oakville to oak knoll restoration project will cover 97 acres and create 80.6 acres of new riparian and channel habitats. additionally a total of 865000 cubic yards of fine sediment will be graded from locations where it can erode and become a pollutant providing a major water quality improvement. napa county has began the environmental review and permitting for the oakville to oak knoll plan in september 2011 with funds from the environmental protection agency and napa county measure a. arundo donax removal from the upper 4 miles of the reach has also been funded and is underway. napa county has also started final design for approximately half of the restoration area and will complete design in 2013. ","the oakville to oak knoll project fulfills a need to provide high quality anadromous fish habitat in a watershed with the physical features to sustain this habitat over time and thus contribute to the recovery of these listed species. both steelhead trout and chinook salmon inhabit the napa river and will benefit from this project. there are few watersheds in the sf bay area that are not urban and have the features needed to sustain productive salmonid habitats. the napa river watershed is primarily rural and agricultural and as such retains near natural processes of infiltration and runoff. the proposed project will create large areas of the habitats needed for recovery of these species. the project will focus on a sustainable approach to river restoration by making changes that allow for natural geomorphic processes and ecological succession processes. this project also fulfills a need to implement the fine sediment tmdl for the napa river to improve water quality in the river and san pablo bay. the tmdl identifies channel erosion as a major source of loading and this project will significantly reduce this source while also enhancing and creating habitat for listed salmonids and numerous other wildlife species. ","the effects of the incision of the main river channel will continue to progress up tributaries increasing erosion and loss of habitat and exacerbating water quality problems. threatened and endangered species will continue to decline. ",": by widening the river channel and slowing the velocity of the flow groundwater recharge will increase. : reduction in fine sediment delivery the project will provide a major improvement in water quality. a total of 865000 cubic yards of fine sediment will be graded from locations where it can erode and become a pollutant. the napa river tmdl for fine sediment identifies channel erosion as a major source of this pollutant and recommends channel widening and floodplain creation to reduce this source of sediment. this project would provide for needed improvements in water quality. : reduction in the intensity and velocity of large flood events widening the channel will slow flood flows for the 2 and possibly 5 year frequency flood events. : this project involves numerous private agricultural and residential landowners who are willingly dedicating land to the restoration effort. in addition this project will restore portions of the napa river ecological reserve that are currently dominated with invasive non-native species and no longer providing native habitats for fish and wildlife. as part of the project a benefit assessment district is proposed that will provide funds to the napa county flood control district to manage both the created habitat areas and existing habitat areas along the 9 mile river reach and remove invasive non native palnts and repair bank erosion sites while maintaining large wood in the channel. additionally a technical advisory group of agencies landowners local environmental groups and scientists will over see the project design and increase their knowledge of large scale restoration projects.

","pinole creek is tidally influenced. it was channelized in the 1960s by the corps of engineers. the traditional corps design called for the removal of channel meanders and vegetation construction of a uniform trapezoidal bank structure and over deepening of the channel invert in the tidally influenced portions. this is how the channel operated for nearly 50 years. with the passage of proposition 13 in 1977 tax levels in this watershed were frozen at the prior years' amount which had been set at zero that year because it had accumulated a small fund balance. this meant that the watershed had zero revenue but an ongoing operations and maintenance responsibility. as expected maintenance has been (and continues to be) minimal. the corps' constructed over-deepened channel bottom was not dredged and filled in with sediment to reach an equilibrium condition. in 2004 the flood control district local cities regional experts watershed stakeholders and the public responded with the creation of the pinole creek vision plan which laid out a new vibrant vision for the creek. this included restoring the design level of flood protection preserving and increasing in-channel and stream-side habitat and keeping the equilibrium channel rather than dredging. the pinole creek phase i demonstration project implemented this vision in a very visible portion of the creek and has been used to continue to build community support for expansion both upstream and downstream. this restoration project is that expansion. the corps has periodically worked on the planning of an ecosystem restoration project under their continuing authorities section 1135 program. however federal funding of the program has been spotty making progress a challenge. one solid work product from that partnership has been the existing conditions report recently drafted by the corps' consultant atkins. ","if the restoration project is not implemented pinole creek will continue to languish with poor habitat. pinole creek currently supports a small population of steelhead and rainbow trout. the limited development in the upper two thirds of the watershed (it's owned by east bay municipal utilities district as watershed lands) and the relative ease of removing the few in-stream fish passage barriers makes pinole creek an excellent fisheries restoration opportunity. ","creation of adjacent wetlands creates opportunities for natural stormwater treatment processes. the restoration project specifically contains components that restore the design level of flood protection. the net result is lowered flood risk to the surrounding community. this project will provide resource stewardship through the watershed management habitat protection and restoration and improving recreational opportunities.

","sf; marin; sonoma; napa; solano; contra costa; alameda; santa clara; san mateo "," ","ongoing ","tbd "," ","green infrastructure is a broad term used to describe a variety of \"green solutions\" to problems historically solved with \"harder infrastructure.\" over the past decade public agencies have gravitated towards green infrastructure because of the many positive benefits it produces. however the ability to shift from \"hard\" to \"green\" methods is constrained by lack of tools resources and data specifically designed for the bay area. local officials need local information to feel confident about the potential success of public investments. below are some of the benefits epa has recognized about green infrastructure that are pertinent for irwmp:  cleaner water  vegetation green space and water reuse reduce the volumes of stormwater runoff and in combined systems the volume of combined sewer overflows as well as reduce concentrations of pollutants in those discharges.  enhanced local water supplies  most green infiltration approaches involve allowing stormwater to percolate through the soil where it recharges the groundwater and the base flow for streams thus ensuring adequate water supplies for humans and more stable aquatic ecosystems. in addition capturing and using stormwater conserves potable water supplies amd has the potential of replacing all outdoor uses of potable water for landscape irrigation.  cleaner air  trees and vegetation improve air quality by filtering many airborne pollutants and can help reduce the amount of respiratory illness. transportation and community planning and design efforts that facilitate shorter commute distances and the ability to walk to destinations will also reduce vehicle emissions.  reduced urban temperatures  summer city temperatures can average 10f higher than nearby suburban temperatures. high temperatures are also linked to higher ground level ozone concentrations. vegetation creates shade reduces the amount of heat absorbing materials and emits water vapor  all of which cool hot air. limiting impervious surface and using light colored impervious surfaces (e.g. porous concrete) also mitigate urban temperatures.  moderate the impacts of climate change  climate change impacts and effects vary regionally but green infrastructure techniques provide adaptation benefits for a wide array of circumstances conserving and reusing water promoting groundwater recharge reducing surface water discharges that could contribute to flooding. in addition there are mitigation benefits such as reduced energy demands and carbon sequestration by vegetation.  source water protection  green infrastructure practices provide pollutant removal benefits thereby providing some protection for both ground water and surface water sources of drinking water. in addition green infrastructure provides groundwater recharge benefits.  community benefits  trees and plants improve urban aesthetics and community livability by providing recreational and wildlife areas. studies show that property values are higher when trees and other vegetation are present.  cost savings  green infrastructure may save capital costs associated with paving creating curbs and gutters building large collection and conveyance systems and digging big tunnels and centralized stormwater ponds; operations and maintenance expenses for treatment plants pumping stations pipes and other hard infrastructure; energy costs for pumping water around; cost of treatment during wet weather; and costs of repairing the damage caused by stormwater such as streambank restoration.

","city watersheds of sonoma valley is a component of a parent project in the sonoma valley identified as the sonoma valley integrated water management program. the city watersheds project is comprised of six elements located in the nathanson creek and fryer creek sub-watersheds of sonoma creek which cover approximately 80% of the city of sonoma. the six proposed project elements are listed below and then described in detail. multi-objective detention basins fryer creek improvements at macarthur street city water supply well replacement stream maintenance and restoration nathanson creek protection from sewer southeast sonoma stormwater system retrofit element 1: multi-objective detention basins this project element will create multiple offline storage and/or detention basins located on publicly owned parks schools and open space in the nathanson and fryer subwatersheds possibly sonoma valley high school and montini open space preserve. landowner partners may include the city of sonoma sonoma county agricultural preservation and open space district sonoma valley unified school district and sonoma county water agency. the basins will provide floodwater detention and groundwater recharge and cumulatively store at least 20af. these are anticipated to be off-line basins though underground facilities may be considered if necessary. the facilities will capture and detain/retain direct storm water surface runoff and storm drain diversion. this element and element 2 will provide 10 year flood hazard reduction along most of fryer creek and incremental flood reduction along nathanson creek. basin design will maximize passive infiltration to the deep zone aquifer wherever practical offsetting in some measure the effects of a declining groundwater table and saline intrusion from san pablo bay. basin design will also consider the following:  basins will have a low profile to maintain current land uses and minimize or avoid adverse visual impacts.  working with the public agency landowners the basins will be developed in a manner consistent with land management plans and include pursuit of opportunities to meet objectives of those plans. for example element design may include developing preserving or enhancing agricultural land uses wetland features or recreational uses.  each site is highly visible and publicly accessible creating the possibility for effective education. interpretative educational signs will be included to convey how the project benefits the community and the watershed.  public access facilities such as walking/hiking trails and viewpoints will be included as appropriate.  wherever appropriate careful revegetation with native plant species will enhance wildlife habitat and provide additional education for visitors. element 2: fryer creek improvements at macarthur street this element will replace the culvert carrying fryer creek under macarthur street to increase flow capacity and reduce sedimentation in a manner that supports the habitat value of the stream corridor. this element together with element 1 will provide 10 year flood protection to most of the fryer creek watershed. habitat value will be enhanced by removing invasive species and installing native plantings. the replacement culvert may be installed at a lower elevation reducing the existing ponding condition just upstream of the culvert during the rainy season if it reduces flood hazards and sediment deposition and is acceptable to the community. this improvement is identified by the city as being the most cost-effective capital improvement project with flood reduction benefits for the area. element 3: city water supply well replacement to improve the reliability of the local municipal water supply and proactively respond to the effects of nearby saline groundwater intrusion and areas of groundwater depression within the city watersheds this element will replace and relocate an aging city of sonoma municipal well along with a nearby monitoring well. the new municipal well is to be used in place of one of the aging city wells but will be designed to also allow for studying aquifer storage and potential for recovery in the watershed (asr). a smaller diameter monitoring well would also be installed near the well to monitor changes during asr as well as properly identify the aquifer characteristics in the new well. the new location of the well is expected to be within publicly-owned open space or park areas. the well would include a small pumphouse and appurtenances. an all-weather access road and pipeline would be required to convey water to the citys distribution system. element 4: stream maintenance and restoration in accordance with sonoma county water agencys stream maintenance program this element will include invasive species removal and native planting along reaches of fryer and nathanson creeks. the work will also include sediment removal along fryer and nathanson creeks including development of a low flow channel to enhance fish passage and sediment transport in the streams. element 5: nathanson creek protection from sewer two existing sewer pipelines that cross nathanson creek are exposed and vulnerable to damage from storm flows increasing the risk of raw sewage spills into the creek. nathanson creek supports both steelhead trout and chinook salmon. this element will modify the existing damaged concrete encasements to increase the integrity of the pipeline protect water quality and the fishery and reduce the impediment to fish passage. element 6: southeast sonoma stormwater system retrofit the southeast portion of the city of sonoma is anticipated to be developed in the coming years. prior to additional urbanization of the area -- while feasible opportunities still exist -- this element will re-route water away from the existing culvert-based drain systems to drain systems that are unlined or designed to infiltrate flow. such retrofits will recharge groundwater and enhance water quality. this element will modify at minimum the existing 5th street east stormdrain. this culvert discharges year-round flow to schell creek at peru road south of the city of sonoma. historically the flows  some of which originate from groundwater springs north of east macarthur street - were not conveyed in a stormdrain and were allowed to infiltrate into the ground via open ditches. this project element will pursue opportunities to restore the infiltration of flows that are currently contained within the stormdrain. ","over the past 50 years the sonoma valley has experienced rapid population growth and land use changes. this project is designed to address multiple interlocking water-related problems arising from these changes. the problems include groundwater aquifer decline flooding and sedimentation resulting from changes to runoff patterns dependence on water imported from the russian river and severe declines in riparian forest anadromous steelhead and salmon and other aquatic-dependent species and habitats. people in sonoma valley are highly concerned about water supply and water quality but generally they do not realize how their everyday actions affect water conditions. groundwater levels have declined in some portions of the sonoma valley. groundwater pumping depressions have developed in areas southeast of the city of sonoma and southwest of el verano. there has been a significant increase in irrigated agriculture predominantly vineyards which rely heavily on groundwater. domestic agricultural and urban water use is projected to increase placing further demands on the current groundwater supply that will likely result in lower groundwater levels in the future. these declines in groundwater level may result in increased extraction costs well deepening or replacements costs groundwater quality degradation including salinity intrusion land subsidence decreases in streamflow and damage to multiple fish and wildlife species. achieving sustainable groundwater use is important as well because sonoma valley relies on water imports from the russian river which may decline in future. flood hazards increasingly threaten the community economically and environmentally. damage to private and public property is caused by inadequate flood conveyance systems. culverts creeks and streams are choked by sediment buildup and invasive plant species. many years after their construction sewer pipelines lie exposed and vulnerable to damage or rupture during storm events which could result in the release of raw sewage. these exposed pipelines also impede fish passage. principal causes of flooding in the city of sonoma are perched channel conditions encroachment of development onto floodplains and inadequately-sized storm drainage infrastructure such as bridges and culverts. the city of sonoma is built on the alluvial fan deposited by nathanson creek arroyo seco and fryer creek. through years of flooding and sediment deposition the banks of nathanson creek at the northern end of the city have formed natural levees. floodplains adjacent to streams with natural levees gently slope away from the stream channel resulting in banks that are higher than in surrounding development. as a result when these channels overtop their banks floods can inundate a large area. according to flood emergency management agency (fema) mapping nathanson creek is able to contain the 100year flood with minor overbank flooding in some locations. however due to its perched conditions above adjacent lands significant flooding can occur during larger storms. flooding in this watershed is caused by creek flooding overland flow causing street and structure flooding and storm drain system related flooding. overland flooding also contributes to flooding at the southern extent of nathanson creek in the vicinity of a high school and the citys commercial center. flooding in the fryer creek watershed is primarily driven by flooding of fryer creek and undersized storm drainage infrastructure. areas of localized flooding result from fryer creek not being able to contain the 25-year 24-hour event within its banks. more extensive flooding occurs during the 100-year 24-hour event. element 2 is a recommended capital improvement project in the city of sonomas storm drain master plan. ","if city watersheds of sonoma valley is not implemented watershed degradation and flood hazards will continue to occur. the cost to extract groundwater will increase as groundwater levels decline. wells will need to be drilled deeper into the aquifer or replaced entirely and the reliability of the local municipal water supply will become less stable. groundwater quality will also decline evidenced by salinity intrusion potential land subsidence (cones of depression) decreases in streamflow and further losses of salmonids riparian forests wetlands and other biodiversity assets. chronic water shortages would be particularly devastating to this agricultural economy. without this project flooding will continue to worsen within the city and downstream. ","city watersheds of sonoma valley will provide both flood hazard protection and groundwater benefits within the boundaries of the city of sonoma. it will make strides towards meeting the water supply water quality and flood hazard reduction needs of the community while at the same time improving watershed function by enhancing the connection between surface and groundwater systems. i. water supply groundwater represents a large percentage of urban and agricultural water supply in sonoma valley. elements 1 and 6 both recharge groundwater with stormwater. element 3 directly improves the reliability of the local municipal water supply and proactively responds to the effects of saline groundwater intrusion. elements 1 3 and 6 protect groundwater quality by slowing salinity intrusion and protect surface water quality by slowing stormwater runoff and moderating flood flows. the protection of sewer stream crossings in element 5 will prevent the fisheries wildlife and public health hazards of raw sewage spills into local waterways. the facilities provided in element 1 will serve as combined flood detention and groundwater recharge facilities capturing and detaining/retaining direct storm water surface runoff and stormdrain diversion. in combination with the improvements in element 2 10 year flood hazard reduction along most of fryer creek and incremental flood reduction along nathanson creek will be provided. in element 4 stream maintenance of select reaches of the nathanson and fryer watershed will provide additional flood protection. by slowing water deliveries to streams element 6 may reduce flooding downstream of the city of sonoma. iv. resource stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) this package of interlocking project elements illustrates the power of partnerships to accomplish watershed-friendly water management. potential sites for element 1 include popular public recreational facilities including parks walking trails through protected open space (possibly montini open space preserve) and athletic fields (possibly at sonoma valley high school). these provide tangible opportunities for the community to learn first-hand about watershed management by seeing how these practices can be integrated into daily life. element 1 includes construction of interpretive signs and viewpoints connected to popular trails within blocks of sonomas historic much-visited plaza. to the degree possible element 1 design will incorporate and increase historic or degraded habitats such as wetlands historic agriculture and riparian forest. in element 2 and element 4 aquatic and riparian habitat protection and restoration are an important part of stream maintenance and enhancement practices. these include removing invasive plant species and sediment build up restoring natural habitat by planting native species and improving anadromous fish passage. both sites are bordered by public walking trails and have neighborhood constituencies who will be involved in planning planting cleanup and maintenance. elements 1 2 and 4 may involve substantial volunteer effort as all three elements have a track record of sustaining committed volunteers. hands-on experience successfully teaches community members about ecology water supply and conservation and watershed functions. elements that potentially reduce sonoma valleys dependence on russian river water imports (elements 1 3 6) contribute to stream health and fisheries recovery in that north coast region watershed.

","the city of pittsburg owns and operates a 32 mgd wtp that was last expanded and upgraded in 1990 and is in need of improvements to mitigate current operating problems prepare to reliably treat the flow rates for which it was originally designed and meet current and future drinking water regulations. the wtp is located in and serves the city of pittsburg much of which is defined as a disadvantaged community. the wtp discharges spent filter backwash through three pipelines to the lower lagoon for storage and settling. settled water from the lower lagoon is recycled through the wtp. according to water quality records from 2008 to 2010 the peak daily turbidity of the recycled water often exceeds 2 nephelometric turbidity units (ntu) which is the turbidity limit recommended by the cryptosporidium action plan (cap) issued by the california department of public health (cdph) to reduce the potential for reintroduction of pathogens from recycled flows. cdph raised this issue to the city of pittsburg in a letter dated december 21 2010 and requested that the city seek solutions to mitigate the recycled water turbidity problem. additionally in the past the lagoon at the wtp site has overflowed; the last overflow occurred in march 2010 in which approximately 12 acre-feet (af) of water from the lagoon overflowed to surrounding grounds and ultimately to willow creek. the overflow water is high in aluminum manganese and iron. implementing the project specifically phase 2 described below would dedicate a portion of the lagoon for stormwater storage protecting the local environment and aquatic habitat by preventing overflows into the creek during storm events. in response to this issue the city prepared a water treatment plant improvements study which was finalized in july 2011. the study identified three phases of high priority improvements to the city's wtp. the proposed city of pittsburg wtp improvements project (project) includes the three phases of improvements described in the study. phase 1 includes the following improvement measures: influent blending and chlorine dioxide contact chlorine dioxide generation and chemical storage and chlorinator modification ammonia feed relocation and spent filter backwash treatment. phase 2 involves sludge management improvements including sedimentation basin mechanical sludge removal sludge thickening sludge dewatering and converting part of lower lagoon to a sludge lagoon). phase 3 includes the addition of a 0.5 mg backwash basin. project planning was completed through preparation of the wtp improvements study from august 2010 to july 2011 by the city of pittsburg. releasing a request for proposal (rfp) and conducting a competitive process to choose a consultant to perform design will take 3 months and can be completed immediately upon receipt of funding. design is anticipated to take approximately 12 months for each phase. after design is complete there will be a bid process to select a construction contractor. this is expected to take about 3 months. upon notice to proceed (ntp) the contractor will be begin construction. environmental documentation will take about one month; it is anticipated that a categorical exemption will be required as there will be no increase in rated capacity at the plant and improvements will be made on the existing site. the city of pittsburg's planning department can file a notice of exemption with the county clerk at any point deemed necessary. the schedule assumes the notice of exemption will be filed approximately one month prior to receipt of funding so that the wtp improvements project will be ceqa compliant upon receipt of funding. at that time design will begin immediately followed by construction. ","the need for the wtp improvements project is demonstrated in the following ways: - as previously stated the city's wtp has not been upgraded since 1990 and as the city continues to grow and while per capita water consumption has been reduced overall water use will increase the system needs to be improved and expanded in order to operate efficiently adequately treat increased flow rates and meet state and federal water quality regulations. - the city is currently not complying with the filter backwash recycling rule (fbrr) as the recycled water feed location is downstream of the rapid mix process where coagulant is added. - the wtp is not complying with the cdph cap and has been directed to seek solutions to mitigate the recycled water turbidity problem by the cdph. - currently sedimentation basins 1 and 2 and basin 3 4 and 5 operate separately as two parallel treatment trains. combining these treatment trains is needed to increase operational efficiency and overall long-term water supply reliability. - the wtp improvements are needed to address a critical water quality need of the dac served by the wtp. - in the past the lagoon at the wtp site has overflowed to surrounding grounds and ultimately to willow creek. the overflow water is high in aluminum manganese and iron. implementing phase 2 would dedicate a portion of the lagoon for stormwater storage protecting the local environment and aquatic habitat by preventing overflows into the creek during storm events. goals and objectives of the wtp improvements project include: 1. comply with cap and fbrr requirements. 2. improve operational efficiency. 3. address a critical water quality need of a dac. 4. protect the environment and habitat by preventing overflows from the lower lagoon to the creek. 5. increase water supply reliability. 6. provide stormwater and emergency overflow storage. 7. reduce reliance on delta supplies. ","if the city of pittsburg were not to upgrade the wtp it would not be able to increase use of the existing groundwater system thus relying on increased delta supply to meet customer demands. in this way the project is needed to avoid additional delta water demands. the city would continue not to comply with state and federal regulations if the project is not implemented and the lagoon could overflow into surrounding areas including willow creek further impacting local habitat. ","implementing the wtp improvements project will provide benefits primarily to the city of pittsburg water service area including the dacs within its boundary. benefits include: 1-water users will have improved water supply reliability and increased water quality protection as the wtp will comply with state and federal requirements. 2-by replacing the potassium permanganate with chlorine dioxide there will be a reduction in taste-and-odor issues and the potential for disinfection-byproduct formation. 3-this will also allow for more efficient use of groundwater from the pittsburg basin. 4-the project will also benefit the surrounding environment as well as the greater downstream bay-delta ecosystem by providing habitat and environmental protection through prevention of lagoon overflow. 5-the project will improve supply reliability throughout the region and the state by avoiding the need for additional delta supplies to meet future demands that would otherwise be met through groundwater supply from the city's wtp.

","if this program is not funded the only comprehensive monitoring program in place for tomales bay will be halted and the ability to determine long-term trends lost. if phase i is not implemented by tvcsd there is a potential for catastrophic system failure causing major stormwater contamination to coastal tributaries and tomales bay. the mouth of walker creek is a conditionally approved oyster growing area for local companies who produce oysters for the san francisco and north bay marketplace. this would be the first area affected by such a catastrophe. tomales bay is used year-round for water recreation and human health may also be at risk if such an event occurs. impacts to the marine and aquatic ecosystems are difficult to predict but these sensitive and rich communities would also be impacted if contamination were to occur. as global climate change ocean acidification and sea level rise occurs monitoring will be the basis for effective management decisions and without such a program we may lose a very important opportunity to respond to changes in tomales bay. ","n/a this project provides the benchmark for the impacts of current and future watershed management actions to improve water quality. also this project removes potential sources of contamination from accessing surface creeks and coastal waters. the tomales bay watershed water quality monitoring program is the most cost effective way to continue water quality data collection and analysis distribution of results ongoing communication with collaborators and the public. this ongoing program has been refined over the last 5 years and is the most economically effective way to continue to gather water quality data for the tomales bay watershed area. the tomales village community services district has completed a feasibility study to evaluate and document priorities and costs for continued effective treatment and handling within their service area. by phasing their efforts they will successfully proceed with the highest priority activities as they seek funding for the remaining work to be undertaken. phase i of the tvcsd plans has a direct and potentially important impact on water quality protection. this project will include phase i implementation of the tomales community village services district's plan to replace existing elements of their system to further protect groundwater creek and coastal water quality from contamination during storm events. by replacing existing manholes and lining the lift station in the town of tomales changes will be made to keep wastewater from contacting stormwater and thereby flowing into the adjacent waterbodies. the tomales bay watershed council will continue to bring together all of the partners that participated in the tomales bay integrated coastal watershed management plan. watershed priorities remain accurate today even as some of the priority projects have shifted over time. tomales bay aquatic and terrestrial habitats within its watershed and the adjacent coastal areas are recognized internationally for their unique and important qualities. these rich and valuable habitats are protected as areas of special biological significance national marine sanctuaries and are enjoyed by millions of visitors annually due to the public lands and open spaces that have been protected for use by the public. by providing ongoing water quality information we will improve our understanding of our impacts on the landscape effects of ocean acidification global climate change and thereby promote continued and improve stewardship of these resources. similarly as the tomales village community services district strives to meet current and future needs and challenges their continued commitment to sound stewardship and responsible management will protect the quality of local groundwater creeks and the coastal waters the flow to tomales bay.

","drinking water supply: anderson reservoir is used for drinking water treatment plant supply and groundwater recharge (groundwater accounts for up to 50 percent of countywide water use). this project will increase the reservoir's water supply yield by an average of 10500 acre-feet per year. water quality improvement: scvwd can use anderson reservoir to store its central valley project (cvp) supplies. when we anticipate poor summer/fall water quality conditions in san luis reservoir (the source of our cvp supplies) we take our cvp supplies in the spring and use them in the summer/fall to meeting drinking water treatment plant demands and avoid algae-laden water that is difficult to treat. restoring full operating capacity will increase the storage available to manage drinking water quality. groundwater and infiltration: as noted above anderson reservoir is used for groundwater recharge. this project will increase the availability of water for groundwater recharge. habitat protection and restoration: scvwd makes releases from anderson reservoir to provide habitat for anadromous fish downstream in coyote creek. the increase in operating capacity will increase the cold-water pool available for summer releases. ","anderson reservoir is scvwds largest reservoir providing more storage than all its other reservoirs combined. the reservoir was designed for water supply purposes though the reservoir also provides flood protection benefits through reservoir operating rules that reduce the likelihood of flooding recreation activities such as boating and fishing and environmental benefits through operations that provide suitable water flows and temperatures to benefit habitats. however scvwd is currently operating anderson reservoir at restricted capacity (61810 acre-feet of 90373 acre-feet; 68%) due to seismic stability concerns. the anderson dam seismic retrofit project makes improvements to anderson dam and its appurtenances so that the reservoir can be operated at full capacity. the project includes upstream and downstream embankment excavation and buttresses to improve seismic stability a new low-level outlet carrier pipe in an oversized tunnel to accommodate fault rupture a high-level outlet tunnel that will discharge in the spillway to provide the ability to draw down the reservoir quickly and raised spillway walls and dam crest to safely pass the probable maximum flood (pmf). attachment 1 is project's planning study report. restoring operating capacity to the reservoir will result in multiple benefits. specifically the project will: enable scvwd to put an average of 10500 acre-feet per year of additional local runoff to beneficial use for groundwater recharge and drinking water treatment plant supplyincrease the cold-water pool and increase summer releases to coyote creek by an average of 5 cubic feet per second (cfs)increase the potential to operate the anderson hydroelectric facilityincrease storage capacity by approximately 28500 acre-feet (helps adapt to droughts and extreme weather due to climate change) andreduce the need to treat algae-laden supplies from san luis reservoir by taking supplies earlier in the year and storing them in anderson reservoir for use in the summer and fall (algae can result in aesthetic concerns and/or reduced treatment plant capacity due to filter clogging). the anderson dam seismic retrofit is part of scvwds safe clean water and natural flood protection program which voters approved in 2012 with more than 70 percent of the votes. the project is also supported by local jurisdictions especially the city of morgan hill as demonstrated through outreach on scvwds capital improvement program. the federal energy regulatory commission found the methodology process and criteria for evaluating the  the staff recommended alternative (alternative no. 15) to be appropriate and well presented. santa clara county parks and recreation department partners with scvwd to provide recreational opportunities on and around the reservoir. there are multiple calenviroscreen disadvantaged communities in santa clara county including several along coyote creek in san jose. the benefits of the proposed project will benefit all of santa clara county including the disadvantaged communities. the project will benefit groundwater in the santa clara valley and llagas groundwater subbasins. scvwd is the designated casgem monitoring entity for both subbasins and both basins are covered in the board-adopted 2012 groundwater management plan. ","climate change : the project will increase operating storage capacity in anderson reservoir by approximately 28500 acre-feet. storage will help capture flows from extreme weather events (adapting to floods) and carryover flows into dry years (adapting to droughts). in additional additional storage in anderson will increase scvwds anderson hydroelectric facility generating renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. lastly the increased capacity will result in a larger cold-water pool which will help with maintain habitat downstream on coyote creek. reinforce/enhance water supply capacity: the project will provide approximately 28500 acre-feet of additional operating storage within the region. regional water reliability/long-term sustainability : the project will increase ability to use local runoff by an average of about 10500 acre-feet per year by increasing the operating storage of anderson reservoir by about 28500 acre-feet. this local supply is used for groundwater recharge and drinking water treatment plant supply (in-lieu recharge). the additional recharge will help maintain groundwater storage for use during droughts and other water shortages. the additional storage also helps scvwd optimize its imported cvp allocations by enabling the district to transfer water from san luis reservoir into anderson reservoir to avoid water quality problems and if water levels are projected to drop too low in san luis reservoir water supply outages. ","scvwd would not be able to regain about 28500 acre-feet of storage in anderson reservoir and an average of about 10500 acre-feet per year of water supply. this will reduce the ability of scvwd to adapt to climate change and will reduce water supply reliability in santa clara county. further this would reduce the amount of cold-water pool available to support downstream fisheries now and in the future. ","anderson reservoir is used for drinking water treatment plant supply and groundwater recharge that benefits all of santa clara county (groundwater accounts for up to 50 percent of countywide water use). this project will increase the reservoir's water supply yield by an average of 10500 acre-feet per year. the only alternative local supply that could deliver this average yield is potable reuse. the cost for an equivalent amount of potable reuse is about $210 million in capital costs plus $2 million in annual costs (present value of $245 million). this results in a benefit/cost ratio of about 1.4. attachment 2 (150312 board package) has more information on potable reuse costs and opportunities. attachment 3 documents the estimate water supply impact from the operating restrictions. scvwd can use anderson reservoir to store its central valley project (cvp) supplies. when we anticipate poor summer/fall water quality conditions in san luis reservoir (the source of our cvp supplies) due to low water levels (aka low point) we take our cvp supplies in the spring and use them in the summer/fall to meeting drinking water treatment plant demands and avoid algae-laden water that is difficult to treat. restoring full operating capacity will increase the storage available to manage drinking water quality. one alternative to using anderson reservoir to store water in the spring for later summer use would be to increase chemical use at scvwds drinking water treatment plants. the estimated additional treatment costs are about $600000 per low point event based on experience from 2009. scvwd makes releases from anderson reservoir to provide habitat for anadromous fish downstream in coyote creek. the increase in operating capacity will increase the cold-water pool available for summer releases. based on output from scvwds water planning and evaluation model summer flows immediately downstream of anderson reservoir will increase by an average of about 310 acre-feet per month (1850 afy) or 5 cubic feet per second. the present value of this increase is flow using $80/af (based on north bay watershed associations handbook for estimating economic benefits of environmental projects) is about $3.7 million. including this benefit value increases the benefit/cost ratio to 1.5. flows in coyote creek immediately downstream of anderson dam may jun jul aug sep oct average with restriction (af) 2546 2262 2289 2093 1777 1492 average without restriction (af) 3128 2409 2557 2464 2015 1733 difference (af) 581 147 269 371 238 241 average difference (cfs) 9 2 4 6 4 4 santa clara county parks and recreation department partners with scvwd to provide recreational opportunities on and around the reservoir. restoring full operating capacity could increase average water levels and surface area of the reservoir enabling more boating activities and increasing the aesthetics. at this point in time the benefits of increased recreation have not been quantified but they could will additional time.

","today impervious surfaces such as buildings streets and parking lots have covered most of san francisco preventing rainfall infiltration. over time creeks were buried and connected to the sewers and wetlands were filled. instead of percolating into soils runoff now travels over impervious surfaces mobilizes pollutants and washes them into the sewer system or receiving water bodies. during heavy rain events stormwater runoff can contribute to localized flooding combined sewer discharges and the degradation of surface water quality. moreover the decrease in infiltration resulting from paved surfaces contributes to groundwater depletion. while water quality protection is the fundamental driver behind stormwater management well-designed stormwater controls (i.e. green infrastructure) offer many direct and ancillary benefits. some of the direct benefits include reducing and delaying the volumes and peak flows of stormwater reaching the sewer system. volume reductions and and peak flow desynchronization can help reduce the number of storm water overflows reduces flooding and protects water quality. these types of projects can also improve the capacity and efficiency of san francisco's treatment facilities. some of the ancillary benefits include contributing to attractive civic spaces open spaces and streetscapes. green infrastructure also protects and enhances wildlife habitat and the potential to effectively integrate stormwater management into the redevelopment of historic sites. ","these early implementation projects are critical to gain public support for the ssip green infrastructure program inform the cost/benefit as utility assets and meet the goals of the city and county of san francisco to revitalize public streets create green jobs and improve wildlife habitat. ","green infrastructure includes designs (e.g. bioretention cisterns etc.) that are expected to offset the use of potable water for irrigation for existing and proposed landscapes thereby reducing overall potable water demand. other types of designs (e.g. detention basins) act as surface storage areas during storm events and can act as open spaces during dry weather. green infrastrcture treats stormwater and improves runoff to ms4 areas prior to discharge to the ocean or bay. additionally stormwater discharges to the combined sewer system potentially benefit from the managment of tss and heavy metals via green infrastructure reducing required treatment at the wastewater plants. utilization of green infrastructure across the city will likely result in a reduction of flood waters and combined sewer discharges benefiting the city and bay area residents visitors and wildlife. the urban watershed assessment (uwa) program is the planning process for the ssip and will provide recommendations for the earily implementation projects noted in this grant as well as additional future projects to be implemented over the next 20 years. a major consideration of uwa recommendations are project synergies among city departments and the public to manage natural resources improve recreational opportunities and more using watersheds as the planning units. project alternatives will be evaluated using a triple bottom line analysis to consider social environmental and finalcial benefits in a transparrent manner.
