disturbances; 3) remove areas of unnatural levels of sedimentation (deltas)
from the lagoon; 4) restore eelgrass if suitable habitat is available in

in scouring of bedforms (riffle pools and gravel bars) needed by salmonids and
loss of riparian forest and shade canopy. Channel erosion due to entrenchment
is identified as a major source of fine sediment pollution in the Napa River
and a limiting factor for salmonid habitats.  Restoration will encompass up to 20 acres of
