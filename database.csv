Alameda; Contra Costa; Solano; Napa; San Mateo; Santa Clara","","as early as 1/1/2013","24 months after start date","The San Francisco Bay Area is indisputably an urbanized region but its urban areas are ringed with rural properties ranchlands and parks. This ring of less dense development provides a transition to the more intensive farming landscapes of the inland valleys. Despite the reduced density the rural properties grazing lands and livestock facilities in this transition zone contribute significantly to water quality impairments. The watersheds for the Napa River and its tributaries like Sonoma Creek support numerous grazing and livestock operations that have been identified as pollutant sources in the adopted sediment and pathogen TMDLs. The significance of these sources is confirmed in the recently adopted RWQCB 2 conditional waiver of waste discharge for grazing operations. In Contra Costa County Marsh Creek and Kellogg Creek are 303d listed for sediments pathogens and nutrients (Kellogg) with over 100 permitted equestrian facilities in those watersheds. Alameda Creek and San Francisquito Creek (San Mateo/Santa Clara) are 303d listed for sediments evidencing similar issues in the east and south bay area. Further a dozen watershed plans from around the bay identify equestrian and livestock operations as priorities in need of technical assistance. Due to the prevelance of program need six SF Bay Area Resource Conservation Districts will collaborate to promote programming deliver technical assistance identify specific priority implementation sites and design/implement BMPs on sites that will be come demonstration sites for the livestock community while protecting water quality in priority watersheds in Alameda Contra Costa Solano Napa San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties.","","","","","","","","Ecology Action"
