"1 ","CCCSD-Concord Recycled Water Project ","Central Contra Costa Sanitary District (CCCSD) will expand its recycled water distribution system by constructing approximately 2.5 miles of pipeline in the City of Concord. Up to 34 new customers will use recycled water for landscape irrigation. The project will reduce customer potable water use by approximately 190 acre-feet per year; potable water originates from the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta.

The project area is a triangle shape framed by Hwy 680 Concord Avenue and Walnut Creek (the creek not the city.) The recycled water distribution system begins from the Buchanan Fields Golf Course (an existing recycled water customer) then down Meridian Park Blvd branch off to Burnett Galaxy Way Diamond Blvd and John Glen Drive. ","Project Type Description: This is a water recycling project that will provide the distribution system required to make available filtered and disinfected effluent from CCCSD's Water Reclamation facility for landscape irrigation in Concord. It is an extension of the CCCSD existing Zone 1 project. This project provides water quality improvements to the Suisun Bay because effluent diverted to irrigation reduces CCCSD discharge volume which reduces pollutant loading into Suisun Bay. This project reduces freshwater diversions from the Sacramento Delta thereby improving water quality. The project area is located within a disadvantaged community. ","Detailed description: The Central Contra Costa Sanitary District (CCCSD) Concord Recycled Water Project will expand its recycled water distribution system to provide recycled water to irrigation users in the City of Concord (east of the I-680 freeway and south of Buchanan Fields Airport). The project consists of constructing approximately 2.5 miles of 4  to 10  PVC and HDPE pipeline and connecting up to 34 landscape irrigation connections. Approximately 190 AFY of recycled water will be used for landscape irrigation at businesses and roadway medians. This project also includes retrofit of backflow preventers required to connect users.

Water shortages typically occur during the summer months. Therefore irrigating with recycled water reduces regional water demand during times where water shortages are most likely to occur. This improves regional water supply reliability. Water recycling is a component of Contra Costa Water District s (CCWD) long-term sustainable water supply strategy. In times of water shortages CCWD may impose water rationing. This project reduces the water demand and mitigates water shortages during drought year. CCWD water supply is from Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Using recycled water for landscape irrigation reduces demands on the Delta. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: In times of water shortages in the Contra Costa Water District s service area water rationing can be employed. The use of recycled water for landscape irrigation reduces the demand on the CCWD potable system lessening the need to ration. Customers using recycled water will not be affected by water rationing that Contra Costa Water District puts in place during water storages. ","Project Benefits: The primary benefit of this project is that it will offset 190 afy of the potable water originating from the Delta currently used for landscape irrigation. It reduces freshwater diversions from the Sacramento Delta and improves regional water supply reliability. Water reuse also reduces CCCSD discharge volume which reduces pollutant loading into Suisun Bay. Recycled water contains ammonia which fertilizes turf.

"2 ","Corte Madera Creek Watershed: Saunders Fish Barrier Removal ","Ross Taylor & Associates assessed and prioritized barriers to fish passage in the Corte Madera Creek watershed in 2006. A culvert containing an Alaskan steeppass fish ladder at the Saunders Avenue rrossing of San Anselmo Creek a tributary to Corte Madera Creek is the highest priority for treatment. An active 24-inch sewer rests on the bed of the creek immediately upstream of the box culvert. Each of these features individually would cause San Anselmo Creek to overtop the bank of the creek by about 6 inches during the 100-year event. To address both the flooding and fish passage problems requires a new bridge and rerouting the sewer so it can be buried in the stream bed. ","('North Bay';) | Marin ","37.98140742932986 | -122.57099211215973 ","When funding is obtained "," ","San Anselmo Creek at Sanders Avenue San Anselmo California ","Project Type Description: Water Quality: When flooding occurs water quality is harmed by the materials carried into the creek by the out-of-bank flows: excessive sediment gardening supplies and chemicals automotive care products and other materials typically found in garages and garden sheds. Habitat Protection and Restoration: The project would remove a barrier to passage for steelhead trout and other fishes in San Anselmo Creek. Invasive non-natives would be removed from the bank within the project area on the high school campus and native plants would be installed. Flood Protection: Replacing the bridge and relocating the sewer would remove up to 19 homes plus a portion of the Sir Francis Drake High School Campus from the 100-year flood plain of San Anselmo Creek. ","Detailed description: A full-span bridge will be constructed a 24-inch sewer and the lateral connecting Drake High School to the sewer will be relocated and a roughened channel will be installed under the new bridge. The roughened channel is necessary to avoid undercutting retaining walls that have been built by homeowners all along the right bank in the project area and on the left bank downstream of the bridge. The new configuration of the sewer and the bridge will provide capacity for the 100-year flow in San Anselmo Creek and meet NOAA Fisheries and California Department of Fish and Game criteria for passage of all age classes of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that are known to occupy the watershed. ","Project Need: Fish Passage: In the 1980s an Alaskan Steeppass fish ladder was installed and a low-flow channel constructed to provide upstream passage for adult anadromous steelhead. However the Steeppass and low-flow channel are poorly suited for providing adult steelhead passage at typical migration flows. At migration flows the hydraulic capacity of the Steeppass is overwhelmed and there is inadequate attraction flow for fish to find the outlet. At lower flows there is inadequate depth in the low-flow channel for adult steelhead to swim through. The fish passage facility also lacks a pool at the transition from the low-flow channel into the Steeppass making entry difficult. Additionally an Alaskan Steeppass does not provide passage for juvenile salmonids and is highly susceptible to plugging by debris. Replacing the fish ladder and associated concrete structures with a roughened channel will provide passage for all age classes of steelhead and coho salmon (Corte Madera Creek is critical habitat for both species although coho salmon were extirpated from the watershed by the mid-1980s). Flooding: An active 24-inch sewer that forms a low dam on the bed of the creek causes water to leave the creek channel during the 100-year event; when that happens the bridge is adequate to convey the flow that remains in the channel. Hydraulic modeling shows that if the sewer were removed from the bed of the creek then the bridge itself would cause flooding. When the water leaves the channel it floods a portion of the campus of Sir Francis Drake High School 139 Saunders Avenue and 18 properties on Agatha Court. To avoid flooding during the 100-year event the sewer must be relocated and the bridge replaced. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Flood risk will be unabated in the vicinity of the Saunders Avenue Bridge leaving many properties in the 100-year flood plain. Migrating steelhead will be unable to pass the barrier at Saunders Avenue substantially all the time. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) None ii. Water Quality The degradation of water quality caused by flooding will e reduced. This includes excessive erosion of upland areas that flood addition of household and garden chemicals to the creek when garages homes and garden sheds flood and sewage overflows that typically occur when flooding occurs and overwhelms sewers. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management The 100-year flow will be retained in the channel if the project is implemented. This would remove 20 properties from the 100-year flood plain. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The project would remove a barrier to passage for steelhead trout and other fishes in San Anselmo Creek.

"3 ","Lower Lagunitas Creek Habitat Restoration Project ","This project will implement restoration work along 4 miles of Lagunitas Creek to benefit endangered coho salmon and threatened steelhead trout. The work will enhance overwinter and floodplain habitat in the mainstem of the creek and reduce sediment loading and improve fish passage by  storm-proofing  tributary stream crossings along the Cross Marin Trail in the same reach. This project expands two existing IRWMP projects: Lagunitas Creek Winter Habitat Enhancement Implementation and Lagunitas Creek Sediment Reduction and Management Project. ","('North Bay';) | Marin ","38.0503 | -122.7602 ","01/01/2015 ","09/30/2019 ","Lagunitas Creek Marin County. The project area is a 4.1-mile reach of the mainstem of the creek and the associated tributaries located downstream of Kent Lake (see attached project location map.) ","Project Type Description: Drinking Water Supply: This project addresses water supply reliability by reducing potential vulnerabilities associated with a major water supply distribution pipeline. Water Quality Improvement: This project will reduce sediment input to creeks and enhance floodplain sediment storage addressing goals and objectives identified in the State's Lagunitas Creek Sediment TMDL. Stormwater Improvement: The project will implement road drainage improvements by sizing them for the 100 year storm thereby reducing turbidity and other adverse impacts from stormwater flows from these roads. Habitat Protection and Restoration: The project will enhance overwinter habitat for coho salmon and steelhead trout in the mainstem and adjacent floodplain of Lagunitas Creek. The project will improve habitat for endangered salmonid species by reducing fine sediment loading to fish bearing streams and in some cases removing barriers to fish passage. ","Detailed description: Lagunitas Creek supports the largest and most stable population of endangered coho salmon in Central California as well as a robust population of threatened steelhead trout. This project will restore habitat for these species by enhancing overwinter habitat and reducing fine sediment input to the creek. These are two critical implementation strategies identified to support and encourage recovery of coho and steelhead. The restoration work is identified for implementation in the Lagunitas Creek Stewardship Plan (2011 MMWD) the State and federal coho salmon recovery plans and the State s Sediment TMDL plan for Lagunitas Creek. This project expands two previously submitted IRWMP projects: Lagunitas Creek Winter Habitat Enhancement Implementation and Lagunitas Creek Sediment Reduction and Management Project. The project is detailed in two recently completed studies. Winter habitat enhancement construction sites were identified in the Lagunitas Creek Salmonid Winter Habitat Enhancement Assessment Report (2013) and then the Basis of Design Report for the Lagunitas Creek Salmonid Winter Habitat Enhancement Project (2013) provided 100% construction designs and specifications for winter habitat enhancement work at nine specific sites. Sediment reduction work was identified in the Lagunitas Creek Watershed Sediment Source Site Assessment (2013) which specifies treatment recommendations and sediment savings for each identified road erosion site including 60 sites along the Cross Marin Trail. An initial phase of the winter habitat enhancement work (at four sites) has been awarded 2014 California Department of Fish and Wildlife Fisheries Restoration Grant Program funding. An initial phase of the sediment reduction work (at three major sites) is currently being implemented funded under the Bay Area s Proposition 84 Round 2 Implementation Grant. The project proposed here is a second phase of winter habitat enhancement and sediment reduction work to be conducted in proximity to the phase one efforts in and at tributaries to Lagunitas Creek. Winter Habitat Enhancement Survival of coho and steelhead in the creek can be improved by enhancing rearing and high flow refuge areas. This implementation project will install Large Woody Debris structures as engineered log jams to reconnect the floodplain with the main channel to be used by over wintering juveniles and spawning adults. This will allow for higher densities and greater carrying capacity of salmonids through the winter. Reconnecting the floodplain will also allow for fine sediments in the flood waters to settle out and be stored in the floodplain to improve water quality. This project will implement the construction of up to four winter habitat enhancement features which were previously identified and designed in the winter habitat assessment. The assessment produced 100% engineered design drawings specifications and construction cost estimates for the specific sites where habitat enhancement will be implemented. The 100% design drawings will be used for environmental review and permitting contractor bidding and site construction. Sediment Reduction Sedimentation particularly by fine sediments has been identified as being detrimental to the habitat of Lagunitas Creek for coho and steelhead. The State Water Quality Control Board has identified Lagunitas Creek as being impaired by sediment and has adopted a sediment TMDL for Lagunitas Creek. This project will implement actions aimed at reducing fine sediments from entering the creek leading to enhanced water quality and streambed conditions of Lagunitas Creek. In addition project work will strengthen the route along which the Marin Municipal Water District s Nicasio Transmission Pipeline a major public water supply transmission line runs. Project work will be conducted collaboratively on MMWD State Park and National Park Service (NPS) lands as well as some private properties within the watershed in collaboration with the Marin RCD. The above referenced Lagunitas Creek Watershed Sediment Source Site Assessment has identified approximately 300 sediment source sites on unpaved roads in the watershed downstream of reservoirs. This includes 60 sites along the Cross-Marin Trail which is the route of MMWD s Nicasio Transmission Pipeline and an important recreational trail. This IRWMP project will implement improvements to the Cross Marin Trail to strengthen the transmission line and stabilize this recreational trail. The work will address both chronic and catastrophic sources of sediment. Also gravel management actions as identified from an MMWD-led in stream gravel assessment will be implemented in order to increase the gravel and cobble fraction of the streambed. This project work is included in the Lagunitas Creek Stewardship Plan. Also winter habitat enhancement and sediment reduction in Lagunitas Creek have been identified as important recovery actions in the State's Recovery Strategy for California Coho Salmon as well as the federal Recovery Plan for Central California Coastal Coho Salmon. In addition fine sediment reduction is a focus of the State's Lagunitas Creek Sediment TMDL. Project Scalability The scope of this project and the grant request amount are scalable. Total estimated costs to implement the winter habitat enhancement and sediment reduction work identified for this reach of Lagunitas Creek is $5 million. Initial phases of work already funded will accomplish $1.5 million in work leaving $3.5 million unfunded. This proposal requests $1.5 million and will accomplish $2 million in work. By adding or reducing the number of project sites implemented the proposed grant request and cost share can be scaled upwards to $3.5 million or downwards to $1.0 million. Disadvantaged Community: This project does not provide benefits specifically for a DAC; the project will benefit the Lagunitas Creek watershed in Marin County California and the Bay Area region in general. DAC This project will not provide specific benefits directly for a disadvantaged community. The project will benefit the region and Lagunitas Creek in general rather than a specific DAC. ","Project Need: Regional priorities addressed by this project include regional water supply reliability/long-term sustainability; health of the Bay and creeks; sediment management; and fisheries restoration for coho salmon and steelhead recovery. Lagunitas Creek supports the largest and most stable population of endangered coho salmon in Central California; it also supports a robust population of threatened steelhead trout. The Lagunitas Limiting Factors Analysis (Stillwater Sciences 2008) identified winter habitat as the limiting factor for both coho salmon and steelhead populations in the Lagunitas Creek watershed. Fall juvenile and spring smolt survey data indicate dramatic declines in the numbers of juvenile coho during the winter months. It is hypothesized that winter habitat in Lagunitas Creek is limited during base flow to bank-full periods. Sedimentation particularly by fine sediments has been identified as being detrimental to the habitat of Lagunitas Creek for coho and steelhead. Roads are a major source of both chronic and catastrophic sediment loading to fish-bearing streams. MMWD has major water supply transmission pipelines running under some of the roads in the Lagunitas watershed. The Sediment Site Source Assessments estimates that up to 56400 cu.yds of sediment (over 20000 cu.yds. on the Cross Marin Trail alone) could be prevented from entering Lagunitas Creek and its tributaries by implementing the recommended sediment reduction work. The State Water Resources Control Board has identified Lagunitas Creek as being impaired by sediment and has adopted the Lagunitas Creek Sediment TMDL which calls for implementing sediment reduction from roads and also to reconnect the mainstem of Lagunitas Creek to its floodplain and install large wood to sort and store fine sediment. This project will implement actions aimed at increasing winter habitat and reducing fine sediments from entering the creek leading to enhanced habitat water quality and streambed conditions of Lagunitas Creek. In addition some of the project work will secure the route along the Marin Municipal Water District s (MMWD s) Nicasio Transmission Pipeline a major public water supply transmission line. The federal Recovery Plan for Evolutionarily Significant Unit of Central California Coast Coho Salmon Final Plan (National Marine Fisheries Service  2012) includes this task for coho recovery:  Conduct rehabilitation activities that restore channels floodplains and meadows to extend the duration of the summer flow and provide refuge from high winter flows (Evaluate the Tocaloma reach of the lower Lagunitas mainstem) . This project is within the Tocaloma reach of lower Lagunitas Creek. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Coho salmon in Central California are on the brink of extinction; not implementing this project will not provide the habitat enhancement and sediment reduction needed to help recover the population not only for Lagunitas Creek but for all of Central California. A failure of culverts at Lagunitas Creek tributary crossings of the earth and road conveying the District's water supply transmission pipeline could have a significant impact on water supply to large portions of Marin County. Regional priorities addressed by this project include regional water supply reliability/long-term sustainability; health of the Bay and creeks; sediment management; and fisheries restoration for coho salmon and steelhead recovery. (Additional narrative regarding specific manner in which this project addresses regional priorities can easily be provided upon request.) ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) The project work will strengthen the route along which the Marin Municipal Water District s (MMWD s) Nicasio Transmission Pipeline a major public water supply transmission line runs by strengthening the earth supporting the pipeline at culvert crossings and other sediment reduction sites. This will provide water supply reliability for MMWD's customers in Marin County. ii. Water Quality The project will support the State's Sediment TMDL for Lagunitas Creek by reducing fine sediment loading to streams supporting endangered coho salmon and threatened steelhead. Sediment reduction will enhance habitat for the benefit of coho and steelhead by resulting in increased pool habitat and improved sediment quality at critical spawning riffle habitats. Sediment loading reductions will also reduce turbidity and improve water quality conditions for all aquatic life in Lagunitas Creek. The project will also directly support the Sediment TMDL by installing large wood and reconnecting the mainstem channel to its floodplain to sort and store fine sediment. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management The project will implement road drainage improvements by sizing them for the 100-year storm thereby reducing turbidity and other adverse impacts from stormwater flows from these roads. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) This project provides Resource Stewardship benefits as it will result in habitat protection and restoration in several aspects: 1) it will implement the construction of up to four winter habitat enhancement features for the benefit of endangered coho salmon and threatened steelhead. 2) The project will reduce fine sediment loading to streams supporting endangered coho salmon and threatened steelhead. 3) The project will also enhance floodplain sediment storage addressing the primary goals and objectives identified in the State s Lagunitas Creek Sediment TMDL. Sediment reduction will enhance habitat for the benefit of coho and steelhead by resulting in increased pool habitat and improved sediment quality at critical spawning riffle habitats. Sediment loading reductions will also reduce turbidity and improve water quality conditions for all aquatic life in Lagunitas Creek and in some cases remove barriers to fish passage. The project will have a public recreation benefit for hikers bicyclists and equestrians who use the recreational roads in the watershed. The road drainage improvements will also improve the road surfaces to more stable road beds and provide recreation reliability with the roads being open and passable. Benefit/Cost Ratio As noted above Phase I of the sediment reduction work along the Cross Marin Trail is currently underway and was included in the Bay Area s Proposition 84 Round 2 IRWM Implementation Grant. A rigorous benefit/cost analysis was conducted during the proposal development process which resulted in establishing a benefit/cost ratio of 3.09 for this project. As the sediment reduction work included with this current concept proposal is virtually identical in nature (just at different sites located along the stream reach) to the Phase I work it is reasonable to assume the sediment reduction work proposed here would also achieve a 3.09 benefit/cost ratio. Phase I of the winter habitat enhancement work proposed here is receiving funding from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife s Fishery Restoration Grant Program. A detailed benefit/cost analysis has not been conducted or required for the winter habitat enhancement aspect of this proposed project however the benefits are similar and the costs are similar enough to the sediment reduction work costs and benefits that we can assume a high benefit/cost ratio for this proposed project likely close to the 3.09 benefit/cost ratio already determined as described above. Integration This project presents a high degree of up-front integration as it addresses priorities associated with several Functional Areas including Water Supply/Water Quality Stormwater/Flood Control and Watershed/Habitat. As described above the project will contribute measurably to water supply reliability water quality improvement watershed habitat restoration endangered species protection as well as providing stormwater and recreation benefits.

","Project Type Description: Elements of the Drought Preparedness and Water Conservation Plan ( Plan ) support the following project types: Drinking water supply: The Plan includes multiple elements which would reduce demands on existing drinking water sources and diversify future drinking water supplies. Water reuse/recycling: The Plan includes a Recycled Water Enhancements and Improvement sub-project which would increase recycled water use and decrease potable water demands. Groundwater Benefits: The Plan includes a sub-project to develop a new groundwater source for the District. Habitat Restoration: The Plan includes potential development of new groundwater and desalination water supply sources which could reduce demands on surface water sources thereby increasing water available for stream habitat. ","Detailed description: The North Coast County Water District (\"District\") is proposing a project concept referred to as a  Drought Preparedness and Water Conservation Plan  and consists of multiple sub-projects each being actively pursued by the District to meet and reduce water demand during periods of drought and to provide operational flexibility and increased reliability for the District. The District s Plan consists of four sub-projects (A through D) each discussed below: A. Pipeline Replacement Program In 2013 the District initiated a study to develop a 20-Year Water Master Plan and Capital Improvement Program ( CIP ). A pipeline replacement program was identified and included as a high-priority CIP project and the District s study identified specific pipelines which present the greatest risk for leaks and failures. The District has many pipelines in its system which are older asbestos-cement ( AC ) pipes and which are prone to leaks. The goal of this sub-project is to replace the oldest and most critical pipelines in the water system. B. Supplemental Groundwater Supply This sub-project involves siting permitting engineering and construction-related activities associated with obtaining supplemental groundwater supplies in the District s service area. This includes possible construction of exploration well(s) and a new groundwater production well(s). The District is evaluating possible sites for construction of a new groundwater well on parcels owned by the District. The funding requested for this sub-project will be utilized for the cost to construct a groundwater exploration well and a production well including engineering permitting and construction costs. C. Regional Desalination Feasibility Study Serving a coastal community the District is investigating the feasibility of working with neighboring communities including Daly City San Bruno Montara Water District and Half Moon Bay for example to explore the costs and benefits of constructing a regional desalination treatment plant. This sub-project involves the cost to coordinate a regional study led by the District which would investigate potential sites for a desalination plant and expected costs and yields. D. Recycled Water Enhancements and Improvements The District has a partnership with the City of Pacifica to utilize recycled water from Pacifica s Calera Creek Recycling Plant & Collection System. The District receives recycled water from the plant and has constructed a recycled water pipeline and storage tank to supply recycled water to some District customers. The District plans to expand recycled water use in its southern service area. Recently the District made improvements to the Calera Creek plant including adding pumps and valves. The next phase of recycled water expansion is to convert more potable customers to recycled water. The District is considering the potential for new recycled water service for the following locations:   Terra Nova High School   Ortega Elementary School   Alma Heights School   Oddstad Soccer Fields An additional component of the District s Recycled Water Enhancement and Improvements sub-project is collaboration with the SFPUC to increase recycled water use for the Sharp Park Golf Course. Scalability: Projects A and D are highly scalable pending funding availability. These projects can be done in phases to address the highest priority pipelines/customers in earlier phases. ","Project Need: The District serves a population of approximately 39000 people. The District purchases its water supply from the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission ( SFPUC ) which provides water from its Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and local Bay Area watersheds in the Sunol area and on the San Francisco Peninsula. Regional Need: Reduced dependence on SFPUC water supply If the District increases conservation and develops its own local water sources (groundwater and/or desalination) it could be less dependent on the water supply from the SFPUC system and increase supply reliability through diversification. Regional Need: Improved reliability and emergency supply for District and neighbors In addition the District has emergency interties with three neighboring water districts: City of Daly City the City of San Bruno and Westborough Water District which also purchase water from the SFPUC system. An increase in water supply reliability for the District and increased water conservation potential could also serve to improve reliability for these neighboring districts during emergencies. Operational/Reliability Needs : The District s water supply allocation from the SFPUC is delivered through a single pipeline that is approximately 4.2 miles in length and is aligned along the San Andreas Fault. Because of this the District s source of supply and that pipeline are highly vulnerable to seismic activity. The District s Plan includes elements that would increase water supply reliability and diversify supply sources so as to lessen its vulnerability to an outage of the SFPUC supply. Water Supply Needs : In addition to its supply from the SFPUC the District holds surface water rights to San Pedro Creek located within its service area. However the San Pedro Creek surface water rights are limited and represent only 8% of its total water supply allocation from the SFPUC. The District has a need to diversify its water supply sources for improved flexibility and adaptability during drought conditions and climate change. Conservation/Water Demand Needs : Current drought conditions and the potential for persistent future drought conditions make the need for conservation critical. The District s Plan has sub-projects which would increase conservation by reducing leaks and by reducing demands. The pipeline replacement project would reduce leaks in older pipes. The recycled water project would replace potable consumption with recycled consumption thereby reducing potable demands. Potential new water sources (groundwater desalination) would reduce demands on surface water sources of supply. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Without implementation of these projects the District will be primarily reliant upon the SFPUC for its entire water supply. The District receives this water through a pipeline aligned along the San Andreas Fault making this supply vulnerable to seismic activity. Though the District has interties with neighboring water districts these districts are also primarily dependent upon the SFPUC for their water supply. Having a diversified local supply of water would improve emergency scenarios. If future drought conditions persist and worsen without this Plan the District would have few alternatives for water supply should the SFPUC s supplies be limited. This Plan includes potential development of groundwater and desalination; without these options the District will be primarily dependent on the SFPUC. Without this plan opportunities to create significant increases in conservation may be limited. Recently the District has implemented public education programs rebate programs and mandatory restrictions to promote conservation. Such programs will continue in the future. However the conservation opportunities presented in this Plan (replaced pipelines increased recycled water usage) represent more significant strategies for improving conservation. ","Project Benefits: The District s Plan will achieve multiple benefits. Plan sub-projects support the management strategies in both the  Water Supply and Water Quality  and  Wastewater and Recycled Water  functional areas identified in the BAIRWMP. Water Supply Benefits: The Plan s benefits include increased water conservation diversification of water supply sources improved emergency water supply reliability reduced reliance on surface water and reduced reliance on imported water. The sub-projects of the Plan target a reduction in potable water consumption through conservation of 10-15 million gallons per year which could potentially be realized with pipeline replacements (sub-project A) and increased recycled water usage (sub-project D). Additional conservation of surface water resources on the order of 100 million gallons per year could potentially be realized through in-lieu use of supplemental groundwater supplies (sub-project B) and desalination (sub-project C). Preliminary estimates for the total potential water savings represent about 10% of the District s average annual water demand. Resource Stewardship Benefits: Development of alternative water supply sources (groundwater desalination) would reduce demands on surface water resources potentially benefitting stream habitat quality. Other: These projects are also collectively anticipated to reduce District staff time and resources used to repair pipelines; reduce demand on the SFPUC water supplies; and reduce costs to the District to purchase water from the SFPUC. Benefit/Cost Ratio: The District estimates a benefit/cost ratio of 1.1 or better is achievable over the life of the sub-projects. A more rigorous benefit/cost analysis may be provided should the District be invited to move forward in the Bay Area IRWMP process.

","Project Type Description: Water Reuse/Recycling: Project will assess reuse of stormwater for irrigation; Stormwater Improvements: on-site management of stormwater run-off with green infrastructure improvements; Groundwater Benefits: treated stormwater which ultimately recharges groundwater; Infiltration: the project area has soil types conducive for stormwater infiltration (>0.5 in/hr); Habitat Protection and Restoration: restoration of historic creek and landscaping will include native plants which provides potential habitat for local species; Flood Protection: green infrastructure elements are designed to reduce surface flows and provide additional protection against flooding; Related to a Disadvantaged Community: project is placed in a disadvantaged community (Portola Valley Neighborhood). ","Detailed description: The Upper Yosemite Creek Daylighting project will daylight the headwaters of the historic Yosemite Creek to manage stormwater runoff from 110 acres of McLaren Park. This San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) project will feature storage and infiltration facilities as well as a creek channel to convey stormwater and alleviate localized flooding issues. This is the first creek daylighting project initiated by the City and it has the added benefit of reintroducing natural habitat and providing opportunities for community learning and beautification. Currently stormwater from the area drains into Yosemite Marsh and McNab Lake. When the water levels in Yosemite Marsh and McNab Lake reach the outlet elevations water spills into the combined sewer system. San Francisco s combined sewer system collects transports and treats both wastewater and stormwater. During severe wet weather events the combined sewer system can become overwhelmed sometimes causing combined sewer discharges (CSD) at permitted CSD outfalls in the Pacific Ocean and the San Francisco Bay. The Yosemite Creek Daylighting project is one of eight Early Implementation Projects (EIPs) that the SFPUC is planning to construct as part of its Sewer System Improvement Program (SSIP). The common goal of the EIPs is to demonstrate the use of performance-based green infrastructure technologies to remove stormwater from the combined sewer system and attenuate peak flows. However the Upper Yosemite Creek Daylighting Project is unique in that it is the only EIP featuring creek daylighting. The information and expertise gained will be used to support the future of green infrastructure within the City of San Francisco. The proposed scope for the Yosemite Creek Daylighting project includes a creek channel that will flow along the northern edge of McLaren Park from Yosemite Marsh the southern edge of the soccer field and the northern eastern and southern edges of the softball fields. Overflow structures will be modified at Yosemite Marsh and McNab Lake to divert excess water to the new creek channel. To control flow velocity and increase habitat space bioretention facilities will be incorporated at various points along the creek. Subsurface stormwater storage tanks will be installed at the northwestern edge of the softball fields. These subsurface tanks will be used to store stormwater and manage flow volumes heading for the combined sewer system. In addition opportunities to reuse captured stormwater to irrigate the soccer field or the creek channel are being investigated. The project team has been working closely with the SF Recreation and Parks Department to integrate the creek into existing park uses. The project area is surrounded by a socio-economically disadvantaged community called Portola Valley. During the planning phase of this project public workshops and multiple small community group meetings were held to solicit public input and feedback. Two online surveys were provided for additional public feedback on the project. Public input has been used to refine the scope and aesthetic of the project. The project will feature an outdoor classroom to provide opportunities to learn about San Francisco's historic creeks and the benefits of natural systems to treat and manage stormwater. The proposed scope incorporates design features to create habitat and biodiversity increase education and public involvement regarding water resource management promote neighborhood greening and enhance interagency project synergies. Additional agencies that the Project Team worked with to refine and gain project approvals are the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency San Francisco Fire Department and the San Francisco Department of Public Works. ","Project Need: Impervious surfaces such as buildings streets and parking lots cover most of San Francisco preventing rainfall infiltration. Over time creeks were buried and connected to the combined sewers and wetlands were infilled. Instead of percolating into soils runoff now travels over impervious surfaces mobilizes pollutants and washes them into the sewer system or receiving water bodies. During heavy rain events stormwater runoff can contribute to localized flooding combined sewer discharges and the degradation of surface water quality. Moreover the decrease in infiltration resulting from paved surfaces contributes to groundwater depletion. While water quality protection is the fundamental driver behind stormwater management well-designed stormwater controls (i.e. green infrastructure) offer many direct and ancillary benefits. Some of the direct benefits include reducing and delaying the volumes and peak flows of stormwater reaching the sewer system. Volume reduction and peak flow desynchronization can help reduce the number of stormwater overflows decrease flooding and protect water quality. Green infrastructure projects have the potential to improve the capacity and efficiency of San Francisco's treatment facilities. Some of the ancillary benefits include enhancement of community spaces street beautification and improved conditions for bicyclists and pedestrians. Green infrastructure also protects and creates more livable habitat for native wildlife and provides an opportunity to integrate stormwater management into the redevelopment of historic sites. Yosemite Creek Daylighting is one of eight Early Implementation Projects that will be placed throughout San Francisco to provide the basis for performance maintenance and design standards for future city-wide green infrastructure initiatives. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: These early implementation projects are critical to gain public support for the SSIP Green Infrastructure Program inform the cost/benefit as utility assets and meet the goals for the City and County of San Francisco to revitalize public streets create green jobs and improve wildlife habitat. ","Project Benefits: Previous studies conducted by the SFPUC identified needs for flood and stormwater management in the Yosemite watershed. This project will decrease localized flooding and increase groundwater infiltration by capturing stormwater runoff and directing it to a new unlined creek channel bioretention facilities and subsurface storage tanks. In addition to watershed needs the project considered synergy opportunities and social and environmental factors. Proposed enhancements to McLaren Park include improved drainage of athletic fields and construction of a new pedestrian path that would provide safer access the park. The project will feature an outdoor classroom to provide opportunities to learn about San Francisco's historic creeks and the benefits of treating and managing stormwater with natural systems. The headwater reach of the historic Yosemite creek will be restored and bioretention facilities will create potential habitat using native plant species. Subsurface storage tanks will be installed to retain excess stormwater and potential reuse for irrigation of McLaren Park athletic fields or the creek channel will be investigated. The green infrastructure technologies included in the current scope of the preferred project alternative can manage stormwater from approximately 110 acres of McLaren Park. The creek channel and inline bioretention areas are estimated to remove approximately 1 million gallons of stormwater per year from the combined sewer system (in a typical rainfall year). The underground storage facility is estimated to remove approximately 6.5 million gallons of stormwater per year. The reduction in peak flow resulting from a  Level of Service  storm (1.3 inches in three hours) is estimated to be approximately 1.2 million gallons per event. These are initial estimates based on unit green infrastructure performance metrics developed using numerous citywide Sewer System Master Plan and SSIP modeling analyses conducted using the City and County of San Francisco Hydrologic and Hydraulic model10. These values will be refined through project-specific modeling during conceptual engineering and design. Based on this preliminary estimate of annual stormwater volume removed and the estimated annualized life cycle cost the costs of the Yosemite Creek Daylighting Project is approximately $0.114 per gallon of stormwater removed. As one of SFPUC s Early Implementation Projects information obtained from this project will be used to develop plans for future installations of green infrastructure.

"6 ","San Bruno Groundwater Development Project ","This Project includes the development and use of groundwater as a new source of supply for the City of San Bruno through the design and construction of a new municipal groundwater supply well and treatment system. It is anticipated that this project could deliver approximately 800 acre feet per year (AFY) of additional high-quality water supply to the City and allow the City to meet the terms of the Westside Basin Groundwater Storage and Recovery Project (GSR) Agreement which provides drought benefits to the entire West Bay sub-region. ","('West Bay';) | San Mateo ","37.63202 |-122.42278 ","2/1/2013 ","12/31/2016 ","The project will be in the City of San Bruno which is located in Northern San Mateo County in the  West Bay  sub-region as identified in the Bay Area IRWMP. The new municipal groundwater well and treatment system will be located on a City-owned parcel at the corner of Mariner Drive and Commodore Drive. The City overlies DWR Basin (2-35) the Westside Groundwater Basin. ","Project Type Description: DRINKING WATER SUPPLY: This project will add approximately 800 AFY of potable water to the City's water supply portfolio. This will increase and diversify the supply available to the City including during droughts or other supply interruptions. This Project is also critical to the successful operation of the Westside Basin GSR Project which is a critical drought relief project for the region. WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT: The treatment system that will be developed to treat the produced groundwater will ensure that the groundwater that enters the City's water distribution system meets all primary and secondary MCLs. GROUNDWATER BENEFITS: The City currently manages its surface and groundwater sources conjunctively both locally and regionally as part of the South Westside Basin Groundwater Management Plan (GWMP) and the Westside Basin GSR Project. Development of this Project will assist the City to continue to do that in a cost-effective manner. ","Detailed description: Objective This Project will develop local groundwater resources for conjunctive use to increase public safety diversify the City s supply portfolio provide drought relief and increase supply reliability to the City and the region. The City has one of the lowest residential per capita water uses in the State (48 R-GPCD) which makes drought cutbacks difficult to achieve. This Project will increase the City s water supply by as much as 800 AFY allow the City to contribute to the Westside Basin GSR Project and make the City and region more resilient to drought cutbacks. Description This Project includes the design and construction of a new municipal groundwater supply well and treatment system. This Project will deliver 800 AFY of treated water to the City. Implementation of this Project will diversify the City s water portfolio improve drinking water supply reliability provide drought relief and better allow the City to meet the health and safety needs of its water-efficient residents now and in the future as well as benefit the region as part of its participation in the Westside Basin GSR Project. Readiness to Proceed The City initiated work on this Project in 2013. To date the City has retained technical consulting assistance for the design and construction of the well and treatment system acquired land drilled a pilot hole to log stratigraphy constructed a monitoring well conducted water quality sampling and completed a CEQA analysis. The City is planning to issue bid documents for the well in Spring 2015 and will begin construction by Fall 2015. Following construction and testing of the well the City will initiate design and construction of the treatment system with Project completion anticipated in December 2016. Function/Physical Benefit The Project will produce 800 AFY of high-quality water for potable use. The Project will function as a lower cost supplemental source of supply to the City which will aid the City to balance its use of surface water during normal and drought years supply an additional source of water into the City s distribution system to meet demands in three different pressure zones increase the City s resilience to supply disruption and climate change impacts and ensure that the demands of the City s customers can be reliably met. This Project will also increase the region s drought reliability through the City s participation in the Westside Basin GSR Project. Coordination/Collaboration The City is committed to continuing to work with stakeholders in the Westside Basin and the region to effectively manage the basin including the development and implementation of management and monitoring programs in conformance with current State laws and local agreements including those for the implementation of the 2012 South Westside Basin GWMP the Westside Basin GSR Project and future actions to be taken in response to the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. Specifically the entities that the City has been coordinating with include: the Bay Area Water Supply and Conservation Agency (BAWSCA); San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC); Daly City; South San Francisco; and other stakeholders. ","Project Need: LOCAL DROUGHT RELIEF AND WATER SUPPLY NEED: Currently the City s customers use approximately 48 R-GPCD which means that during a significant drought and cutbacks to its surface water supply they have limited ability to reduce their consumption. The construction of this well will provide the City with a supplemental source of supply which will create a buffer for the City during droughts such as the one that we are currently experiencing. Further since the City will have an alternative supply that it can rely on during normal and drought years this Project will reduce the City s reliance on surface water which benefits the region and the Delta and increase the City s resilience in the face of climate change. REGIONAL DROUGHT RELIEF NEED: The City is a participant in the Westside Basin GSR Project which is a 7.4 MGD drought-relief project that increases the supply reliability for the entire Hetch-Hetchy system including for all the BAWSCA agencies. The GSR Agreement requires the City to pump 3350 AFY at an average rate of 2.1 GPM during dry years in order to provide drought benefit to the region (i.e. when SFPUC declares a drought the City is required to use groundwater in lieu of taking surface water from the Hetch-Hetchy system which then frees up surface water for other system users). Without this Project the City will not have the capacity to produce sufficient groundwater which will impact the drought reliability of the region. WATER SYSTEM RELIABILITY NEED: As was evidenced during the 2009 explosion of the PG&E; gas pipeline in the City which shut-down water service to a portion of the City and the recent water quality incident on the Hetch-Hetchy system wherein untreated water was delivered to many utilities in the region the City will benefit from a supplemental source of supply that can act as an additional source of supply during an emergency or other supply interruption from the Hetch-Hetchy system. This Project will provide highly-treated water to multiple pressure zones within the City greatly increasing operational flexibility and system redundancy and reliability. WATER QUALITY NEED: Groundwater produced from the Westside Basin tends to have elevated levels of iron and manganese. Therefore in order to deliver groundwater to its customers for potable use the City will have to design construct and operate a treatment system. ECONOMIC NEED: Currently the cost to purchase water from the Hetch-Hetchy system is approximately $1900 per acre-foot. In contrast groundwater from this Project will cost approximately $400 per acre-foot to produce achieving a much more cost-effective water supply solution for the City. Over 20 years this Project will save the City $24000000. Furthermore without this Project and the ability to conjunctively use groundwater locally and as part of the Westside Basin GSR Project the City and the region will suffer significant economic impacts during drought. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Local Water Supply / Drought Relief Impact If this Project is not implemented the City will remain vulnerable to drought which will have significant economic and other impacts. The City will also be vulnerable to supply interruptions or water quality breaches on the Hetch-Hetchy system. Regional Drought Impact Without this Project the City will not have the capacity to produce the amount of groundwater that it is required to do under the Westside Basin GSR Project Agreement which will impact the drought reliability of the region and have a major economic impact. Economic Impact The City will be negatively impacted economically as the cost to purchase water from the Hetch-Hetchy system is significantly more expensive than the cost to produce groundwater (i.e. currently the cost to purchase water from the Hetch-Hetchy system is approximately $1900 per acre-foot while groundwater costs approximately $400 per acre-foot to produce). Over 20 years this Project will save the City $24000000. Further to the extent that the Westside Basin GSR Project is not able to effectively function due to the City s lack of production capacity there will be significant economic impacts to the region. ","Project Benefits: By adding an additional local and drought-proof supply source this Project immediately achieves the following benefits locally (and by extension to the region) that are consistent with State and regional priorities: Immediate Drought Preparedness This Project increases the City s water supply portfolio by 800 AFY to include a more drought-proof groundwater source that will benefit the City s customers that currently use 48 R-GPCD. Further this Project ensures that the City can meet the terms of its Westside Basin GSR Agreement which requires the City to pump 3350 AFY at an average rate of 2.1 GPM during dry years in order to provide drought benefit to the region (i.e. when SFPUC declares a drought the City is required to groundwater in lieu of taking surface water from the Hetch-Hetchy system which then frees up surface water for other users of the Hetch-hetchy system). Increases local water supply reliability and the delivery of safe drinking water This Project adds 800 AFY of treated groundwater to the City s available supplies. Groundwater Management Through the implementation of the South Westside Basin GWMP and the Westside Basin GSR Project the City continues to work with other basin users to manage the Westside Basin and to provide drought benefits locally and to the region. Improvement of Water Quality By adding a groundwater treatment system the City will be able to tap into an underutilized resource and distribute high-quality water to its customers. Drinking water treatment and distribution By adding wellhead treatment the City will have access to 800 AFY of treated groundwater that meets all MCLs that can be served within three pressure zones within the City.

Restoration site selection will be guided by Point Blue s Future Tidal Marshes Tool and the California Avian Data Center to ensure both water quality protection and resilience to climate change. In-classroom education and participation in on-the-ground restoration will occur with schools in Alameda Contra Costa Marin Napa San Francisco San Mateo Solano and Sonoma counties. See the project map included in the Background Documents for the location of watersheds where restoration projects occur and the communities that participate. Since this project has various site locations Point Blue s headquarters in Petaluma CA will be used as the Latitude/Longitude location. ","Project Type Description: Our restoration projects improve water quality by reducing bank-side erosion and filtering storm water runoff into streams; restore and protect habitat by planting native plants along bare or degraded stream banks and wetland edges; provide flood protection by reducing invasive plant populations along stream banks; and educate and empower area students and community members to be active stewards of their land. ","Detailed description: For the past 23 years Point Blue s STRAW Program has provided award-winning watershed science education including professional-quality habitat restoration for thousands of Bay Area students and teachers. STRAW addresses the social component of stewardship through direct community involvement with practices that build resilient healthy watersheds. We propose to implement multiple priority native planting and invasive plant removal projects in both riparian and wetland-upland transition zone habitat types around the San Pablo Bay and San Francisco Bay watersheds with schools and other community members. We provide interactive habitat-specific education to all participants and extensive professional development to participating teachers. These educational practices enable STRAW to provide meaningful opportunities for many Bay Area school communities to engage in projects that actively help their communities adapt to a changing climate. Substantial monitoring is incorporated into our project to confirm the effectiveness of our practices for educational value vegetation establishment success and wildlife benefit. STRAW will engage 9933 project participants in restoring 25.08 hectares of riparian and wetland-upland habitat. Eligibility Factors: 1. Point Blue s STRAW Program is currently a component of the 2013 Bay Area IRWM Plan. Further description of how this project addresses the Goals and Objectives of the BAIRWM Plan is described in the  BAIRWMP Goals  section. 2. STRAW is 100% ready to proceed. We have several pending project sites that do not require any environmental documentation or permitting. Planting designs and work plans will be finalized and installed upon award of funds. Implementation will begin during the 2016-2017 winter season. Project work and expenditure of funds will be completed by 2020. 3. We have substantial in-kind volunteer labor match to meet the 25% upfront match requirement. 4. STRAW has clearly defined physical benefits and associated metrics. 5. STRAW currently has a DWR-accepted Benefit/Cost analysis from the previous IRWM funding cycle of $14.22/$1 based on habitat creation and water quality improvement. 6. STRAW is able to pay our equitable share of the consultant costs for the regional application. 7. STRAW is widely supported through regional collaboration with many public and private agencies operating and managing properties around San Pablo Bay and San Francisco Bay. In addition our restoration practices are derived from and have guided the pertinent plans and frameworks for the region. Our dedicated network of teachers and community members around the Bay Area are ready to implement projects. 8. STRAW projects meet multiple objectives and achieve multiple benefits in various IRWM functional categories including Climate Change (Shoreline Sustainability) Health of the Bay and Creeks Sediment Management Invasives Management and Riparian and Fisheries Restoration. 9. STRAW requests $5500000 with a 25% match of $1375000 for a total project cost of $6875000 over five years. The project is scalable by number and size of projects depending on available funds. 10. STRAW has proven to be an impactful and effective community-based habitat restoration and education program throughout the Bay Area. Participating schools and partners come from nine Bay Area counties: Alameda Contra Costa Marin Napa San Francisco San Mateo Santa Clara Solano and Sonoma. ","Project Need: STRAW habitat restoration projects address the regional needs regarding water supply water quality storm water management flood protection and resource stewardship through community implemented habitat restoration. Bay Area streams and wetlands have experienced widespread degradation from development impacts such as polluted storm water runoff loss of habitat erosion and sedimentation problems invasive species increased flood severity and decreased biodiversity. As a result the San Francisco Bay Estuary is one of the most modified estuaries in the United States (Goals Project 1999). Many rural rural streams around the San Francisco Bay Area are ecologically compromised due to a lack of the plant communities that provides a mosaic of mid and upper canopy habitat structures. The canopy these plant communities provide shade riparian areas to keep the water cool which mitigates high summer temperatures. In addition these communities  root structures help decompact the soil increasing water s ability to adequately infiltrate into the water table. This compromised condition reduces a riparian system s ability to keep water temperatures cool and absorb rainfall during the wet season. At a local scale this ultimately reduces water availability for agricultural operations that rely on surface water catchment and wildlife. Our projects are in watersheds with severe water quality needs. Many watersheds are categorized with either a 303D listing or TMDL designation for excess sediment and other pollutants. In addition to sediments storm water runoff also carries herbicides pesticides excess nutrients trash and toxic particulates from roadways into waterways. Established native vegetation on rural creek banks captures and filters sediments and other pollutants from overland flows. Non-native invasive plants often contribute to a reduction in water capacity of urban streams because these species are prone to block or clog flood channels. This relates to the regional priority of Invasive Management. For many of our North Bay watersheds excess sediment is also a primary contributing factor to flooding problems because of the reduction in flood water capacity in channels due to the accrual of sediments in the channel beds. Much of the existing creek and wetland-upland transition zones in the Bay Area are denuded degraded or otherwise low-functioning. Functioning riparian corridors provide many critical services and benefits for both wildlife and human communities including habitat connectivity thermal refugia flood protection and storm water filtration that improves water quality. Riparian and wetland areas with degraded conditions are not providing these essential resources and benefits which relates to the regional priority of Riparian and Fisheries Restoration. Past land management practices of development and removing native vegetation from the land have greatly reduced the landscape s ability to absorb and sequester atmospheric carbon. One of the most heavily impact systems with a high potential for sequestering atmospheric carbon are riparian forests. The reestablishment of woody perennial vegetation will greatly increase these system s ability to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic climate change. Just as we do not expect children to play in baseball games without practicing first we should not expect children to become democratic citizens without also practicing first. Unfortunately there are limited opportunities within the standard school system for students to see how their learning applies and connects to their community and the world. Additionally community members who are disconnected from schools see students as people who could make a difference in the future not now. Meaningful shared work among students teachers and the community happens few and far between further isolating ourselves and weakening our communities. Students are constantly presented with accounts of increasing natural disasters rising temperatures and drought in recent decades (Sobel 2006). With a continual increase in major environmental challenges that have resulted from human impact it is essential for students to become environmentally literate through their preK-12 education to be ready to face challenges now and in the future (Nelson 2013). Not only is it important for students to become environmentally literate for the future of conservation but for reasons within social justice and community empowerment as well. Science acts as a  gate-keeping subject  as mastery within science can lead to more wealth and a higher socioeconomic status (Dimick 2012 p.1009). Science education can thus be a leverage point for students in school (Dimick). Coupling science inquiry with social action projects is a perfect blend of academic empowerment currently and lead to political empowerment in the future (Dimick). Unfortunately science education is not equally provided within all schools. Teachers and students in underserved schools are in need of engaging and meaningful science education opportunities. One such need teachers have is finding support in adopting new standards and curriculum. As the Next Generation Science Standards roll out across the state teachers are searching for resources and opportunities to meet these standards. The standards are process and inquiry-based and many teachers feel overwhelmed by additional requirements and new ways of teaching.

In addition the uncertainties of climate change call for innovative and scientifically sound habitat restoration techniques that ensure projects in Bay Area watersheds will be as resilient as possible. We will design our STRAW planting days with community volunteers using our innovative climate-smart restoration practices for riparian and wetland-upland transition zone habitat projects (Gardali et al. in review). If these projects are not implemented 25.08 hectares of riparian and wetland systems will not:   Adequately filter sediment and will contribute excess levels within the watershed   Adequately filter and clean storm water in urban creek systems   Provide food and shelter resources for resident and transitory wildlife   Protect our communities from flooding   Be more resilient to a changing climate   Aid in the reduction of atmospheric carbon   Provide shade to reduce water evaporation from denuded streams   Increase water infiltration through soil decompaction resulting from the root structures of established vegetation In addition over 9933 community members many of them from underserved areas will not receive the opportunity to learn about the benefits of healthy functioning riparian and wetlands systems and the numerous benefits they provide to their communities. These community members also likely will not play an active role in ensuring their watersheds are resilient to a changing climate. ","Project Benefits: STRAW habitat restoration projects provide the critical physical benefits of increased water supply water quality improvement storm water management increased flood protection and increased resource stewardship through community implemented habitat restoration. All STRAW projects are designed to: 1) control erosion and sedimentation; 2) buffer storm water runoff to help reduce point and non-point source pollution into waterways; 3) improve watershed vegetation health and quality; 4) increase habitat value and connectivity for wildlife; 5) increase resilience of ecosystems regardless of future climate scenarios; 6) maximize the amount of atmospheric carbon sequestered per hectare treated; and 7) increase in local water supply through a decrease in surface water evaporation and an increase in groundwater infiltration and 8) educate and engage local communities in the implementation of critical creek and wetland revegetation projects. Through this project a total of 25.08 hectares of creek and wetland-upland habitat will be improved and 9933 people will learn about the environment and participate in habitat improvement projects. 1) Controlling erosion and sedimentation contributes many benefits to Water Quality and Flood and Stormwater Management. Many of STRAW s active projects are in watersheds with either a 303D listing or TMDL designation for excess sediment and other pollutants. For many of our North Bay watersheds excess sediment is also a primary contributing factor to flooding problems because of the reduction in flood water capacity in channels due to the accrual of sediments in the channel beds. Established native vegetation on rural creek banks captures and filters sediments from overland flows. Potential sediment inputs to creeks are calculated using the universal soil loss equation (USLE). Typical rural watersheds yield 0.3 tons of sediment per hectare. This sediment will filter through our completed restoration projects reducing excess sediment inputs. The STRAW project s impact is quantified by the area of creek bank restored at the time of planting. 2) Buffering storm water runoff increases the Water Quality of our waterways and improves Storm water Management of urban creeks. Planted wetland and riparian vegetation improves the quality of storm water runoff through filtration by established native vegetation. Restoration of 15000 ft. of stream with approximately 0.5 cfs flow will provide the treatment equivalent to a storm water treatment plant designed to treat 1.2 million gallons of runoff per day (Riley et al. 2009). This benefit is quantified by the area of creek bank restored at the time of planting to calculate the number of gallons of runoff filtered. 3) Improving watershed vegetation health and quality increases the benefits of Flood Protection and Resource Stewardship. These projects provide lasting protection through flood prevention design practices that maximize native vegetation establishment while removing/discouraging species prone to block or clog flood channels. Established native vegetation inhibits future proliferation of non-native invasive plants that often contribute to a reduction in water capacity of streams. This flood protection benefit is quantified at the time of removal of invasive plants by measuring the area of creek treated and the volume of invasive vegetative matter removed. This resource stewardship benefit is measured by reaching 70% survival of installed native plants each year for three years after installation. 4) Increasing habitat value and connectivity for wildlife provides benefits to Resource Stewardship by installing native plants in denuded degraded or otherwise low-functioning creek and wetland-upland transition areas. This benefit is quantified by measuring area of creek or wetland planted calculating change in native woody plant diversity of restored creeks measuring wildlife response in riparian song bird populations over time and annual photo-monitoring for three years after installation. 5) Increasing resilience of ecosystems regardless of future climate scenarios benefits Resource Stewardship by utilizing  climate-smart  planting designs to ensure that these projects have diverse planting palettes making them as robust and resilient as possible. This benefit is measured at time of plant installation by calculating increase in native woody plant diversity. 6) Maximizing the amount of atmospheric carbon sequestered benefits Resource Stewardship by installing native woody vegetation. This benefit is calculated at the time of installation using the number species and area planted to determine the amount carbon sequestered by the plants installed. Planting 25.08 hectares with riparian forest will sequester 90.54 metric tonnes of CO2 per year. 7) Increasing deep-rooted vegetation and canopy cover benefits Water Quantity by substantially reducing surface water evaporation and increasing groundwater infiltration. The benefit will be determined by a 70% increase of canopy cover over the life of the project as well as a 70% survival of installed species. 8) Educating and engaging local communities many of them from underserved areas in the implementation of critical habitat restoration projects benefits Resource Stewardship by providing a concrete means of learning about and affecting positive change in our watersheds and adapting to climate change. Additionally STRAW supports teachers in many ways. In the hefty challenge of integrating and meeting Next Generation Science Standards we work with teachers one-on-one and support them in identifying ways to meet NGSS through STRAW and beyond. Through our work with underserved schools we connect students with science in approachable fun and memorable ways. We not only teach science through our program but we provide students with the chance to see themselves as scientists. This benefit is measured by number of participants and volunteers in our projects and their change in environmental knowledge and attitudes at the time of their participation. This project will engage and educate 9933 participants who will demonstrate a 75% increase in environmental knowledge. ","  "," ","Point Blue Conservation Science ","0","1","0","1","0","0","1","1"
"8 ","North Bay Water Reuse Authority (NBWRA) Sub-Regional Project ","The North Bay Water Reuse Authority (NBWRA) established under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between 10 local agencies undertook cooperative regional planning efforts to develop the North Bay Water Reuse Program (NBWRP). The purpose of the NBWRP is to provide high quality recycled water for agricultural urban and environmental uses and to expand the recycled water system throughout the greater North San Pablo Bay Area. Implementation of the NBWRP includes upgrades of wastewater treatment processes and construction of storage pipelines and pump station facilities to distribute recycled water. The NBWRP will also reduce reliance on local and imported surface water and groundwater supplies and reduce the amount of treated effluent releases to North San Pablo Bay and its tributaries. ","('North Bay';) | Marin County; Sonoma County; Napa County "," ","07/01/2014 ","10/31/2018 ","The NBWRP area encompasses approximately 318 square miles of land within Marin Sonoma and Napa Counties. This region extends some 10 to 15 miles inland of the tidal San Pablo Bay with a total population of over 270000 in the major urban centers of San Rafael Novato Petaluma Sonoma and Napa. A map of the NBWRA study area can be provided if requested. The specific projects included in this application are located in San Rafael (involving Las Gallinas Valley Sanitary District [LGVSD] and Marin Municipal Water District [MMWD] Novato (involving North Marin Water District [NMWD] and Novato Sanitary District [Novato SD]) Petaluma (involving the City of Petaluma) Sonoma Valley (Sonoma Valley County Sanitation District [SVCSD]) and Napa (Napa Sanitation District [Napa SD]). ","Project Type Description: Water Quality Improvement   The project reduces discharges of treated wastewater to North San Pablo Bay and increases tertiary-level wastewater treatment capacity in the North Bay. Water Reuse/Recycling   The project provides 6000   6100 acre-feet per year (AFY) of tertiary treated recycled water to the North Bay for municipal and agricultural irrigation demands in Marin Sonoma and Napa Counties and habitat restoration of Napa-Sonoma Salt Marsh s Ponds 7 and 7A. Groundwater Benefits & Infiltration   The Milliken-Sarco-Tulocay (MST) groundwater basin area east of the City of Napa relies exclusively on groundwater wells for both potable and irrigation water. That aquifer is estimated to be over-drafted by approximately 2000 AFY. The Los Carneros Water District (LCWD) relies on groundwater and surface water for its potable and irrigation needs. This project will deliver up to 1700 AFY of recycled water to these two areas offsetting the same amount of groundwater (in the MST) and groundwater and surface water (in LCWD) thus contributing to groundwater preservation. Habitat Protection and Restoration   The project will provide 200 AFY of freshwater to the Napa-Sonoma Salt Marsh to restore bittern ponds in the Napa-Sonoma Salt Marsh. Flood Protection   A portion of the project s supply may also be utilized to irrigate future horizontal levees in San Rafael that will protect sanitary district facilities including the recycled water plant from flooding and sea level rise. ","Detailed description: The NBWRA Sub-Regional Project will provide 6000-6100 AFY of recycled water for municipal environmental and agricultural uses. The project includes 7.3 miles of distribution pipelines rehabilitation of a 0.5-million gallon storage tank 7.85 mgd of additional tertiary treatment capacity relining 4300 feet of pipe to allow for increased supply and a significant upgrade to an existing pump station to enable service to two distinct distribution zones. The project offsets the use of potable water in Marin Sonoma and Napa Counties (Russian River water and groundwater) offsets surface water and groundwater used in Sonoma and Napa Counties to support landscape and agricultural irrigation and also provides water for restoration of the Napa-Sonoma Salt Marsh. The Project components for grant funding consideration are part of the larger regional NBWRP included in the Bay Area IRWMP: http://bairwmp.org/projects/north-bay-water-reuse-program. The specific components within this application include: LGVSD Recycled Water Supply Resiliency Project: LGVSD will expand its Recycled Water Facility to supply MMWD's existing recycled water system. The project increases the tertiary capacity at LGVSD by 4 mgd to a total of 5.4 mgd. This project would allow MMWD to distribute more recycled water to its existing irrigation customers (currently using potable water 500-600 AFY) and increase the reliability of those supplies because of fewer operational and water quality issues from the new expanded plant. Novato Recycled Water Central Service Area Expansion The project will increase the tertiary capacity of Novato SD's Davidson Street Water Recycling Facility from 0.85 to 1.70 mgd. This includes the installation of a third sand filter module and expansion of NMWD's recycled water facilities to serve additional schools parks homeowners  associations and a golf course by extending approximately 5.7 miles of 8-18  pipelines and rehabilitation of an out-of-service 500000-gallon water tank. This project will expand recycled water delivery by 300 AFY and provide 200 AFY of potable water offset. Expansion of Petaluma Recycled Water System: The project will increase the tertiary capacity of Petaluma s Ellis Creek Water Recycling Facility from 4.8 to 7.8 mgd providing 3300 AFY for expanding urban and agricultural irrigation. This includes the installation of a second sand filter module and addition of a third channel of ultraviolet lights for disinfection. The project includes expansion of the urban recycled water distribution to serve schools parks and greenbelts by extending a 16  pipeline 1.6 miles in northeastern Petaluma. This project will provide an additional 51 AFY of potable water offset. Sonoma Valley Recycled Water Supply and Reliability Project: SVCSD will reline a 24  reinforced concrete pipeline due to operational issues that are limiting the amount of recycled water that can be beneficially used. The new cured-in-place pipe will have an operating pressure of 100 pounds per square inch (psi) and will be able to withstand spikes of 300 psi. With the relining SVCSD will provide an additional 200 AFY a more reliable recycled water supply to be beneficially used for agricultural uses and habitat restoration.Napa SD Recycled Water Pump Station North/South Split: Napa SD has worked with Napa County and LCWD to extend recycled water service into the MST area to provide up to 2137 AFY for landscaping and irrigation purposes and across the Napa River to provide up to 1800 AFY for landscaping and irrigation purposes. The North/South Split is a necessary upgrade to accommodate the increased distribution of recycled water (up to 1700 AFY) to manage the necessary water pressures and to protect the new distribution lines from hydraulic transients. The project does not provide benefits to a DAC. ","Project Need: The North San Pablo Bay region of Napa Sonoma and Marin Counties faces serious long-term challenges in providing reliable water supplies. The area is not served by federal water projects surface and groundwater sources are limited and some local groundwater basins are over pumped. Urban agricultural and environmental demands exacerbated by ongoing drought exceed the region s ability to provide a reliable sustainable and economical water supply. A clean dependable water supply is also needed to continue the restoration of vital tidal wetlands at the base of the San Pablo Bay watershed that serve in a vital ecological role as nurseries for fisheries and wintering areas for migratory water fowl. The effects of climate change are further stressing the area s water supplies with reduced diversions from the Russian River unpredictable rainfall and fluctuating temperatures. Agricultural land use is expected to remain relatively constant over a 20-year planning period and all three County governments in the study area have explicit policies in place to protect agricultural lands. The region s wastewater treatment agencies have long faced strict limits on the timing and quality of the treated effluent they can send to San Pablo Bay. By treating wastewater to the strict levels required for reuse these agencies can recycle the water in productive ways that augment local water supply and help protect limited potable water resources. Drought conditions have increased recycled water demands and the capacity of traditional potable water supply diversions and conveyance from the Russian River and the State Water Project cannot be increased at this time. Increasing long-term concerns such as climate variability and degrading groundwater quality provide additional motivation for addressing future water needs in Marin Sonoma and Napa Counties. The goals for water and resource conservation in these county General Plans and each of the NBWRA member agencies include recycling and water conservation. The North Bay region has no new surface water or groundwater supplies making recycled water an important component in meeting future water demands in the region. The NBWRA Sub-Regional Project will address the following Bay Area IRWMP priority regional needs: Reinforce/Enhance Water Supply Capacity   6000   6100 AFY of new recycled water supply in the North Bay for municipal environmental and agricultural use including potable water offset of existing surface water and groundwater sources that are strained. Regional Water Reliability/Long-term Sustainability   6000   6100 AFY of new drought-resistant recycled water supply in the North Bay for potable water offset and agricultural use. The NBWRA Sub-Regional Project addresses long-term drought preparedness by offsetting potable water demands with recycled water and enhancing the overall regional suite of water supplies for the area's diverse water needs. Health of Bay and Creeks - 5500   5600 AFY of treated wastewater no longer being discharged to San Pablo Bay to reduce nitrogen/nutrient loading; provides 200 AFY of freshwater to restore former salt ponds in the Napa-Sonoma Marsh. Protection of Water Source Areas - contributes to groundwater preservation in Sonoma and Napa Counties by providing over 1700 AFY of new recycled water supply to offset groundwater currently used for both potable and agricultural demands. Climate Change   new recycled water capacity may be used to irrigate future horizontal levees that will protect LGVSD facilities including the recycled water plant from sea level rise and flooding impacts. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Without implementation of the NBWRP the North San Pablo Bay region will continue to face water supply shortages that will affect municipal and industrial customers the agricultural industry and environmental restoration efforts. The area s limited surface water resources will be strained to provide sufficient local and imported supplies and groundwater basins will be overdrafted particularly in times of drought. Highly treated recycled water produced by the NBWRA facilities would not be put to the most beneficial use. Napa SD s North/South Split component is a critical missing element to the distribution of 1700 AF of recycled water to areas that currently draw water from overdrafted groundwater aquifers in Napa and Sonoma Counties. This project will offset these overdrafts. The proposed modifications are required for recycled water deliveries in order to project infrastructure by maintaining minimum pressures in the MST and LCWD distribution systems providing instrumentation and controls necessary to interact with the MST booster pump station to ensure the connecting pipelines and new equipment are not damaged and protecting the LCWD distribution system from hydraulic transients. If Petaluma s tertiary facility is not expanded there will be insufficient tertiary recycled water to meet peak day demands for drought-sensitive agricultural users. Without expansion of the recycled water distribution pipelines several schools and parks will not be able to utilize recycled water and continue to impose a significant demand upon limited potable water resources. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) The NBWRA Sub-Regional Project will provide 6000   6100 AFY of recycled water supply to the North Bay Area (800-900 AFY in Marin County 3500 AFY in Sonoma County and 1700 AFY in Napa County). This recycled water offsets potable water from: 1) the Russian River; and 2) groundwater in Napa County. The project will also take agricultural users off of strained surface water diversions from local creeks and limited groundwater supplies in Sonoma and Napa Counties where overdraft and saline intrusion are issues. The project will reduce peak potable water demands reduce reliance on imported surface water and reduce treated wastewater discharge into San Pablo Bay by 5500   5600 AFY. Recycled water from the project would be delivered starting in March 2016 with project completion by October 2018. Also expansion of the recycled water production capacity would allow the project to serve agricultural users that have played a vital role in the local economy for over 150 years. ii. Water Quality The NBWRP includes improved levels of wastewater treatment and reduced discharges of treated wastewater into North San Pablo Bay. The project will reduce treated wastewater discharge into San Pablo Bay by 5500 - 5600 AFY reducing nitrogen/nutrient loading. LGVSD s expanded use of tertiary treated effluent will assist in meeting its new NPDES permit no discharge requirements. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management The additional recycled water capacity provided by LGVSD s plant expansion may be used to irrigate future horizontal levees that will protect LGVSD facilities including the recycled water plant from flooding impacts and sea level rise. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The project will provide 200 AFY of tertiary recycled water to facilitate restoration of several of the former salt ponds at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife Napa-Sonoma Marsh Wildlife Area. The NBWRA Sub-Regional Project expects to have a benefit-cost ratio similar to other recycled water projects recently undertaken in the North Bay Area. The project can you provide project benefit/cost analysis information for the Prop 84 application. ","  "," ","North Bay Water Reuse Authority (NBWRA)

","Project Type Description: The Program proposes groupings of projects in all four IRWM subregions that integrate three of the four IRWM functional areas (Watershed/Habitat Flood Protection/Stormwater Wastewater/Recycling). The habitat and flood elements of several projects include ties to stormwater improvements and potential re-use of wastewater. ","Detailed description: The Program proposes groupings of projects in all four IRWM subregions that integrate three of the four IRWM functional areas. The Program is highly collaborative involving a diverse partnership of flood protection habitat restoration and wastewater entities. All projects are currently included in the 2014 plan (with two updates) and the partners are prepared to provide an equitable share of the consulting cost of an application. The Program is expected to provide a significant non-state match (at least 25%). Grant management project monitoring and evaluation plans reporting and data management will be performed by SCC in collaboration with SFEI. The Program is scalable with numerous options for optimally configuring projects within each subregion: North Bay   Novato Creek Area and Environs The Novato Creek Phase I Fluvial-Tidal Wetlands Restoration Project and the Bel Marin Keys Wetland Restoration Project meet complementary goals of flood management adaptation to sea level rise and habitat restoration on lower Novato Creek in Marin County. Both projects are included in the BARIWM Plan are working with the Novato Sanitary District to incorporate reuse of treated wastewater and can involve community-based restoration (through STRAW). Novato Creek Phase I would restore approximately 80-plus acres of former tidal marsh along the freshwater/saltwater mixing gradient and reestablish important ecological function and fluvial processes with the historic floodplain. The project will demonstrate multi-objective benefits for both habitat enhancement and flood control by combining urban flood protection for downtown Novato with shoreline and habitat adaptation to sea level rise. The Bel Marin Keys Wetland Restoration project will construct flood protection necessary to restore a mix of wetlands habitats on the 1576-acre Bel Marin Keys property preparing the site for seasonal and tidal marsh restoration. It will construct a new flood management levee to separate tidal and non-tidal areas assist in the protection of the adjacent Bel Marin Keys residential community from flooding and develop approximately 360 acres of seasonal wetlands. East Bay   Eden Landing/Hayward Marsh Complex The Eden Landing portion of the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration (SBSPR) project and the Hayward Marsh Restoration Project are both included in the Bay Area IRWM Plan. These projects can involve community-based restoration in partnership with Save the Bay. For the SBSPR portion of this project large-scale tidal wetland restoration (over 2000 acres) will be implemented in conjunction with an innovative bayside berm approach (a FEMA-compliant feature that functions like a natural barrier island) to provide flood protection for thousands of homes and businesses. Restored interior wetlands would be used to dampen the incoming tides allowing inner levees within the ponds to be subject to much lower water levels and wave heights thereby providing multiple layers of tidal flood protection and vastly improved habitat values. For the Hayward Marsh portion of this project rehabilitation of the capacity and functions of the bayside ponds would result in the rehabilitation of wetlands that reduce the ammonia load in San Francisco Bay improve habitat for critical species such as the California Least Tern improve the resiliency of the local shoreline the wastewater distribution system and flood control features to assist with sea level rise. Peninsula   SAFER Bay and Ravenswood Restoration The San Francisquito Creek JPA s SAFER Bay project and the SBSPR project s Ravenswood complex in Menlo Park will provide critical flood risk management infrastructure and facilitate large-scale tidal marsh restoration. Though new to the plan the SAFER Bay project is coupled with the SBSPR Project and can be integrated through an update. The SAFER Bay project will provide tidal flood protection to East Palo Alto Menlo Park and Palo Alto homes private businesses public lands and facilities of the State with the objective of protecting these communities against tidal surges and the impacts of 50 years of projected sea level rise. Habitat protection and restoration are primary objectives through direct restoration design elements (such as horizontal levees and increased transitional ecotone habitat) and by providing flood protection measures to ensure future restoration in adjacent SBSPR Project Ponds R1 R2 and R3 do not increase tidal flood risk to the community. Resilience features include: upland fill material that may be used to create a levee with an outboard slope ratio up to 30:1 (horizontal: vertical) enhancing transition zone between the ecosystems of the restored wetlands and the adjacent upland infrastructure. Public access enhancements may include upgrades to the Bay Trail. South Bay - Mountain View Shoreline The South Bay Salt Pond Restoration project in Mountain View includes large-scale tidal marsh restoration while providing critical flood risk management infrastructure for adjacent residences and businesses. The project area consists of a cluster of former salt ponds (Pond A1 Pond A2W Charleston Slough) the levees surrounding each pond some of the fringe marsh outside of the pond and slough levees Permanente Creek and Mt. View Slough. Restoration activities include breaches of levees at various locations creation of wildlife habitat features and other levee alterations to improve the overall ecological conditions of Pond A1 Pond A2W and Charleston Slough. Resilience features include: upland fill material that may be used to create upland transition zones slope ratios of up to 30:1 to buffer ecosystems and provide resiliency to sea level rise by providing wetland migration accommodation space and reducing wave run-up impacts for adjacent levees. Viewing and interpretative platforms and trails would be established to improve recreation and public access to the pond cluster. Alternative projects that could be integrated if desired include the Richardson Bay Engineered Bay Beach Shoreline Demonstration project to develop alternatives to shoreline armoring by using coarse grain bay beaches ($500K to $2.2 million). Ecotone transition slope revegetation could be implemented for the Sears Point Wetland Restoration Project ($350K). The East Bay Regional Park District s Albany Beach and Bay Point Restoration and Public Access projects ($500K-$1.2 million and $500K-$1.1 million) are both in later stages of design and have significant non-state matching funds available. More information on these is available upon request. ","Project Need: The historic loss of wetlands in the region along with the multiple water quality flood protection and habitat benefits they provide presents one of the greatest ecological and economic challenges the region faces. In addition climate change and in particular sea level rise present risks to tens of billions of dollars of infrastructure. This proposal will develop site-specific solutions to paired flood control habitat water quality and re-use challenges while developing and testing regionally-relevant techniques necessary to address the future impacts of sea level rise. The Program responds to four of the Regional Priorities including: Climate Change: The Program fits all the criteria for a Shoreline Sustainability Climate Change Project. It is the outgrowth of several regional vulnerability assessments including work by the Pacific Institute and BCDC and directly builds on the Baylands Ecosystem Habitat Goals  recommendations regarding climate change; demonstrates an ability to reduce shoreline vulnerability to climate change addressing potential future sea level rise and documenting metrics of benefit; demonstrates innovation in testing new resilience strategies; provides data and proof of concept for regional strategies; and includes ecosystem adaptation and re-use of sediment and wastewater. Health of the Bay and Creeks: The Program provides direct water quality benefits to the bay reducing pollutants and enhancing fisheries and native and endemic wildlife populations around the bay margin. It protects restores and rehabilitates watershed and bay processes reintroducing more natural sediment and freshwater flows improving floodplain connectivity and reducing shoreline (and marsh edge) erosion. Sediment Management: The Program helps address conflicting goals with sediment management in particular regarding re-use of dredged material in the bay; integrates habitat concerns through beneficial sediment re-use; and anticipates being able to determine the incremental costs of beneficial re-use in these settings. Invasives Management: The Program assists with the management of invasive spartina a species of regional concern. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Without the proposed projects progress in reversing the historic loss of baylands habitats called for by the BAIRWMP the Baylands Ecosystem Habitat Goals Basin Plan CCMP and other regional plans will be greatly slowed and in places halted. In addition the impacts of sea level rise are projected to be most greatly felt along shorelines without established integrated shoreline solutions that can jointly achieve habitat goals while providing shoreline protection; these projects represent the most significant currently-planned contributions to ensuring that resilience in the region. The projects all include testing of key design and engineering questions crucial to future shoreline sustainability including: restoring multiple components of diverse complex baylands facilitating improved re-use of in-channel and bay sediment incorporating re-use of treated wastewater into restoration designs effectively constructing and enhancing terrestrial transition zones and high-tide refugia and designing self-sustainability into marsh and planting designs. Without the implementation of these projects the region s ability to move forward quickly with shoreline resilience measures at a significant scale will be reduced and delayed. Restoration sites will not be able to establish as quickly as they need to ensure their best chance of keeping up with sea level rise. And crucial technical permitting and management questions will remain unanswered further delaying similar action around the region. ","Project Benefits: The Resilience Program will provide tangible and measureable benefits to the region: critical flood protection for four regions of the bay including thousands of commercial transportation and residential assets through approximately 7 miles of climate resilient structural solutionsrestoration of approximately 3700 acres of baylands to a diversity of natural tidal and shallow water habitats improving freshwater inflow and natural sediment transport processes and providing habitat for rare and endangered tidal marsh species as well as rearing and nursery habitat for anadromous and bay fisheriesappropriate transitional habitat and buffers to sea level rise through creation of high-tide refugia gently sloping transition-slope levees natural flood protective structures and living shorelines reuse of sediment and freshwater in innovative ways demonstrating technical capacity to scale shoreline solutions up throughout the region. Based on initial analysis and similar proposals in the past the program is expected to demonstrate at minimum a greater than 1:1 and likely higher than 3:1 Benefit/Cost ratio. Particular project outcomes include: Novato Creek: construction of 4500 linear feet of new SLR adaptive set-back levees designed with eco-tone transition habitat; restoration of approximately 80 plus acres of tidal wetlands and floodplain in Deer island reconnected to Novato Creek; creation of complex habitat along the freshwater/saltwater salinity gradient and restoration and enhancement of seasonal wetlands; flood protection for City of Novato; beneficial reuse of dredged sediment; relocation and consolidation of existing storm-water pumping facilities to respond to sea level rise conditions. Bel Marin Keys: 1.7-mile long  ecotone  levee; assist in protection of 700 homes from flooding; potential reuse of up to 5 MGD of treated wastewater to restore wetlands; beneficial reuse of dredged sediment from regional dredging projects; eventual creation of 1450 acres of salt marsh brackish marsh mudflat and sub-tidal habitats;   mile of new Bay Trail. Eden Landing: Restoration of over 2000 acres of tidal marsh implemented in conjunction with an innovative bayside berm approach to providing flood protection for thousands of homes and businesses; new connections between the Alameda Creek anadromous fishery and the bay and improved alignments of the Bay Trail spine. Hayward Marsh: Enhanced function and sustainability for 145 acres of wetlands; up to 20 MGD of wastewater reuse; ammonia load reduction in San Francisco Bay improved habitat for critical species such as the California Least Tern improved resiliency of the local shoreline the wastewater distribution system and flood control features to assist with sea level rise. Ravenswood: 1 mile of flood protection for State Highway 84 a PG&E regional substation and properties landward of these facilities as well as up to 590 acres of restored tidal wetlands in Ponds R1 and R2. Mountain View: Restoration of over 800 acres of tidal marsh habitat and provide an estimated 1.5 miles of shoreline protection helping prevent flooding to the shoreline communities of Mountain View and Palo Alto comprising several thousand businesses and homes. Enhanced tidal/fluvial connections will help alleviate upstream flooding increase natural sediment delivery to the marshes improve local water quality and provide fisheries habitat on a known salmonid stream.

"10 ","San Francisco Bay Nutrient Reduction and Recycling Project ","This regional project will install innovative treatment facilities at multiple sites construct new recycling facilities and enhance monitoring (moored sensors) in the region to reduce nutrient loading into San Francisco Bay to: improve ecosystem health and water quality in San Francisco Bay; enhance water supply and flood protection; and provide other benefits including reduced greenhouse gas emissions reduced net energy consumption and reduced residual solids. The Project partners include the Bay Area Clean Water Agencies (BACWA) San Francisco Estuary Institute (SFEI) Re-inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt) Stanford University Union Sanitary District East Bay Regional Parks District and several sanitation and water districts implementing recycling or advanced wastewater treatment projects.

The site locations for this project are shown on the image file attached in Part 1. ","Project Type Description: This project will increase drinking water supply by increasing water recycling for non-potable uses to offset potable water currently serving these uses. The water quality in San Francisco Bay will be improved by reducing nutrient loading. The aquatic habitat of the Bay will be protected through reduced point source discharges and the Hayward Marsh area will benefit from restoration. Flood control levees in Hayward Marsh will also be improved by the Project. ","Detailed description: Recent evidence suggests that San Francisco Bay s resistance to its high level of nutrient loadings is weakening. Consequently the San Francisco Water Quality Control Board has indicated interest in developing nutrient loading allocations in the next 5-10 years. See Ref. Doc. #1. Similar nutrient removal strategies in other regions of the U.S. can approach $50-100 billion to implement through capital improvements improved monitoring/assessment and nutrient trading. This Project will reduce nutrient inputs into the Bay through implementation of: a. Zeolite-Anammox Total Nitrogen Removal System. Construct two full-scale or intermediate treatment systems and multiple pilot scale treatment systems at several Bay Area locations to remove nutrients and advance this technology by: i) refining pilot plant data for accurate construction cost estimates; and ii) generating enough bio-zeolite (zeolite colonized with bacteria) to seed further full scale systems. Three strengths of aquatic ammonia discharges can be de-ammonified: Side Stream (high strength) Mainstream (medium) and re-used water (low). See Ref. Document #2. Requesting $1.5M. b. Mobile Advanced Treatment Pilot. Construct small scale and/or trailer mounted wastewater treatment units at multiple locations to test advanced wastewater treatment (Staged Anaerobic Fluidized Membrane Bioreactor System [SAF-MBR] and Coupled Aerobic-Anoxic Nitrous Decomposition Operation [CANDO]) to remove nutrients and other constituents reduce energy use and enhance energy recovery. See Ref. Doc. #3. Requesting $1.5M. c. Hayward Marsh Restoration. Rehabilitate a 145 acre marsh on the eastern shore of SF Bay using reclaimed wastewater to improve wildlife habitat reduce wastewater nutrient loads to San Francisco Bay and improve flood control through levee strengthening. Approximately 2 mgd of wastewater will be used for this project and up to 20 mgd duding wet weather. Requesting $5M. d. Moored Sensors.

","Project Need: The San Francisco Bay Estuary is enriched with nutrients but thus far has not suffered from adverse environmental impacts such as eutrophication. Studies in recent years show signs that turbidity may be decreasing potentially breaking down the resiliency to nutrients. Capital costs to reduce nutrient loads from 37 publicly owned treatments works (POTWs) in the Bay Area differ in costs by billions of dollars. A technology based regulatory approach that requires all POTWs to reduce nutrients by 75% (to 5-7 mg/L N effluent concentration) or 90% (2 mg/L N) would cost up to $7.5 billion (Falk 2011). Targeted options may be as effective at much lower costs if advances in treatment technology and assessment tools can be improved. Water supply enhancements are critically needed during the ongoing drought in California and for future dry periods. Drought proof supplies such as recycled water are particularly valuable as they do not require importing water from distant watersheds. Business sectors are experiencing water cutbacks and economic losses that could be alleviated somewhat by development of additional recycled water supplies and capacity. Without increased water supplies economic losses and hardship on residential customers could increase in the future. Flood control improvements and marsh restoration are needed along the Bayfront to upgrade aging infrastructure and adapt to a sea level rise of two to five feet by 2100. Many of the existing levees were built around the same time as when the earliest cities were incorporated. Improvements to flood control infrastructure are needed to protect businesses and residents living in low lying areas near the Bay to help avoid large flood losses. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Nutrients - Studies in recent years show signs that turbidity may be decreasing potentially breaking down the resiliency to nutrients. The adjacent Delta region has already experienced significant declines for pelagic organisms due to multiple factors including nutrient enrichment (Interagency Ecological Program 2008-2013). Without an aggressive approach by regulators and stakeholders to develop and implement an effective nutrient strategy there will be uncertainty about the long lasting ecosystem health of San Francisco Bay. Increased regulation of nutrients could lead to billions of dollars for infrastructure improvements to meet more stringent requirements. Other regions of the United States have implemented strategies costing $20-$50 billion that focus on conventional treatment. A comparable approach in the Bay Area would result in new costs of up to $7.5 billion unless a more tailored approach is developed utilizing advanced treatment strategies combined with an enhanced scientific program. Water Supply   The ongoing four year drought in California has caused extensive economic impacts including losses in landscaping commercial losses at water dependent businesses and agriculture. These will continue to mount as the drought continues through the summer and fall of 2015 and potentially future years. Without additional sources of supply including recycled water the duration and severity of drought impacts will be more extensive. Habitat Impacts   Marshland habitat around San Francisco Bay has greatly declined from historic levels due to multiple causes including development dredging and filling and sedimentation. Continuing pressure will be exerted in coming years from projected sea level rise on the order of two to five feet by 2100. Without additional restoration projects around the Bay the existing wetlands could be degraded and the special status species that depend on them could face losses. These wetlands also serve as open space and recreational-education opportunities that are highly valued by Bay Area residents that need to be protected and enhanced. Flood Control Impacts   Numerous business homes and infrastructure are in the floodplain immediately adjacent to San Francisco Bay. A combination of aging flood protection infrastructure and rising sea level will continue to pose risks of flooding into the future without additional flood management improvement projects. ","Project Benefits: 1. Resource Stewardship. This project will reduce nutrient loading to San Francisco Bay at multiple locations and improve conditions over baseline conditions. Approximately 5.4 million pounds per year of nitrogen will be removed from SF Bay discharges (breakdown: Zeolite-anammox 2.3M lbs Optimization 2.0M lbs Recycling 0.8M lbs Hayward Marsh 0.3M lbs). The proposed treatment sites and recycling facilities are shown on the Project map. Further the proposed monitoring improvements (moored sensors) will improve knowledge/data to better characterize nutrient effects and focus ongoing projects on those providing the greatest benefit. The Hayward Marsh restoration will enhance 145 acres of wetlands that are significant wildlife habitat migratory birds (Forster s tern Caspian tern black skimmer western snowy plover and California least tern) including three freshwater basins (85 acres) and two brackish basins (60 acres). Approximately 2 million gallons per day (mgd) of wastewater will be used for this project and up to 20 mgd during wet weather. Collectively the project facilities and actions will meaningfully contribute to ongoing efforts to protect and restore San Francisco Bay habitat. 2. Water Supply. The proposed recycling facilities will collectively produce up to 8800 acre feet of water per year after construction is completed. These supplies will be largely drought proof as they rely on wastewater streams as the source of supply. This will offset use of potable water to serve these same needs and lessen some of the need to import alternative sources from distant watersheds (e.g. Delta). Additionally discharges to SF Bay including nutrients will be reduced. The final selections among the recommended projects will be made when the final grant solicitation is available from DWR. 3. Flood Management. The Hayward Marsh restoration effort will include improvements to flood control levees and help resist sedimentation. Dredged material will be used to restore other wetland/marsh areas that may also aid flood control efforts. 4. Infrastructure Avoided Cost. In addition to physical benefits this Project has tremendous potential to offset billions of dollars in capital investment that would otherwise be required if a conventional approach to nutrient removal (i.e. nitrifation de-nitrication) is mandated in the future. The cost for infrastructure upgrades to reduce total nitrogen in discharged effluent from 30 mg/L (current level) to 2 mg/L (90% reduction Level V) is estimated at a cost of $15 per gallon per day (Falk et al 2011). If that unit cost were applied to all Bay Area discharges approximately 500 mgd the resulting upgrade cost would be $7.5 billion. If the reduction target was less restrictive than 90% such as 3 mg/L (Level 4) then the estimate would be $3.0 billion; if 6 mg/L (Level 3) then the cost would be $2.6 billion; if 12 mg/L (Level 2) then the cost would be $1.7 billion. Evaluating the different load reduction scenarios to identify the most cost efficient and environmentally effective approach requires further advancements in innovative treatment and well calibrated models which are both aided by the proposed Project. If this Project accounts for 5% of the justification to move from Level V treatment costing $7.5 billion to Level 4 costing $3.0 billion (e.g. it is one of several key steps for a full justification) the avoided cost benefit attributable to this Project would be 5 percent of $4.5 billion or $225 million yielding a benefit/cost ratio for the entire Project of more than 4.0. Other scenarios (Levels 2 or 3) would also have large avoided costs and a high benefit/cost ratio. The methodology can be fully documented. 5. Emergency Preparedness. The mobile advanced treatment units have the potential to be deployed to produce recycled water during an emergency. They could be set up to produce recycled water to serve industrial or irrigation needs at facilities located near a suitable wastewater source (pipe) during an emergency if potable water is unavailable. 6. Energy Recovery Energy Savings. The Zeolite-Anamoxx and Advanced Mobile Treatment methods both use considerably less energy or can generate energy. The SAF-MBR treatment process using anerobic digestion of dissolved organics is projected to generate 946 kWh/MG while conventional treatment consisting of enhanced primary treatment activated sludge and anaerobic digestion consumes 340 kWh/MG. This project method is expected to result in a positive net energy change which can be quantified. When CANDO treatment method is used to remove nitrogen from side streams of anaerobic disgesters net electrical energy consumed is expected to decrease to 300 kWh/MG a 34% decrease compared to conventional treatment. This project method is expected to result in a positive net energy change that can be quantified. For the Zeolite-Anammox system influent options include gravity flow that can significantly reduce energy costs. The system is designed to require minimal maintenance. See Reference Documents #2 and 3 for more detail. 7. Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) emissions. The Advanced Mobile Treatment and Zeolite-Anammox systems use less energy and will result in fewer GHG emissions. Further the reduced amount of residual bio-solids after treatment will result in less truck trips for land application or burial. The amount of GHG emissions resulting from transport of biosolids is significant and can be calculated as: Dry solids/yr x Truck trips/Dry Metric Tons x average distance/trip x GHG emissions/mile x % of Dry solids land applied = Total GHG emissions. Values for Bay Area are: 153000 DMT/yr *29% land applied or buried* 1 truck/15 tons *30 mi ave/trip * 1.692kg CO2e/mi = 150000 kg CO2e /yr. The reduction attributable to this Project can be quantified and the valuation calculated after DWR specifies the economic parameters to use across years. 8. Reduced Solids Reduced Fouling Smaller Footprint. The Advanced Mobile Treatment processes (SAF_MBR CANDO) will produce less solids as compared to conventional treatment (0.30 ton/MG and 0.37 ton/MG respectively as compared to 0.48 ton/MG for conventional). Further less space is required because hydraulic residence time is reduced. The Zeolite Anammox system is well documented for producing very low sludge volumes and results in nitrogen gas and water as end products. Regional Impact - This project geographically spans San Francisco Bay San Pablo Bay and benefits the entire Estuary and Delta. The moored sensors portion of the project will significantly enhance monitoring capabilities in San Francisco Bay. The proposed facilities are distributed in each of the four sub-regions and each of the four functional areas are benefitted. Collectively the project components will produce significant direct results and better focus future actions to address nutrient loading. Regional Priorities addressed by the Project include: 1. Climate Change   This Project will improve shoreline sustainability near the Hayward Marsh by reusing approximately 2 million gallons per day of wastewater from Union Sanitary District as a resource for wetlands enhancement at Hayward Marsh and by improving flood control levees. 2. Regional Water Reliability / Long-term Sustainability   Up to 8800 acre feet per year of recycled water will result from the Project which is a sustainable supply not reliant on imports from distant watersheds. 3. Health of the Bay and Creeks   Reducing nutrient loading by roughy 5.4 million pounds per year and improving assessment capabilities will help restore bay processes and better focus future improvements on the most effective methods. 4. Sediment Management - Flood control improvements at Hayward Marsh will include re-use of dredged sediment at other flood control projects in the region. Collaboration - BACWA is a regional organization representing wastewater dischargers in all nine Bay Area counties. The partners involved with implementation include the San Francisco Estuary Institute ReNUWIt Stanford University Union Sanitary District and several other sanitation districts that will be making site improvements. Supporters of this project include the Interagency Ecological Program U.S. Geological Survey Bay Keeper Delta Science Center State and Federal Water Contractors Water Science Center. The BACWA Recycled Water Committee will continue to facilitate regional meetings to help arrive at final recycling grant facility selections. Scalability - This project is scalable and some of the facilities and actions would be reduced or reprioritized if there is a need to scale back the grant request with some reduction in benefits.

"11 ","Muir Beach Water Conservation Implementation "," ","('West Bay';) | Marin ","37.8622° N | -122.5814° W ","2/1/16 ","12/31/18 ","The community of Muir Beach along State Route 1 in Southern Marin County. ","Project Type Description: Muir Beach drinking water demand will be decreased because the project proposal will include conservation implementation measures of graywater reuse and rainwater catchment. Higher water flows improve dissolved oxygen and keep water temperatures down for wildlife and the entire ecosystem. Additional water tank storage will also enhance fire fighting capability and public safety where tens of thousands of visitors to the beaches and Muir Woods could be isolated in a fire or other emergency situation. Groundwater storage will improve because the drawn down by the community will be lessened with water savings totaling around 24 acre feet per year projected. Redwood Creek in Marin Muir Beach water quality will benefit from having more consistent seasonal flows because of less pumping of ground water. Those flows will protect federally endangered coho salmon by consistently raising of the water table and groundwater storage. That will enable restoration to successfully move forward. Habitat for all aquatic endangered and threatened species throughout the lower Redwood Creek will be immediately improved by conservation efforts outlined by state and federal agencies. Infiltration of groundwater will increase the sponge of the flood plain and slow release to improve summer and fall water cfs flows. Improvements to habitat increases resiliency within the system for wildlife and humans. ","Detailed description: The project will address the indirect draw down of water in Redwood Creek by the Muir Beach community and Pelican Inn. It will 1. Reverse the loss of water supply in Redwood Creek for highly endangered coho salmon (Of three year classes: 1 year class extirpated 1 year class removed to a hatchery 1 year class had only 4 nests). Low levels prevented outmigration and overall fish viability in the drought. Restoration of the Muir Beach wetlands for coho steelhead and red-legged frogs would be supported by the project and improve water quality for coho salmon survival. 2. Enhance water supply for the community and thousands of tourists in an emergency and where the creek and aquifer is the only supply. Federal and state recommendations include alternative water storage for fire fighting or another emergency that could be obtained by increasing storage. In an emergency the community has only about 5 days of water stored. 3. Build resilience into a vulnerable system for fish and people and where should the pumps fail there are approximately five days of supply at the current water usage. Rainwater storage would offset this part of the year and allow the tank to remain filled longer. We are proposing retrofit of qualifying homes and businesses for graywater systems to an average of $2500 per household= $377500. That would include re-plumbing diverters irrigation augmentation with graywater piping. The proposal includes the installation of rainwater catchment tanks. (varying sizes to landscape size/type and capacity) to an average of $4200 = $634200 per 150 homes and 1 business and provides Installation of 2 electric low water composting toilets in the community center (legal in Marin County) $15000 at $7500. Two Surveys and two education seminars would be conducted including: 4 community meetings held with the CSD to roll out plans and begin project. Approximate administrative and survey costs: $12300. to include outreach management assessment and providing recommended certified installers for project. Conduct surveys project monitoring and provide educational materials for a comprehensive community water conservation plan and infrastructure that will benefit the community the coho salmon and steelhead. Total projected savings of water with rainwater catchment and graywater systems we could save 12400 gallons per day (pop. 310 - average person uses 40 gallons per day for bathing dishes and laundry ) - or 4526000 gallons or 13.90 acre feet per year. This grant will enable the community to protect Redwood Creek and reliant species during this and future droughts while securing water for basic human needs and landscaping while protecting property values. 151 roofs times 1000 square feet = 623 gallons per inch =94100 gallons per inch community and x 35 average inches per year 3.3 million gallons or 10.13 acre feet. Together the savings of 13.90 acre feet plus 10.13 acre feet would equal 24 acre feet per year of water savings and water left in the hydrologic system of groundwater and the stream. This is an optimistic scenario based on capturing and using all rainwater and dependent on the resident's use and plumbing. Rainwater catchment may not have that potential and is dependent on containment size and frequency of storms and use.

It will provide water for use in irrigation flushing and recharge the existing aquifer. It will also provide an auxiliary supply in an emergency for all but potable uses. By reducing demand it also will decrease energy costs for pumping water to Muir Beach tanks. The project will enable more resiliency for humans and federally listed species in lower Redwood Creek and the associated aquifer through groundwater recharge and surface supply from rainwater tanks and graywater systems. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the project is not implemented extirpation of coho salmon is probably going to occur in the very near future because they are deprived of basic biological migration function of not being able to outmigrate and the water quality and quantity is so degraded. Hanging on by a thread water supply diminishment can be the difference between survival or mortality for coho salmon in Redwood Creek. Further federally and state listed impacted species that will be affected include steelhead red-legged frogs and the tidewater goby. By not having a sufficient and reliable water supply to accommodate the increasing stressors from climate change and drought that is occurring now the Muir Beach community may lose their water source or it can be even more severely impacted. Many homes have been expanded in recent years and new properties developed while the water permit hasn t changed. This trajectory encumbers limits and threatens the existing homeowners water rights with every expansion and new property. The community does not have resilience or augmentation built into their water plan that protects the water resource and also allows unencumbered use of water. The water supply that is currently pumped into their tanks will only last for about 5 days at the current rate use. There is no guarantee that with continued climate change and drought that the aquifer will remain viable or that water rights could not be challenged in the future. ","Project Benefits: The project would benefit the landowners residents the coho salmon and steelhead trout. Water quality temperature and supply would be improved. Groundwater recharge would be enhanced and because of the flood plain connection to the stream the flows of lower Redwood Creek would improve significantly. Potentially 14-24 acre feet of water could be left in the system accessible to fish if the project is realized. The project could prevent the extirpation of coho salmon steelhead tidewater goby and red-legged frogs all federally and state listed special status species. Awareness of water use and habitat impacts by landowners would be increased. Watershed stewardship would be enhanced through presentations and conscious use of water. The project would enhance resiliency during climate change the drought and in the event of an emergency such as fire or earthquake. Landowners would be able to continue to maintain healthy gardens and that would lessen the fire danger. ","  "," ","Watershed Alliance of Marin ","1","1","1","0","1","1","1","0"

Specifically the Project will eliminate one of three travel lanes on each side of a stretch of Caribbean Avenue in north Sunnyvale (approximately 120000 square feet) and the excess road area will be used to construct approximately 11620 square feet of bioretention rain gardens to capture and treat polluted road runoff and provide more than 40 parking spaces for Bay Trail visitors. The resulting street will be a notable demonstration of Sustainable Streets concepts   incorporating water quality treatment with multi-modal travel and pedestrian and bicyclist safety improvements. Integrating the rain gardens with Bay Trail parking will also create a unique watershed educational setting for hundreds of daily visitors and area employees.

","Project Type Description: The Project will provide water quality improvement stormwater improvements and infiltration by retrofitting an existing street with Low Impact Development bioretention features. Specifically the constructed bioretention areas will provide for stormwater retention infiltration and treatment where none currently exists. ","Detailed description: This Project will retrofit an existing arterial street with Low Impact Development water quality improvements increase visibility and access to the San Francisco Bay Trail and serve as an opportunity to educate Bay Trail users and high-tech company commuters about the connection between urban landscapes and the Bay. Specifically the project will eliminate one of three travel lanes on each side of a stretch of Caribbean Avenue in north Sunnyvale (approximately 120000 square feet) where the excess road area will be used to construct approximately 11620 square feet of bioretention rain gardens and provide more than 40 parking spaces for Bay Trail visitors. The bioretention areas will be designed to capture and treat the regional stormwater permit required runoff volume consistent with regional Green Street expectations. The rain gardens will be planted with California natives and adapted plants chosen for their low irrigation requirements pest resistance and proven performance in rain gardens. The Project is scalable and project and treatment areas can be adjusted if needed. This Project is located in the Moffett Industrial Park Sunnyvale s largest employment center with more than 30000 employees and housing corporate campuses for companies such as Yahoo! NetApp Juniper Networks and Lockheed Martin. Many of these company employees utilize the Bay Trail for recreational purposes throughout the day. Caribbean Avenue is also a commute route for area employees from highways 237 and 101. Additionally the Project is located at the entrance to Sunnyvale s EcoCampus housing the City s Water Pollution Control Plant and the Sunnyvale Materials and Recovery Transfer Station. Construction of the rain gardens and location of Bay Trail parking in this area will create an inviting gateway that connects the area s employees with the Bay and the critical environmental services provided at the City s EcoCampus. Moving the Bay Trail parking from its current somewhat hidden location next to the City s Water Pollution Control Plant to Caribbean Avenue will increase its visibility and can result in additional Bay Trail users increasing community awareness and appreciation of the Bay. The City will also explore the possibility of connecting the rain garden irrigation system with the City s recycled water system. This Project complements other City and Santa Clara Valley Water District projects in the area that will improve flood protection construct new trails and improve pedestrian and bicyclist safety. Studies show that climate change will affect sea level and precipitation patterns (frequency and intensity). Collectively these projects can result in important climate change and adaption benefits. Singularly this Project can contribute to climate change and adaption benefits. This Project can demonstrate how bioretention rain gardens by intercepting and capturing roadway runoff can increase stormwater management capacity. The newly constructed rain gardens can also reduce urban heat island effects in the area through the reduction in heat reflecting paved surfaces and increasing native vegetation that can provide a natural cooling effect in the area. The resulting street will be a notable demonstration of Sustainable Streets concepts and create a unique watershed educational setting for hundreds of daily visitors. ","Project Need: The Bay Area IRWM Plan identifies key regional challenges including Regulatory Compliance Challenges (which include challenges with achieving and maintaining stormwater requirements) and Financial and Funding Challenges (including lack of funding to comply with stormwater permit obligations). This Project would demonstrate how stormwater treatment features can be integrated with other public improvement projects. Additionally implementation of the Project would add to the understanding of costs of green infrastructure improvements. The Caribbean Avenue Green Street Project uses Low Impact Development techniques proven to treat stormwater runoff from road running through a light industrial area. This Project will reduce the overall volume of runoff and provide treatment of previously untreated flows. The newly constructed rain gardens will also reduce urban heat island effect in the area through the reduction in heat reflecting paved surfaces and increasing native vegetation that can provide a natural cooling effect in the area. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Not implementing this proposal will further substantiate the challenges identified by local agencies in 2013 Bay Area IRWM Plan related to Regulatory Compliance and Financial and Funding Challenges. Local agencies including Sunnyvale will continue to struggle with how to meet increasing stormwater requirements specifically related to green infrastructure planning and implementation and agencies will continue to grapple with green infrastructure implementation with a lack of information and understanding of the costs associated with these types of projects. Additionally the long term water quality benefits provided by the bioretention areas designed to treat street runoff and remove sediment and other pollutants of concern will not be realized. ","Project Benefits: Water Quality Benefits: It is commonly known that public streets in the Bay Area contribute polluted stormwater runoff to local waterways and in turn to San Francisco Bay. The EPA s  Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff  identifies primary urban runoff pollutants as sediment sediment-bound pollutants such as heavy metals PCBs and pesticides and hydrocarbons and oil and grease from motor vehicles. These pollutants can harm fish and wildlife kill native vegetation and adversely impact recreational areas. Through the construction of approximately 11620 square feet of bioretention areas the project will improve water quality by providing for landscape based treatment and pollutant removal of untreated road runoff prior to flowing to the Bay. Stormwater and Flood Management Benefits: Through the construction of bioretention areas the Project will reduce the quantity of stormwater flowing to the Bay. By design bioretention features capture and retain stormwater and promote infiltration. Underdrains are included to facilitate release of treated stormwater when retention capacity is exceeded. Resource Stewardship Benefits: This Project creates a visible access point to the Bay Trail that intersperses rain garden treatment areas with public parking for Bay Trail users. Relocating the parking area from a hidden location next to Sunnyvale s Water Pollution Control Plant can increase awareness of the Bay Trail among area employees and visitors increase Bay Trail use and increase watershed and Bay stewardship. Interpretive signage will be placed at key locations highlighting the benefits of the rain gardens educating visitors about the connection between the urban landscape and the Bay and the importance of Bay protection actions.

","Detailed description: East Bay Regional Park District proposes to create restore enhance and protect 150 acres of crucial habitat in Breuner Marsh at Point Pinole Regional Shoreline Park in the northwest part of the City of Richmond on the San Francisco Bay shoreline Contra Costa County California. The goal of this wetland restoration project is to provide long-term self-sustaining tidal wetlands seasonal wetlands and coastal prairie to create valuable habitat for special status species and for public access for compatible passive recreation and public education. The project will provide and enhance approximately 60 acres of wetlands and 90 acres of coastal prairie will be restored or enhanced. Wetlands restoration will aid in reducing polluted run-off from surrounding urban industrial areas by providing a natural filtering system of marshland vegetation. Due to the combination of wetlands and upland areas the project will provide a transitional area to mitigate the effects of extreme high-tide events caused by sea level rise due to climate change. To aid in public education regarding the fragile marsh habitat public access improvements will include interpretive exhibits and provide for new naturalist-lead tours of the restored marsh and promote public health by increasing outdoor recreational opportunities for the adjacent under-served community of primarily low-income and minority residents. ","Project Need: The goal of this wetland restoration project is to provide long-term self-sustaining tidal wetlands seasonal wetlands and coastal prairie to create valuable habitat for special status species and for public access for passive recreation and public education. It provides water resource related recreational opportunities to lower income residents in Richmond. It is adjacent to the high density underserved neighborhoods of Parchester Village Bayview-Montalvin Tara Hills Rollingwood and the Iron Triangle in Richmond. Much of Richmond s historic shoreline has been lost to industrial uses and is no longer accessible to the public. Marshes have been filled invaded by non-native species polluted and fragmented. However the seven-mile stretch of shoreline from Point San Pablo to Point Pinole represents one of the last remaining shorelines still largely intact. This wetland complex contains an estimated 540 acres of tidal marsh and more than 900 acres of tidal flat. Lying just offshore is the largest eelgrass bed in the entire San Francisco Bay all of which helps to support a diverse population of waterbirds fish and other wildlife. A broad tidal flat once bordered most of this portion of San Pablo Bay. A string of small tidal marshes existed in coves along this shoreline at the mouths of several creeks. A large tidal marsh spanned much of the area between the San Pablo Peninsula and Point Pinole with extensive areas of moist grasslands bordering on the upland edge. Today the area contains considerable industrial development. Much of the historic tidal marshes and wetlands have been filled for heavy industrial uses and landfills. The proposed project will occur at one of the few tidal marshes remaining in the area. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Existing wetland areas would be enhanced by excavating new channels to connect them to the Bay and allow tidal flooding. Material removed from wetland areas would be used to build upland areas with gentle slopes and to create broad transitional zone habitat. The transitional zone would become a future tidal marsh as sea level rises in line with predictions. The goal is to provide long-term self-sustaining tidal wetlands seasonal wetlands and coastal prairie to create valuable habitat for special status species and for public access for compatible passive recreation and public education. Restoration and enhancement of Breuner Marsh will increase natural habitat values of the site for marine intertidal and upland species. Restoration and enhancement at Breuner Marsh will focus on developing self-sustaining ecological habitats with a minimal amount of long-term human intervention. Public access will focus on developing recreational facilities that are compatible with restored habitats and that require a minimum level of maintenance. Restoration of this former marsh allows for expansion of subtidal-to-wetland-to-upland transitional areas that are present at only a few East Bay locations. This property provides an especially important opportunity to maintain viable habitats in the face of anticipated sea level rise. Enhancing existing seasonal wetlands and creating new seasonal wetlands will provide greater connectivity with other habitats. Enhancement and creation of new coastal prairie and upland buffer will increase the value of transitional areas between ecological habitats. Benefits of these restoration efforts include establishing protected cover and shorebird foraging areas as well as roosting nesting and brooding sites. Special status species that will benefit from this project include salt marsh harvest mouse California clapper rail and California black rail all of which are present in the project area. Creating restoring and enhancing tidal marsh and seasonal wetlands at Breuner Marsh will greatly improve ecological conditions for wetland dependent species at this location on San Pablo Bay. Improved habitat for small mammals and birds such as salt marsh harvest mouse California clapper rail and California black rail will aid in the recovery of these species. Re-establishing a wetland corridor between Wildcat/San Pablo Creek marshes and Breuner/Giant Marsh will link these existing habitat areas increase wetland acreage and reduce isolation of plant and animal populations. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) The shallow zone groundwater was considered as a possible source for irrigation water but the pH levels and salinity make it very marginal to unusable. The deeper aquifer is considerably more saline with TDS levels reported to be in the range of 4100 milligrams per liter (mg/l) to as much as 9400 mg/l. The State Water Resources Control Board considers that water with TDS levels exceeding 3000 mg/l are not reasonably expected to be a public water supply (SWRCB Resolution 88-63). Based on pH levels and salinity neither aquifer is considered to be a source of drinking water or irrigation water supply. ii. Water Quality Much of Richmond's historic shoreline has been lost to industrial uses and is a point source of pollution in the bay. Marshes have been filled fragmented polluted and invaded by non-native species. However the seven-mile stretch of shoreline from Point San Pablo to Point Pinole represents one of the last remaining shorelines still largely intact. The goal of this wetland restoration project is to provide long-term self-sustaining tidal wetlands seasonal wetlands and coastal prairie that will provide and enhance valuable habitat. Wetlands restoration will aid in reducing polluted run-off from surrounding urban industrial areas by providing a natural filtering system of marshland vegetation. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Due to the combination of wetlands and upland areas the project will provide a transitional area to mitigate the effects of extreme high-tide events caused by sea level rise due to climate change. The high-tide marsh zone once kilometers deep is now an interrupted band averaging approximately 2 meters deep due to diking fill and urban development. Extreme high tide events exacerbated by increased numbers of severe storms and expected sea level rise due to climate change cause catastrophic flooding of marshes. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The restoration plan will focus on establishing proper elevations and soil balance through a grading plan. The approach will not attempt to  engineer  a pre-determined tidal marsh but will provide a setting for the natural evolution of wetland functions (including sea-level rise) and interplay of natural ecologic processes to restore the preexisting marsh. The goal is to provide long-term self-sustaining tidal wetlands seasonal wetlands and coastal prairie to create valuable habitat for special status species and for public access for compatible passive recreation and public education.

","Project Type Description: Flood protection is increased by routing storm flows from the over-capacity Bayfront Canal to the salt ponds as detention. Storm flows from the Bayfront Canal will enhance the habitat quality of the salt ponds positively contributing to the salt pond restoration effort. ","Detailed description: The Bayfront Canal maintained by Redwood City through easement is the single stormwater transmission canal for the Atherton Channel and six drainage basins discharging through a single outlet to Flood Slough and into the Bay. In addition to Redwood City neighboring jurisdictions including unincorporated San Mateo County the cities of Atherton and Menlo Park and the Town of Woodside all generate runoff into the Bayfront Canal via flows from the Atherton Channel and/or other drainage basins. Flooding occurs in the neighborhoods and communities around and near the Bayfront Canal and Atherton Channel. During storms that coincide with high tides the Canal and Channel cannot discharge sufficient stormwater flows to the Bay because of tide gate limitations. Depending on the intensity of the storm the Canal and the Channel do not have enough detention capacity to prevent flooding in low lying areas. This project proposes to route flood flows from the Bayfront Canal and Atherton Channel into the managed ponds that are part of the Ravenswood Pond Complex and the South Bay Salt Ponds Restoration project. Ponds S5 & R5 of the Ravenswood pond complex currently are managed ponds adjacent to Bayfront Park and Flood Slough and flood flows from the Canal will be bypassed around the Flood Slough tide gate and routed into these ponds to facilitate the development of a seasonal wetlands habit and help mitigate the flooding problem.

The project will also provide new marsh habitat that will be home to a variety of bird and fish species thereby improving several Beneficial Uses of San Pablo Bay. The treated waste-water would be used beneficially to restore fresh and brackish marsh habitat along the newly constructed shoreline. During the dry season this waste-water is currently applied to spray-fields located between Highway 37 and Novato Creek. The project would change the management of the waste-water to a year-round diversion from bay discharge. This change will have the added benefit of making the spray fields available for other public uses (they are owned by Marin County). The Bel Marin Keys community a 700-home residential development will benefit from a new flood protection levee that would be integrated into the wetland design. ","Detailed description: The project will improve water quality in San Pablo Bay by removing a source of waste-water that is discharged offshore during the wet season. Instead the waste-water would be used beneficially for marsh habitat along the newly constructed shoreline. The waste-water is currently applied to spray-fields located between Highway 37 and Novato Creek in the dry season. The project would change to a year-round diversion of which would have the added benefit of freeing the spray fields for other public uses (they are owned by Marin County). The ecosystem of San Pablo Bay would benefit from a major increase in the increase of new tidal marsh mudflats and shallow [sub] tidal habitat - which would total over 1400 acres. The Bel Marin Keys community a 700- home residential development will benefit from a new flood protection levee that would be integrated into the wetland design. Description of Qualitative Benefits : For water quality it is assumed that a sizable increase in tidal marsh will lead to improved water quality and enhance the beneficial uses of San Pablo Bay for example recreational fishing. The restored site would have full tidal action over 1500 acres of marsh which would have benefits for the aquatic ecosystem. In terms of restoration the project will directly benefit dozens of fish and bird species including several that are threatened and endangered. Though the site is open to the public it is not managed as a park or open space and is a partially active hay farm. The restoration project would enhance recreation and public access by providing a higher quality environment (seasonal and tidal marsh) and will result in 0.7 miles of public trail along the margin of the site. Types of recreation anticipated include hiking and bird watching non-motorized boating fishing waterfowl hunting. The project will include a new flood management levee which will separate tidal and non-tidal areas. The new levee would be built to a higher elevation than the existing perimeter levee and so is expected to provide a higher level of flood protection to the neighboring residential community. The project will be constructed in phases. Each phase will comprise some 500 to 600 acres of tidal marsh. Some volume of dredged material will be placed in the [future] tidal portion of each phase and when the phase is complete the outboard levee will be breached thereby providing immediate benefits to that phase. Dredged material will be placed against the new flood management levee to create a low gradient fill or 'bench' which will lead to immediate growth of marsh vegetation. ","Project Need: San Pablo Bay and the greater San Francisco Bay has lost about 90 percent of its historic tidal marsh habitat due to farming and development. This project would restore over 1500 acres of tidal wetland and mudflat habitat which will benefit a wide array of bird and fish species including several that are threatened and endangered. The project would also restore up to 400 acres of seasonal wetlands and provide flood protection for 700 homes. The project will beneficially reuse waste-water. The Novato Sanitary District (NSD) discharges an average of 10.3 million gallons per day of treated effluent into San Pablo Bay. The discharge only occurs in the wet season due to concerns over a lack of dilution at the outfall; in the dry season the effluent is discharged on to fields leased to the District by the County of Marin. This project would use the effluent to restore fresh and brackish water habitat within the newly constructed marsh complex. One outcome of this project is that the spray fields (currently used to dispose of summer flows) could be rendered obsolete thereby freeing up the fields for other uses. NSD is currently working on recycling of waste-water including a regional system (North Bay Water Reuse Authority); however it is unlikely that in the short and medium term there will be a substantial reuse of wet weather flows due to infrastructure and storage constraints. Reuse of waste-water at the subject restoration project provides a reuse option that is immediate and which does not preclude regional recycling in the future. The project will restore tidal wetlands by recycling dredged sediment that would otherwise be disposed of in the bay and ocean. The project uses the dredged sediment as fill. The BMK property like the adjacent Hamilton Airfield is a subsided former baylands and across the site the current ground elevations range from five to six feet below mean sea level. In order to accelerate marsh development the site will be filled with dredged sediment using a suction dredge and hydraulic slurry. Sediment is delivered by barge from dredging projects throughout the Bay Area. Only sediment that has been tested and approved for restoration purposes will be placed onsite. The material is transferred from barges to the site as a slurry (hydraulic placement) which is far more efficient than mechanical placement and also recreates the gradual gradients found in nature. The project benefits the ecosystems of San Francisco Bay and the deep ocean because it makes use of dredged sediment to re-construct wetlands which would otherwise be disposed of into the water column with numerous impacts (at designated dump sites). The project will protect a residential development from flooding in that the wetland design incorporates a new flood management levee. The levee takes the place of the existing 3.3- mile long levee that runs along the perimeter of the site. The existing levee was constructed by farming interests in the 1880s and is protected from erosion by a mixture of rip-rap and fringing salt marsh. The existing levee has had minor failures in the last decade necessitating spot repairs totaling a half of a linear mile. The new 1.7-mile long levee will be constructed to a higher elevation than the existing levee will be engineered and protected from wave erosion by the newly constructed salt marsh. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The State of California (Coastal Conservancy) will continue to incur expenses of levee upkeep and property management in order to protect the Bel Marin Keys community from flooding. The effluent from the Novato Sanitary District will continue to be discharged into San Pablo Bay with no added benefit to the environment. The State's investment in the Bel Marin Keys property (over $16 million) for fish and wildlife habitat enhancement and protection will not be realized. Endangered and other listed bird and fish species in San Pablo Bay will continue to struggle to recover a viable population due to a lack of suitable habitat. Novato's waste-water which is treated to a high standard will continue to be discharged into the Bay in the wet season with no added benefit to the environment. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ii. Water Quality: Project will restore over 1500 acres of tidal wetlands which will improve the water quality of San Pablo Bay (Beneficial Uses). Also see Section iv below. The project would also beneficially use treated waste-water from the Novato Sanitary District changing discharge from a wet-season bay discharge to a year-around recycling to restore fresh / brackish marsh on site. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management The project purpose is not flood and stormwater management however the wetland design incorporates a new flood management levee that will help protect the Bel Marin Keys residential community from flooding. The existing perimeter levee that runs some 3 linear miles along Novato Creek and San Pablo Bay will be replaced by a 1.7 mile long engineered levee that will bisect the site dividing it between tidal and seasonal wetlands. Currently the 700-home Bel Marin Community is protected from San Pablo Bay tides by the existing perimeter levee and storage on the site. The new levee will be built to a higher elevation and will be better protected from erosion than the existing levee system. ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) ... Restoring the BMKV Expansion site would result in approximately 1785 acres of tidal wetlands seasonal and upland habitat for fish and wildlife.

Juvenile green sturgeon and longfin smelt now listed as an endangered species in the San Francisco Bay Estuary may also benefit from the restoration project. Tidal marshes are among the most productive ecosystems in the world. They flourish when the rate of sediment accumulation is equal to or greater than the rate of land subsidence and where there is adequate protection from large waves and storms. Wetlands are areas of high nutrient and biological productivity that provide the detrital products that constitute the base of the food chain. Sediment and epiphytic algae are often important components of the autotrophic community. Heterotrophic communities are often dominated by the detrital food chain of tidal wetlands providing foraging habitat for several threatened and endangered species. In addition tidal marshes are out-welling systems that export organic matter to adjacent estuaries. Tidal marshes provide direct prey resources to several aquatic and terrestrial organisms including listed juvenile salmonids. Because they are generally rich in invertebrate organisms tidal wetlands and mudflats that would be created as part of the BMKV restoration project could provide high-value foraging habitat for juvenile salmonids Shallow tidal wetlands and salt-tolerant vegetation (grasses and rushes) can provide refugia from predators. Some studies suggest that juvenile salmonids that rear in wetland areas growlarger and therefore may be less prone to predation when they enter the marineenvironment. Restored tidal wetlands may also directly benefit other species including starry flounder and English sole which are known to use tidal wetlands for rearing and Sacramento splittail which may use wetland habitat for spawning and rearing. Tidal wetlands may also indirectly benefit several protected species that do not directly use tidal wetland habitat (e.g. EFH-managed species that inhabit San Pablo Bay). Export of organic detritus from tidal wetlands can increase primary productivity in adjacent estuaries. Detritus that flows to the estuarine waters can sustain prey species for several aquatic organisms and help support secondary production especially in estuaries where plankton primary production is depressed. Studies suggest that organic detritus either filtered from the water or ingested from the sediment is an important alternate source of energy for aquatic organisms especially when plankton concentrations are low. Tidal wetlands can act as a buffer against the effects of sea level rise by stabilizing shorelines and creating a buffer against erosion. Tidal wetlands can also sequester carbon and thereby help offset the emission of green house gases. Creation of wetland habitat through implementation of the project would have direct benefits to fisheries and the ecological health of through implementation of the project would have direct benefits to fisheries and the ecological health of SF Bay and adjoining ocean by significantly reducing if not completely eliminating dredged material placement in the ocean and bay while BMK is being filled. There will also be benefits to benthic communities located at and near Alcatraz the other two in-bay sites and the deep-ocean water column that result from the diversion of dredged material to the ATF and hence to the BMK. Once the BMK is returned to tidal action bay fishes will benefit from the newly-restored wetland habitats by reducing if not completely eliminating dredged material placement in the ocean and bay while BMK is being filled. There will also be benefits to benthic communities located at and near Alcatraz the other two in-bay sites and the deep-ocean water column that result from the diversion of dredged material to the ATF and hence to the BMK.

Project will include modification of project levees acquisition of flowage easements and possible reconfiguration of the channel conveyance to better accommodate sediment and habitat. Also includes robust public participation and recreational components. ","('East Bay';) | Contra Costa County ","38.023264 | -122.070609 ","2014 ","2020 ","Lower Walnut Creek north of Highway 4 and East of I-680. North of the City of Concord and east of the City of Martinez. The specific limits are the mouth of Susuin Bay upstream to the BNSF Railroad (2.5 miles) plus an additional 1.5 miles of the lowest reach of Pacheco Creek. ","Project Type Description: This project will preserve and enhance in-stream and adjacent marshland habitat while maintaining or improving the design level of flood protection. It also provides a direct water quality improvement by expanding constructed wetlands providing stormwater treatment benefits. ","Detailed description: The Walnut Creek watershed is the largest in Contra Costa County draining over 150 square miles and containing eight cities and over 300000 residents. The lowest or most downstream portion of this watershed is called Lower Walnut Creek and it consists of a wide trapezoidal earth channel with levees on one or both sides. It is populated with a diverse assortment of wildlife both in the water and in the adjacent marshlands. The channel is heavily impacted by sediment and has partially silted up which affects its flood carrying capacity. But removing the sediment also removes the habitat and wildlife and the sediment would quickly return. In essence the project is transforming this legacy facility into a a sustainable channel that provides critical flood protection in a way that is more compatible with the plants and animals that call the creek home. This can be accomplished by: Creating additional wetlands riparian habitat and revegetation potentialMoving back the channel levees in the lower reaches to provide additional capacity for floodwatersReducing de-silting costs and finding reuse sites for excess sediment from the project. Restoring the design level of flood protection by expanding conveyance and securing flowage easements over low risk parcels currently protected by the levees. Other objectives include expanding recreation and educational opportunities along the creek. This project was built by the Corps in the 1960s and has been problematic since it was constructed. In 2003 after decades of wrangling with the Corps the Flood Control District partnered with the Corps on a General Reevaluation Project. This produced excellent technical data (such as sediment studies hydraulic model wetland delineation and salmonid viability studies) but when Congress eliminated earmark funding the project stalled. In response the Flood Control District took the unusual step to request Congress deauthorize the lowest 4 miles of the 22 mile Walnut Creek system. This request was granted in the 2014 WRRDA legislation and now in local control planning can begin in earnest. The Flood Control District retained Environmental Science Associates (ESA) to lead the local planning effort. This effort in well underway with technical analyses and comprehensive stakeholder engagement proceeding simultaneously. The likely preferred alternative will consist of breaching or lowering approximately 3 miles of project levees to restore flood flows to wetland areas. This would augment habitat allow accumulated sediment (and habitat) to remain in the channel and would restore the design level of flood protection. Lower Walnut Creek is proud to be one of the demonstration projects included in the \"Flood Control 2.0\" program being let by SFEI. ","Project Need: Overview: Lower Walnut Creek today looks significantly different than when it was channelized over 60 years ago. Even back in 1963 when the Corps began its efforts in the watershed Lower Walnut Creek was far from pristine and untouched. Development: When farms and fields are developed into commercial residential and industrial uses areas where water used to drain into the soil became paved over. This new impervious surface meant that less water soaked into the ground and more ran off into creeks. Natural processes had formed the creeks to a certain size and this additional runoff meant the creeks flooded more often. To make matters worse some of the most desirable flat lands for farming and development were near the creek in its historic floodplain. The high value of this land set up tremendous pressures to reduce flood damages and tame the creek. Channelization: Historic aerial photos from 1939 show the alignment of Walnut Creek to be significantly different from when the Corps began work in 1963. In the 1940s and 1950s the natural creek was channelized by neighboring landowners to help keep stormwater in the creek and to pass it through the system efficiently. When the Corps was asked to help the situation in the 1960s the resulting project further widened the already channelized creek and constructed levees to allow the water to rise higher without escaping. The newly-formed Flood Control District (District) was the non-federal sponsor for this work by the Corps of Engineers and signed agreements saying they would own and maintain the channel in perpetuity. Calculations at the time showed the channel would need minimal maintenance and sufficient funds were available to perform this maintenance. Sediment: Soon after Lower Walnut Creek was handed over to the Flood Control District for maintenance it became clear that much more sediment was depositing in the creek than was originally calculated by the Corps. The Corps returned in 1973 and participated in dredging the lower channel removing over 850000 cubic yards of sand and mud. When the District prepared to dredge the channel again in the early 1990s it because clear that significant habitat for wildlife had formed in the channel since the last invasive dredge and getting regulatory permits necessary to do this work would prove difficult and enormously costly. This difficulty was compounded by the reduction in the district s property tax funds as a result of the passage of Prop 13 in 1978. Unfortunately leaving the habitat in place was not an acceptable maintenance practice in the eyes of the Corps of Engineers . This conflict put the District in a no-win situation: Should the District remove all the vegetation and habitat in the channel to restore it to its 1960s configuration? Should the District allow the sediment vegetation and habitat to remain but be out of conformance with the Corps maintenance requirements? The District ultimately chose a third option which was to deauthorize the project from the Federal system and proceed with a local project without the Corps oversight or assistance. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the project is not implemented opportunities for the habitat improvement would be lost and continued sediment accumulation would reduce flood carrying capacity. This would eventually lead to increased flood risk for neighboring property owners and for after a flood increased demands to \"clean out that creek!\" Instead the District's project provides a sustainable balance between flood protection and habitat improvement that makes the creek work better for all. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality ...Currently the habitat present in the stream help to slow and filter stormwater improving water quality. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ...The Lower Walnut Creek channel is the primary drain for 150 square miles and 300000 residents. It serves an extremely critical role in the drainage protection of large commercial industrial and residential areas. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) ...A fundamental component of the Lower Walnut Creek Restoration is the preservation of the habitat that has developed in the channel and to implement a project that would allow this habitat to remain. A very exciting part of the project is the recreational opportunities afforded by this project. Implementing Lower Walnut Creek paves the way for a long awaited EBRPD Iron Horse Trail Extension which would add the northen-most six miles to make the new terminus at the shore of Suisun Bay at the mouth of Walnut Creek. It also would intersect with the Great Delta Trail and support the new staging area and interpretative experience at Pacheco Marsh.

The tool will provide the means for agencies organizations and the interested public to prioritize restoration projects on a regional or local level based on various criteria and objectives. The tool will also provide the context and database structure for other projects studying the Bay shoreline and its resilience to sea level rise.

Approximately 85 creeks. This project does not include the Delta. ","Project Type Description: The Bay Area Creek Mouth Assessment Tool will facilitate identification and implementation of habitat restoration and flood protection projects. Habitat Protection and Restoration: Creek mouths are at the interface of fluvial and tidal processes which will be heavily impacted by climate change. Protection and restoration of these creek mouth habitats will not only preserve or enhance current conditions but also provide support for Bay-wide effects of climate change. Strategically selected creek mouths for restoration and/or preservation is the first barrier against sea level rise and the resulting flooding events. Flood Protection: Tidal marshes and adjacent riparian habitats are natural means to slow and retain flood water buffer storm surges and thus add protection from flooding to the surrounding low-lying land. ","Detailed description: The interface between tributaries and the Bay is one of the most ecologically important components of the Bay system. Historically these were the Bay's natural deltas; places of high ecological diversity and complexity. Then as now they were critically important as reliable rearing habitat for juvenile steelhead. These locations play a disproportionately important role in the sustenance of the Bay's tidal marshlands as the delivery points for watershed carbon and sediment. In addition these areas are critical for flood management and face increasingly high flood risk because of climate change and the predicted increases in storm intensity tidal surge and sea level. Restoring creek mouths to enhance or increase historical tidal and fluvial functions can increase critical habitat for birds wildlife and aquatic organisms and can while also reducing flood risk both along the shoreline and farther upstream. In 2012 the San Francisco Estuary Partnership and the San Francisco Estuary Institute undertook a comprehensive regional inventory and assessment of creek mouths around the Bay. Once complete (in 2013) this inventory and assessment will advance the Bay Area's ability to better integrate riparian tidal and subtidal restoration efforts for multiple benefits including increasing ecological value and reducing human health and hazard risks from flooding. Building on the completed inventory the Bay Area Creek Mouth Assessment Tool would provide an online interactive public interface for accessing the narrative and geospatial data collected for creeks around the San Francisco Bay. Providing access to the data in a user-friendly online interface allows agencies organizations and others in the Bay Area to better understand the regional opportunities for creek mouth restoration and prioritize limited funding. Furthermore providing important data on the present and historical ecology hydrology and land use in and adjacent to the creek mouths will support and advance ongoing and proposed restoration and flood protection projects. The Bay Area Creek Mouth Assessment Tool would provide access to both regional and local scale data on creek mouths. At a the regional scale (the Bay Area) the Tool would include data on: - Physical characteristics of the creek mouth: length width physical barriers - Presence of invasive plants (Spartina) - Presence (historic or current) of steelhead - Local interested parties ( Friends of  groups etc.) - Contamination history - Public/private land ownership profile At the local creek mouth scale the Tool would deploy precise geospatial layers including: - Adjacent restoration project boundaries - Public/private land boundaries - Public land ownership - Levees - Historical Ecology data The Bay Area Creek Mouth Assessment Tool project would where feasible and appropriate integrate with other user tools such as SFEI s Ecoatlas the San Francisco Bay Joint Venture Tracker and the Conservation Lands Network. The Tool will not duplicate other efforts but will offer unique functionality. Opportunities to collaborate with regional and local partners to share data and develop compatible user interfaces will be pursued and a strategy for collaborative and integrated data collection and management will be included in the project. ","Project Need: Agencies and organizations charged with identifying and implementing critical flood protection and habitat restoration projects do not currently have access to data that allows an analysis of opportunities and constraints in the critical fluvial/tidal interface areas. This project solves the need to provide this important information in an easy to use interface to state and regional agencies local governments and special districts nonprofit organizations and the others interested in understanding the restoration opportunities and constraints for Bay Area creek mouths. Without an opportunity to develop the online tool the extensive data already collected may not be available to all those who would benefit. Furthermore if the Tool is not created fewer critical multi-benefit flood protection and habitat restoration projects will be implemented as the data to support such projects will not be readily available. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Creek mouths are transition zones where the defined channel meets the open water pelagic zone of the estuary thus creating a unique ecotone. As sea levels rise the creek mouths become vulnerable to increased flooding impacting low lying communities drowning of marshland and an upstream migration of head of tide causing flooding upstream. Prioritizing restoration opportunities is a fundamental step to increasing the resilience of the Bay shoreline minimizing future flooding impacts and planning for the long term health of the Bay s marshes creeks and communities. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality One of the many ecosystem services that marshes provide is filtering runoff from the upstream creeks and urban areas thus cleaning water before it runs into the Bay. The Tool will lead to additional creek mouth restoration projects that will improve water quality of the Bay. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Prioritizing creek mouth restoration of marshes can have multiple benefits and impact decisions made by flood control districts stormwater managers and resource conservation districts. -protection from tidal flooding -filtering and buffering of fluvial flooding -stormwater wetlands to detain water Through an augmentation of restoration projects in the fluvial/tidal interface areas the Bay Area Creek Mouth Assessment Tool will enhance flood and stormwater management. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) This project would provide guidance for strategic resource stewardship by prioritizing restoration using metrics such as presence of endangered species public land and public access and presence of a watershed stewardship group. This project also fits into the goals of several resource agencies and non-profits working on bayland restoration and sea level rise.

"32 ","Sears Point Restoration Project ","The Sonoma Land Trust's 2327-acre Sears Point Restoration Project is located on the northern shore of San Pablo Bay in Sonoma County. Major project objectives include restoration of 955 acres of tidal marsh enhancement of seasonal wetlands and grasslands across 1300 acres of diked agricultural baylands and uplands and increased public access. Construction of a new 2.5-mile levee will provide transitional marsh/upland habitat a new section of the Bay Trail and greatly increased flood protection for State Highway 37 and the SMART railroad line. ","('North Bay';) | Sonoma ","38.1308563 | -122.466179 ","10/15/2012 ","12/31/2015 ","Southern Sonoma County San Pablo Bay between Petaluma River and Tolay Creek ","Project Type Description: Restored tidal and seasonal wetlands will provide a filtering function to stormwater runoff entering the bay. The wetland and upland restoration will increase the habitat available to numerous threaten and endangered species as well as common species. A new 2.5-mile levee and stormwater pumps will protect Highway 37 the SMART railroad and other lands from both saltwater and stormwater flooding. ","Detailed description: In 2005 the Sonoma Land Trust (SLT) acquired the 2327-acre Sears Point property a vital link along the northern San Pablo Bay shoreline connecting nearly five miles of protected and restored tidal marsh habitat from the Petaluma River to Tolay Creek. Unique among nearly all shoreline conservation properties Sears Point extends deep into the adjacent uplands reaching elevations of nearly 400 feet. Some nine miles of riparian corridors traverse its grasslands willow groves and broad plains of seasonal wetlands to connect upland to Bay. Slated for casino development prior to SLT s acquisition Sears Point is protected in perpetuity offering an unparalleled opportunity for landscape-scale restoration of multiple habitats in the North Bay. Over the next several years SLT will restore 955 acres of tidal marsh and nearly 1350 acres of associated ecotonal seasonal wetlands riparian corridors and upland grasslands. New stormwater pumps and a 2.5-mile flood protection levee will provide increased flood protection to State Highway 37 the SMART railroad and public and private lands. Gradual slopes on the levee's outer edge will enable creation of 23 acres of transitional marsh-upland habitat and a new 2.5-mile segment of the Bay Trail will be built on the levee crest. ","Project Need: Over 80% of the tidal marshes and 70% of seasonal wetlands surrounding the San Francisco Bay Estuary have been lost over the past 150 years. Intact tidal marshes provide vital ecosystem services including habitat stormwater filtration carbon sequestration and a buffer against tidal surge. The new flood control levee and stormwater pumps will provide increased flood protection to public (Highway 37) and private infrastructure on subsided lands. As seas level rises all of the project's actions will continue to grow in importance. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The existing 5-mile flood control levee was built more than 100 years ago and has been patched and repaired through the decades. A catastrophic failure is imminent. Failure to restore tidal marsh will hinder the ability to recover endangered species such as the California clapper rail and the salt marsh harvest mouse. Restoration of tidal marshes is critical to protecting people and infrastructure in the face of sea level rise in which oceans and tidal surges are predicted to rise substantially. ","Project Benefits: Water Quality Improvement: At Sears Point the primary sources of polluted runoff are from Highway 37 and agricultural fields. Because the lands are subsided runoff pools on the landward side of the levee and is then pumped to the Bay. While there is a small strip marsh on the outside of the levee the new marsh will be nearly 1000 acres and will greatly increase the filtering ability of the strip marsh. Additionally with the restoration and enhancement of seasonal wetlands riparian drainages and grasslands much of the stormwater that formerly drained from the watershed as sheet flow will slow and infiltrate into the uplands. Habitat Protection and Restoration: Nearly 1000 acres of estuarine habitat will be restored. Eventually it will be almost entirely composed of tidal marsh a habitat type that has been reduced by more than 80% around the SF Bay Estuary. This land is protected in perpetuity and will be transferred to the CA Department of Fish and Game after it is restored. Roughly 500 acres adjacent to the new tidal marsh will be transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for incorporation into the San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge. Seasonal wetlands will be enhanced across this acreage. The remaining 900 acres of upland grasslands will remain protected by Sonoma Land Trust. Flood Protection: Construction of the 2.5-mile levee will provide superior flood protection for State Highway 37 the SMART railroad track a and surrounding lands. The levee will serve not only to hold back the bay but also will be provide nearly 23 acres of transitional marsh-upland habitat on its gradual 10:1 to 20:1 outboard slopes. This habitat is vital refuge for marsh species during the highest spring tides and during storm surges. Additionally the Bay Trail will be built along the crest of the levee providing Sonoma County's premiere public access point to the Bay.

"37 ","Redwood Creek Restoration at Muir Beach Phase 5 ","The overall project will restore the lost natural function of lower Redwood Creek its estuary tidal lagoon adjacent floodplain and associated wetland and dune habitats over a 46-acre area. Lower Redwood Creek has been degraded by a century of landscape modifications and suffers from a lack of connectivity with its floodplain severe channel aggradation and loss of habitat for federally listed coho and steelhead. Phase 5 or the last phase of the project is proposed for IRWMP which entails relocating the last 1000 LF of the channel to its natural location when Marin County constructs a new vehicular bridge over the creek and its floodplain. The project is a partnership between the National Park Service Marin County Dept. of Public Works and the non-profit Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy. ","('North Bay';) | Marin ","37.52 | -122.35 ","02/01/2014 ","01/30/2019 ","Big Lagoon Muir Beach Marin County The project area is bounded by Hwy 1 on the easterly side the Pacific Ocean on the westerly side Coastal hills to the south and hillslopes occupied by residents of Muir Beach to the north. ","Project Type Description: The project provides stormwater improvements because it restores floodplain function at the same time that it reduces water surface elevation of floods. It provides groundwater benefits because it removes items that disconnect groundwater from the channel (such as the levee road). The project also includes a small feasibility assessment to look at ways to increase groundwater storage in the middle area of the Redwood Creek Watershed. The project improves habitat protection and restoration by providing extensive new winter habitat for coho and steelhead as well as 3 new ponds for California red-legged frog breeding. The project provides flood protection by eliminating a current problem in which Pacific Way is impassable for residents and visitors during average and moderate flood events. The project has already established a relationship with Native Americans particularly the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria. Since the site has multiple archeological sites plant species were used which correspond to the ethnographic record and were used historically by tribes. The tribe is currently in talks to develop a demonstration project to collect plants on the site for ethnographic uses. The tribe conducts an annual salmon blessing at a public event each year and participates in cultural resource monitoring. ","Detailed description: The overall project restores the natural function to the creek floodplain wetlands and dunes in the 46-acre area at the mouth of the Redwood Creek. The restoration is accomplished by removing features constructed in the 20th Century which confine the creek segregate it from its floodplain constrict flows and obstruct sediment transport. Specifically a 1300 levee road across the center of the floodplain will be removed a 500-LF visitor parking lot extending into the floodplain as a \"dam\" to restore the floodplain and the undersized 25-foot-long Pacific Way Bridge a county vehicular bridge will be replaced with a 250-LF vehicular bridge across the creek and its newly connected floodplain. Along with these primary actions numerous details are incorporated to provide enhanced winter habitat for federally and state endangered coho such as an off-channel pond backwaters and both large and small woody debris. About 240000 people visit the site each year so the modified visitor amenities must allow access while fully accommodating natural processes. A new 450-foot pedestrian bridge with long spans between piers will extend across the restored floodplain from the reconfigured floodplain. A new emergency access road was upgraded around the perimeter of the site with rock drain lenses to allow natural drainage patterns and a trail was rerouted in a subdrainage to better connect the micro-drainage with the creek and floodplain. When the natural processes function the flood elevations during average and moderate winter events are lower thereby reducing the threat to adjacent private property as well as access on the county road Pacific Way. The project is being implemented in 5 phases. IRWMP funding is requested for Phase 5 the last phase of the project. This entails the 1000 LF of channel realignment to its natural location that must be conducted at the same time that Marin County Dept. of Public Works constructs its new 250-LF vehicular bridge. The bridge cannot be constructed without constructing the new channel alignment under it at the same time. This request does not include a request for the bridge since Marin County is seeking other transportation-related funds for that purpose. This request is focused on the channel construction which will restore a alignment in the creek's natural topographic location and fully connect the creek with its floodplain both laterally and longitudinally. This phase of work also entails relocation of an AT&T utility box excavation of natural gravel from the old creek bed and abandonment of the old channel. About 12000 CY of material will be moved for this work. The phase 5 channel would be the upstream-most channel restoration in the project with its most upstream point at about 3200 LF upstream of the confluence with the ocean. Phases 1 through 3 of the project were completed from 2009 to 2011 and included realignment and restoration of the channel and new backwaters along the lower 2200 LF of the project area. The levee road was removed and a portion of the parking lot was removed and replaced with the first half of a 450-LF pedestrian bridge over the floodplain. Phase 4 is expected to be constructed in 2013 and will consist of reconfiguring the visitor parking lot to expand the full floodplain. The second leg of the new pedestrian bridge (an additional 225 LF) will also be constructed in Phase 4. Since the new channel and floodplain processes directly benefit coho salmon and since the coho population in Redwood Creek is the southern-most viable population of coho this project meets regional priorities identified by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the California Dept. of Fish and Game to enhance habitat for the California Central Coast Evoluntionarily Significant Unit. ","Project Need: The relocation of 1000 LF of channel in the upstream reach of the project area and under the new vehicular bridge is important for the following reasons: The action fulfills the overall project goal to remove constraints to natural creek and floodplain processes. The existing 25-foot-long Pacific Way Bridge is substantially undersized and causes flows and sediment transport to be obstructed. Flood flows therefore jump to the creek bank in average events that would otherwise be contained within the channel. The road therefore floods more frequently than it otherwise would and the likelihood of successful passage for fish on the floodplain - which is disconnected from the creek by the levee road - is doubtful. The creek in its existing location is geomorphologically unstable. It was historically located in the area proposed for its relocation. It has been held in place by prior management actions but it will always be trying to jump to the proposed restoration location. However without the new bridge that will never be possible. The full answer is to relocate the channel to its natural location and construct a bridge that will allow both routine and overbank flows to pass. The Phase 5 action for both the creek relocation combined with the partnership action to build the bridge is necessary to achieve the reduced flood elevations on adjacent private property and on the roadway during average and moderate winter events. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: High flows will be choked by the undersized Pacific Way Bridge. Sediment transport will be obstructed causing the upstream channel to fill more rapidly with sediment and reducing its conveyance capacity. Winter habitat for coho and steelhead in that reach of the creek will continue to have dysfunctional connections between the creek and floodplain. Management actions at the county bridge are likely to be needed. Residents of Muir Beach will continue to have periods during average and moderate winter of events where the road to their homes is unpassable. The downstream reaches of the channel restored in Phases 1 to 3 in 2009 to 2011 already provide significant flow and habitat benefits but they were designed and constructed for the long term downstream with the added conveyance capacity of the restored upstream reach. The area restored in the lower 2200 LF is subject to a function related to flows and sediment transport that is different than designed if the upper reach is not constructed. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) The project removes the constraints to natural groundwater dynamics with the channel and associated off-channel ponds and backwaters. A levee across the floodplain is removed and the channel is located at a natural location in the floodplain. Groundwater recharge will function naturally. An extensive network of groundwater wells has been installed at the site to document exactly how groundwater elevations function in relation to creek water surface elevations. Models projected that groundwater elevations would drop about 1 foot when the confining features (eg: the levee road and parking lot) were removed; data being collected is testing that theory. However please note that even a possible decline in groundwater elevations was considered for new plant communities. In many areas a surface layer of fill has been removed creating wetlands with better groundwater connection for native plants. A very minor component of the overall project includes a feasibility analysis to identify ways to increase groundwater storage about a mile upstream of the project area (in Franks Valley). The purpose of increased groundwater storage is to protect instream flows to benefit summer habitat for coho and steelhead. We would look at ways that drainages from the hillslopes could direct water to wetlands in the floodplain instead of draining directly into the channel in winter events. ii. Water Quality ...Water quality benefits of this project pertain primarily to turbidity and sediment loading. The project will allow more natural sediment transport dynamics as well as more natural areas for deposition on the floodplain which may benefit salmonids. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ...By removing the constraints to floodflows and reconnecting the floodplain hydraulic models have shown up to a 1 foot decrease in water surface elevations of overbank flows in the vicinity of private residences and a local private business near the new creek reach proposed for Phase 5 funding. In addition the local road Pacific Way would never be flooded since the bridge would span the 100-year event; therefore residents and visitors would never be stranded due to flooding on the road. In the pre-restoration condition stranding occurred on average about once per year due to flooding on the road. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) ... This project entails extensive resource stewardship management for volunteers and participation by school groups conservation groups neighborhood groups and others. So far we have clocked about 3000 hours of volunteer participation each year in this project. We grow about 30000 native plants each year in a watershed nursery. One nursery manager works with volunteers and interns throughout the year to collect these propagules of riparian and wetland species and grow them. A stewardship coordinator then manages volunteer work groups one to two times per week - or sometimes more - to plants these. Additional stewardship activities include detailed work to create suitable cover for coho while the riparian vegetation becomes reestablished and removing non-native weeds.

The recycled water provided by the Phase 1B Estuary Crossing may be used for irrigation industrial uses toilet flushing in commercial buildings and wetlands restoration. This project proposes to use recycled water to supply customers in the city of Alameda to restore wetlands along the Lake Merritt Channel in Oakland which would enhance the connection between Lake Merritt the channel and Oakland Estuary and improve aquatic habitat and enhance the park on the south side of the lake. ","Project Need: The EBRWP multi-phased project when completed will provide 2.5 mgd of recycled water includes a tertiary treatment plan transmission and distribution pipelines and customer retrofits. The first phase has been completed in the Oakland area that began recycled water deliveries in 2008 to portions of Oakland and Emeryville. The remainder of Phase 1A project in northern Emeryville Berkeley and Albany has not been completed and would provide 0.5 mgd. The proposed Phase 1B - Oakland will provide additional 1.2 mgd by expanding recycled water transmission and distribution systems. The proposed work includes adding about 3600 feet of 20-inch pipeline in Oakland and about 2300 feet of 16-inch pipeline to cross under the Oakland - Alameda Estuary to deliver recycled water to Alameda.

This project proposes to use recycled water for wetlands restoration along Lake Merritt Channel in Oakland whioch would enhance the connection between Lake Merritt the channel and Oakland Estuary and improve aquatic habitat and enhance the park on the south side of the lake while preserving the limited potable water supplies. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the proposed project is not implemented the EBRWP will not be oprated at the design capacity while wasting the limited drinking water. Benefits such as increasing regional reliance and flood control reducing drinking water supply restoring wetlands may not be fully realized while limtied drinking supply continued to be used for non-potable uses. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ii. Water Quality iii. Flood and Stormwater Management iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The funding will cover a portion of one of EBMUD's Integratate Recycled Water Management Project (IRWMP) components. The IRWMP will enhance EBMUD's ability to meet the needs of its 1.34 million business and residential customers by providing a reliable alternative recycled water supply that will conserve high quality potable water supplies. The projects that comprise the IRWMP will supply up to 8 mgd of highly purified recycled water to portions of EBMUD's extensive service area except the San Ramon Valley whis is already served by a recycled water porject which benefits from some federal funding. This project will help to offset demands for potable water by substituting recycled water for beneficial landscape commercial and industrial water uses currently served by EBMUD's supplies from the Mokelumne Reiver which is a tributary to the Delta. During dry and critically dry years the project will reduce EBMUD deversions from the Mokelumne and/or Sacramento Rivers. By increasing the proportion of recycled water used EBMUD will be able to save a larger percentage of its high quality potable water supplies for residential and commercial potable uses thereby increasing regional supply reliability. The project reduces wastewater discharges to San Francisco Bay by resuding wastewater that would otherwise be discharged to the San Francisco Bay from EBMUD's main wastewater treatment plant. The project will reduce the amount of water that must otherwise by delivered from the Mokelumne River to EBMUD's service area. Reducing deliveries can result in higher reservoir storage levels in EBMUD reservoirs in the Sierra Nevada foothills and increased reservoir releases to the lower Mokelumne River.

The project will to demonstrate how an LID retrofit project can directly improve water quality and also enhance neighborhood livability. ","('South Bay';) | Santa Clara "," ","TBD ","TBD "," ","Project Type Description: The project improves water quality and reduces flooding by constructing LID- based drainage improvements in alleys that are surfaced with deteriorating pavement and in places are unpaved and generate substantial dust and sediment. Since each of the alleys lack drainage infrastructure water floods them and adjacent yards and garages during storms. The project will resurface the alleys with permeable pavement and pavers that will drain to below-grade infiltration galleries. The project benefits a disadvantaged community since it is located within the larger Spartan-Keyes Strong Neighborhood Initiative area (SNI). The San Jos  City Council adopted the Strong Neighborhoods Initiative (SNI) Redevelopment Plan with the purpose of providing for the rehabilitation and redevelopment of blighted areas within the San Jose Redevelopment Project Area. The project site is located in a census tract with a Median Household Income (2009 American Community Survey) of $35427 which is less than 59% of the State Median Household Income ($60392). According to the Spartan-Keyes Neighborhood Improvement Plan Amendment (December 2008) the condition of alleyways in the Spartan Keyes SNI Area has been an ongoing concern of residents. ","Detailed description: The San Jos  Green Alley Demonstration Project will create durable cost-effective Low Impact Development drainage improvements in up to nine alleys in a disadvantaged community to demonstrate how LID strategies work in a retrofit project context. The subject alleys are spread throughout an older neighborhood of San Jos  where adjacent properties that lack BMPs drain to the alleys and buildings flanking the alleys prevent the use of surface stormwater treatment facilities. Because the alleys lack drainage improvments ponding during the wet season precludes their use by residents for either transportation or recreation and causes pavement to rapidly deteriorate. Poor surface conditions generate sediment and hinder street sweeping for pollutant control. Because the alleys aren't used by residents they are frequently used for illegal dumping. During the rainy season standing water mobilizes pollutants and either flows or is tracked onto adjoining streets where it mixes with less-polluted stormwater. The project will demonstrate how LID methods that maximize storm water infiltration on site can reduce the total runoff and associated pollutants from the alleys and make a useful neighborhood ammenity. The project will first evaluate the feasibility of replacing existing surfaces and constructing underground infiltration features in each of the nine alleys in the Spartan-Keys neighborhood just south of downtown San Jose. Based on 2010 census data most of Spartan-Keyes is a disadvantaged community. The City will construct at least one demonstration project at the most feasible alley to evaluate an existing conceptual design that installs permeable pavement in low-traffic areas recycled content high-albedo green concrete in high traffic areas and constructs underground infiltration galleries beneath the preamble areas to infiltrate water from the permeable areas. Water quality and quantity monitoring of both pre and post project conditions will quantify pollutant loading and identify the pollutant removal rates and flow reduction benefits of the specific green infrastructure improvements. The design of the first demonstration alley can be modified as necessary for subsequent ally retrofits to achieve an overall project goal of improving all alleys within the neighborhood where an LID retrofit is feasible. ","Project Need: The EPA's \"Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff\" identifies urban runoff pollutants as sediment oil grease from motor vehicles pesticides and nutrients from lawns and thermal pollution from dark surfaces. These pollutants can harm fish and wildlife kill native vegetation foul drinking water and make recreational areas unsafe and unpleasant. In their current condition neighborhood alleys are known sources of sediment and other urban pollutants to the Guadalupe River. Because the alleys lack drainage infrastructure ponding water has deteriorated the pavement exposing bare dirt that generates the sediment. The project will provide a durable surface in the alleys to eliminate sediment sources and will use infiltration to reduce polluted urban runoff and will use permeable pavers to infiltrate stormwater to prevent the transport of urban runoff pollutants. The EPA's \"Field Evaluation of Permeable Pavements for Stormwater Management\" found that the use of permeable pavement systems dramatically reduced surface runoff volumes by reducing the effective impervious area. Retrofit of the alleys with LID features will reduce runoff volumes and urban runoff pollutants loads and provide durable light colored surfaces to reduce heat island impacts and encourage beneficial use of the alleys. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The San Jose Green Alley project will reduce the quantity of urban runoff pollutants that enter the Guadalupe River from the local storm drain system by creating permanent permeable surfaces within the alleys that will absorb stormwater runoff. The alley's current lack of drainage infrastructure allows ponding which concentrates pollutants that are then carried by storm water flows and tracked by vehicles onto adjacent streets. Ponding also creates breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other pests. Sediment control is the primary strategy to address mercury and pesticide toxicity impairments in the Guadalupe River. Through the same mechanism the project will also curtail local thermal pollution and reduce the amount of oil gas diesel and PAHs that are transported to the Guadalupe River. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality The project will improve stormwater quality by reducing the overall volume of runoff from the alleys and by preventing the mobilization of urban pollutants through runoff. The project will eliminate sediment sources by replacing deteriorated asphalt in the alleys with a durable surface of high albedo \"green concrete\" that drains to below-grade infiltration devices. On-site infiltration facilities will be sized to retain and infiltrate 80% of the annual runoff from the alleys drainage area. Successful completion of the project will provide an example of how existing urban streets and alleys can be retrofitted with cost-efficient stormwater management features that provide long-term water quality benefits. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management The project will demonstrate how the LID practices of using permeable surfaces and on-site infiltration can be combined to retrofit a typical urban hardscape that lacks stormwater management infrastructure and has no space for above-ground stormwater features. Three functional stormwater management improvements will be provided: elimination of deteriorated sediment-generating asphalt and associated ponding and conveyance of runoff through a permeable surface to infiltration facilities and storage and infiltration of the water quality design storm through subsurface infiltration trenches and dry wells. The project will create durable low-maintenance improvements that provide long-term water quality benefits to alleys in an older neighborhood typical of Bay Area cities. iv.

"41 ","San Francisco Bay Livestock and Land Program ","The project utilizes an incentives based approach to achieve the cultural change needed for livestock facilities to voluntarily adopt management measures that improve the healthy functioning of watersheds. Specific implementation projects will be completed in high priority areas identified in watershed plans. Water quality goals will be achieved through implementation projects project design technical assistance and recruitment and training. ","('North Bay'; 'East Bay'; 'South Bay'; 'West Bay') | Alameda; Contra Costa; Solano; Napa; San Mateo; Santa Clara "," ","as early as 1/1/2013 ","24 months after start date ","The San Francisco Bay Area is indisputably an urbanized region but its urban areas are ringed with rural properties ranchlands and parks. This ring of less dense development provides a transition to the more intensive farming landscapes of the inland valleys. Despite the reduced density the rural properties grazing lands and livestock facilities in this transition zone contribute significantly to water quality impairments. The watersheds for the Napa River and its tributaries like Sonoma Creek support numerous grazing and livestock operations that have been identified as pollutant sources in the adopted sediment and pathogen TMDLs. The significance of these sources is confirmed in the recently adopted RWQCB 2 conditional waiver of waste discharge for grazing operations. In Contra Costa County Marsh Creek and Kellogg Creek are 303d listed for sediments pathogens and nutrients (Kellogg) with over 100 permitted equestrian facilities in those watersheds. Alameda Creek and San Francisquito Creek (San Mateo/Santa Clara) are 303d listed for sediments evidencing similar issues in the east and south bay area. Further a dozen watershed plans from around the bay identify equestrian and livestock operations as priorities in need of technical assistance. Due to the prevelance of program need six SF Bay Area Resource Conservation Districts will collaborate to promote programming deliver technical assistance identify specific priority implementation sites and design/implement BMPs on sites that will be come demonstration sites for the livestock community while protecting water quality in priority watersheds in Alameda Contra Costa Solano Napa San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties. ","Project Type Description: The project primarily protects water quality through the reduction of nutrient sediment and pathogens loads by reducing/eliminating the offsite transport of said pollutants from livestock facilities. Additionally the project offers groundwater benefits in that rainwater catchment is one of the installed BMPs that conserves groundwater and the proper management of manure reduces nitrate loading to shallow groundwater and infiltration sources. The implementation of bioswales and retention ponds increases the water quality and infiltration of stormwater runoff on livestock sites. ","Detailed description: Specific goals and objectives of this project include: Development of Implementation Sites   15 to 22 priority sites (an estimated 135 to 500 total acres) will be selected among livestock facility applicants to implement water quality BMP projects. Specific BMPs implemented and water quality improvements will vary based on site need and projects selected and will be designed by the Technical Advisory Committees (TAC) and consultants. These may include practice changes or infrastructure improvements. Example BMPs include: use of vegetative swales and buffer strips manure bunkers and other containment practices installation of gutters road and trail improvements reestablishment of vegetation and taking high use areas off line in winter. Implementation sites will achieve water quality protection and serve as classrooms training opportunities and a permanent local resource for the community. BMPs will be designed to meet NRCS service life standards. For each of the BMPs implemented we target to reduce the exposure of 80% of the manure and 50% of the highly erodible soil and to reduce overall potential loads by 30%. We propose to measure this pollutant reduction using the Load Modeling Tool Designing Projects that Perform - Livestock community will work with a local TAC to develop the scope for implementation of water quality BMPs. Through site visits landowners will have one-on-one interaction with local water quality experts including NRCS who can provide site assessment detailed recommendations and design assistance. Water Quality Site Planning - All program participants will receive training on how to identify water quality challenges on their sites and the assistance needed to complete a written site plan. Existing Livestock and Land site plan templates will be adapted if needed for each county in the project drawing from such existing models as the Ranch Water Quality Plan the NRCS Conservation Plan County Erosion Control Plans and the recommendations for site planning outlined in locally adopted TMDLs. All implementation project sites will be required to complete a site plan as part of their contract to receive funding for implementation projects. At least 15 implementation site owners and as many as 50 technical assistance recipients are anticipated to complete site plans during the course of this project. Recruitment & Technical Assistance Programs - Provide technical training series on BMP implementation that also provides an opportunity to recruit livestock owners to participate in implementation site projects. Peer Leaders can also be recruited to lead and foster a peer-to-peer network of information transfer. A target 185 livestock facility owners will receive 12 hours each of technical training on water quality protective BMPs and additional 240 will receive 6 hours of training. ","Project Need: The Napa River watershed supports numerous grazing and livestock operations that have been identified adopted sediment and pathogen TMDLs as pollutant sources additionally confirmed in the recently passed RWQCB 2 conditional waiver of waste discharge (grazing operations). Marsh Creek and Kellogg Creek in Contra Costa County are 303d listed for sediments pathogens and nutrients (Kellogg) with over 100 permitted equestrian facilities in those watersheds (see Map Page 2). Alameda and San Francisquito Creek s 303d listings evidence similar issues in the south bay area. Further a dozen watershed plans from around the bay identify equestrian and livestock operations as priorities for receiving technical assistance (see Maps page 4 for plans and listings). The problem of pollution from livestock operations is widespread and not easily solved. Barriers to managing livestock facilities in a way that are protective of water quality include: challenging site conditions historical co-locating of livestock near creeks and streams and lack of finances time and most importantly information about and peer support for protective site management practices. While NRCS can provide technical assistance and site improvement cost share for commodity-based operations via its EQUIP program the hobbyist rural property owner and equestrian facilities are unable to access these resources and thus generally remain unserved in terms of technical assistance site assessment awareness of available resources and lack of assistance in changing to a culture where BMPs are implemented as a norm. See the specific waterbodies and needs in the above question. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Without the cultural change in the Livestock community of the San Francisco Bay Area toward practices that are more protective of water quality the pollution issues identified in local watershed plans (as cited above) will continue to occur. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) While the primary justification for the project is surface water protection nitrate contamination compromises many shallow groundwater aquifers in the project area and several project target waterbodies supply drinking water reservoirs. The project will protect groundwater and surface drinking water by reducing nitrate leaching by reducing the exposure of manure to rainfall. This benefit is an important link in promoting social change as many owners of livestock facilities in these areas are also owners of private drinking water wells. ii. Water Quality The proposed project utilizes a Community-Based Social Marketing approach to achieve the cultural change needed for livestock facilities to voluntarily adopt management measures that are protective of water quality now and into the future. Through technical and hands-on trainings livestock owners and managers will gain a specific understanding of how their operations contribute to sediment nutrient and pathogen pollution to surface and ground waters. They will be assisted through the process of identifying solutions and planning for improved property management practices including completing a written site plan which will guide practices in the long run. The construction of implementation sites will not only deliver immediate and lasting gains toward meeting water quality standards but also further the understanding of BMP efficacy on livestock sites. These sites will also serve the community as on the ground examples of BMPs in action and serve as classrooms training opportunities and permanent local resources for the community. This project is designed to be a source reduction and pollution prevention program. For example we will both reduce the sources of and the transport of sediment off livestock facility sites. While we cannot reduce the volume of manure which is the source of nutrient and pathogen pollution targeted we will reduce the volume of manure exposed to the elements and vulnerable to mobilization. We will also reduce the transport of those pollutants off site. These reductions will be achieved via proper storage and management and drainage improvements on livestock facility sites. This strategy will be applied within all site assessment planning and BMP recommendations as well as promoted in trainings and via Peer Leader outreach efforts to create a pollution prevention culture among all livestock facility participants and in turn the larger community of livestock owners and borders Our objective is to implement priority BMPS on at least 12 livestock facility Implementation Sites. We also target documenting as many as 106 additional BMPs implemented by technical training participants. For each of the BMPs implemented we target to reduce the exposure of 80% of the manure and 50% of the highly erodible soil and to reduce overall potential loads by 30%. We propose to measure this pollutant reduction using the Livestock and Land Load Reduction Modeling Tool. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) A key challenge on West Coast livestock facility sites is  dust in summer mud in winter . When we reduce this source of sediment pollution from livestock impact areas and dirt roads through implementation of BMPs we also decrease the dust problem a localized air quality concern in livestock facility neighborhoods during the dry season.

"42 ","2020 Turf Replacement Project ","This project will replace up to 1 million square feet of non-functional turf grass in MMWD s commercial institutional and industrial (CII) properties with environmentally beneficial landscapes. Project benefits include a reduction of 25.6 million gallons of potable water use each year drought resiliency significant reductions in non-point-source pollution green waste to landfills and greenhouse gases generated by lawn maintenance equipment. Habitat enhancements include the addition of 1 million square feet of native and climate appropriate urban landscape that conserves water reduces impacts to wetland areas and greenhouse gases and recycles green waste on site. ","('North Bay';) | Marin ","38.0400 | -122.7400 ","10/01/2015 ","06/30/2019 ","Commercial institutional and industrial (CII) turf areas throughout the Marin Municipal Water District service area located in Marin County. ","Project Type Description: Water supply reliability will be enhanced by permanently reducing CII landscape irrigation demand by 6%. Water quality and habitat protection and restoration efforts will benefit by eliminating dry-weather runoff from 23 acres of turf caused by irrigation systems that carry pollutants into downstream wetland habitats. ","Detailed description: The north San Francisco bay region is home to endangered and threatened salmonids amphibians and plant species directly impacted by the availability of fresh water flows in Marin and Sonoma County watersheds. From a potable water supply perspective turf grass consumes more water than any other landscape plant species and accounts for a significant peak in water demand during months when rainfall is unable to meet plant demand. In addition to the quantity of fresh water water quality in wetland habitat areas is impacted by dry weather urban runoff containing biological and chemical contaminants detrimental to sensitive species. Much of this dry weather inflow to habitats occurs as a direct result of landscape irrigation system runoff especially from irrigated turf areas predominantly using overhead spray and rotor-type sprinkler technology. Although well managed turf grass used in active recreational areas for example can be very functional and have environmental and social benefits non-functional turf grass areas do not typically provide the same level of benefit. The total area of non-functional commercial turf in MMWD is 80 acres: This project will replace 29% of that area with climate appropriate landscaping that enhances the urban watershed and significantly reduces potable water consumption and pollution caused by irrigation runoff. Project implementation will consist of a rebate program that offers CII customers a $2 per square foot incentive to replace non-functional turf grass with beneficial low water demand landscaping. Eligible items will include native and climate appropriate plants drip irrigation system equipment organic soil amendments and other required materials to install an environmentally sustainable landscape. MMWD staff will administer all elements of the project including code compliance technical support marketing site inspections quality control accounting and grant administration and reporting. MMWD is a partner in the sub-regional Sonoma-Marin Water Saving Partnership along with nine other north bay water agencies (Partnership). The Partnership has established joint water conservation goals in order to comply with SBx7-7 legislation that established mandatory gallons per capita reductions by 2020. The water savings achieved by this project will assist every agency in the Partnership by reducing the total gallons per capita used in this sub-region by 2020. MMWD actively participates in numerous collaborative efforts supporting natural resources management partnering with local and regional entities to accomplish important projects supporting watershed stewardship endangered species protection and restoration vegetation management water conservation and education. The district is a partner in the Tamalpais Lands Collaborative and also partners with local and regional entities such as the National Park Service California Department of Fish and Wildlife California State Parks the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board National Fish and Wildlife Foundation the County of Marin Marin County Resource Conservation District and a host of other government and non-profit entities to support and implement priority natural resource projects and initiatives. Disadvantaged Community: This project does not provide benefits specifically targeting or in support of a DAC; the project will benefit the entire MMWD service area in Marin County California and the Bay Area region in general. Project Scalability The scope of this project and the grant request amount are scalable. Total estimated costs to implement the project at proposed scale is $2.2 million. This proposal requests $1.4 million and will accomplish $2.2 million in work. By adding or reducing 100000 square feet of turf area the proposed grant request and cost share can be scaled upwards to $2.4 million or downwards to $2.1 million. ","Project Need: MMWD collects 75% of its potable water supply from rainfall on the Mt. Tamalpais watershed and 25% is imported from the Russian River watershed in Sonoma county. Both of these hydrologic regions depend entirely on local rainfall for potable water supplies have very limited water storage capacity and are required by law to release significant portions of this water to support ecosystems that are home to multiple species of listed endangered and critically endangered species. This project will conserve 25.6 million gallons of potable water each year 6% of all potable water now used to irrigate CII landscapes. This project will provide drought resiliency for MMWD by conserving 25.6 million gallons of potable water annually. Commercial customers will receive financial incentives and technical assistance to convert non-functional turf areas into habitat and climate appropriate landscape areas following the principles of low impact design and Bay-Friendly landscaping. Landscapes created and maintained using these principles typically reduce potable water demand by at least 50% compared to turf grass. Regional priorities addressed by this project include: Reinforce/enhance water supply capacity  as this project will conserve 25.6 million gallons of potable water annually effectively adding to MMWD and the region s potable water supply. Health of the Bay and creeks  as this project will contribute to maintaining watershed vegetation land cover and minimize non-point source pollution resulting from urban runoff containing biological and chemical contaminants detrimental to sensitive species. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: California is currently experiencing extreme drought conditions and actions must be taken to conserve precious water supplies wherever and whenever possible. If this project is not implemented an opportunity will be lost to save a minimum of 79 AF annually and permanently and replace 23 acres of non-functional urban landscape with beneficial plant species. MMWD has only 2 years of water storage capacity including 1 year of mandatory drought rationing with only one supplemental supply pipeline from the Russian River watershed to the north. One third of water supply is released from MMWD reservoirs to support downstream fisheries and wetland habitats. During the next extended drought event every gallon of water will be critical to assure water availability to people and sensitive habitats. If this proposal is not implemented a significant opportunity to eliminate non-essential water use and enhance local ecosystems will be lost. Project monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by MMWD staff utilizing Automatic Meter Reading technology advanced water use tracking software and site inspections to verify that sites are following best practices for maintenance and are achieving water savings based on water budgets calculated for each site. As noted above regional priorities addressed by this project include: Reinforce/enhance water supply capacity as this project will conserve 25.6 million gallons of potable water annually effectively adding to MMWD and the region s potable water supply. Health of the Bay and creeks as this project will contribute to maintaining watershed vegetation land cover and minimize non-point source pollution resulting from urban runoff containing biological and chemical contaminants detrimental to sensitive species. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) This project will permanently reduce potable water demand by more than 25 million gallons per year. Benefits will accrue at a rate of 14.5 gallons per square foot converted to drip irrigation per year. ii. Water Quality Water quality impairments will be mitigated by reducing dry weather inflows of the nutrient laden non-point-source pollution into the MS4 storm drain systems that dump into downstream wetlands. Approximately 5% of water applied to commercial turf grass areas is estimated to runoff into MS4 storm drains as a result of overwatering equipment breaks and pipe leaks. This equates to more than 1.5 million gallons of water each year from the project area. Water quality benefits will accrue at a rate of 1.5 gallons per square foot converted to drip irrigation per year. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) Urban watersheds and habitat will benefit from the installation of native and climate adapted plant species that provide cover and food for pollinator and bird species. Downstream wetland habitats will benefit from reduced loads of chemical nutrients and pesticides used for turf grass maintenance. The quantity of chemical reduction will be proportional to the Benefit/Cost Ratio Water Conservation elements related to this project are included in Propositions 50 and 84 IRWM Implementation Grants for the Bay Area region. The Bay Area s Proposition 84 Round 2 IRWM Implementation Grant includes the  Bay Area Regional Conservation and Education Program . A rigorous benefit/cost analysis was conducted during the proposal development process which resulted in establishing a benefit/cost ratio of 1.70 for this project. As the turf replacement work included with this current concept proposal differs from this Regional Program in that this project consists primarily of implementation which will therefore result in higher expected water savings per dollar spent it is reasonable to assume the work proposed here would achieve a higher than 2.0 benefit/cost ratio. Integration This project presents a high degree of up-front integration as it addresses priorities associated with several Functional Areas including Water Supply/Water Quality and Watershed/Habitat. As described above the project will contribute measurably to water supply reliability water quality improvement watershed habitat creation and restoration as well reductions in greenhouse gases generated by turf maintenance equipment and vehicle miles required to dispose of green waste.

The project will completely eliminate flooding through the 100-year fluvial event coincident with the 100-year high tide taking into account a potential 26-inch rise in sea level over the next 50 years. As such the project will provide a significant water quality benefit by preventing transport of debris and contaminants from urbanized areas to the San Francisquito Creek during flooding events. The project will create increased tidal marshland habitat (within new channel) at appropriate elevations for intertidal wetland plant and animal species. The project is expected to create approximately 16.1 acres of new or improved Mid-Marsh habitat and an estimated 4.0 acres of new or improved Low-Marsh habitat. Another benefit will be the restoration of high tide refugial habitat for sensitive wildlife species at the ecotone between tidal wetland and upland habitats. The project will protect more than 1100 properties from creek flooding and when coupled with future tidal levee improvements will remove these properties from the FEMA floodplain. The downstream reach of San Francisquito Creek between East Bayshore Road and San Francisco Bay is at the highest risk of severe flooding in the system due to undersized channel capacity and sub-standard levees. Flooding risk is exacerbated during high tides. The creek in this area runs through communities that have experienced severe damage during previous flood events which includes the Disadvantaged Community of East Palo Alto. ","Detailed description: Following years of effort to address environmental issues and a 45-year flood in 1998 that damaged approximately 1700 properties five local agencies from two counties the cities of Palo Alto Menlo Park and East Palo Alto the County of San Mateo and the Santa Clara Valley Water District joined together to create a new regional government agency the San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority (SFCJPA). The Authority s multi-jurisdictional approach to solving problems is reflected in this project; which serves to address the interrelated water quality habitat protection and restoration and flood protection needs of the region. The goal of San Francisquito Creek Flood Protection and Ecosystem Restoration Capital Improvement Project East Bayshore Road to San Francisco Bay (Project) is to provide protection against a 1% fluvial event coincident with a 1% tide with accommodation for 26 inches of projected sea level rise and FEMA freeboard requirements on San Fransciquito Creek between East Bayshore Road and the San Francisco Bay. The project will protect more than 1100 properties from creek flooding and when coupled with future tidal levee improvements will remove these properties from the FEMA floodplain. The downstream reach of San Francisquito Creek between East Bayshore Road and San Francisco Bay is at the highest risk of severe flooding in the system due to undersized channel capacity and sub-standard levees. Flooding risk is exacerbated during high tides. The creek in this area runs through communities that have experienced severe damage during previous flood events. The completion of the East Bayshore Road to San Francisco Bay reach is a necessary first step to provide comprehensive flood protection farther upstream. The Project will remove fluvial flooding risks from San Francisquito Creek for over 1000 properties (primary residences) within the City of East Palo Alto. The Median Household Income in East Palo Alto is $44000 annually which is approximately 58% of the Median Household Income (MHI) for the State of California qualifying East Palo Alto as a Disadvantaged Community (DAC) as defined by the California Department of Finance Population Research Unit. The Project would increase stream flow capacity in San Francisquito Creek from the downstream face of East Bayshore Road to San Francisco Bay. It would reduce local flood risks during storm events as well as provide the capacity needed for upstream flood protection projects being planned by the San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority (SFCSFCJPA). Increasing the Creek s flow capacity from San Francisco Bay to Highway 101 would be achieved by widening the Creek channel within the reach to convey peak flows for 100-year storm events removing abandoned PG&E pipelines and configuring flood walls in the upper part of the reach for consistency with structure for Caltrans  enlargement of the Highway 101/East Bayshore Road Bridge over San Francisquito Creek. Project elements include flood walls levee setbacks and creek widening in the middle reach between East Palo Alto and the Palo Alto Municipal Golf Course. The Project addresses ecosystem restoration flood management recreation and public access wetland enhancement and watershed planning. ","Project Need: Climate Change: This project will improve marshland resiliency through improved sediment transport enhancing shoreline sustainability. By reducing fluvial aggregation and providing a source of sediment to build up high-marsh the result will be an enhanced marshland resilience which will combat rising sea levels. Health of the Bay and Creeks: The project will create increased tidal marshland habitat (within new channel) at appropriate elevations for intertidal wetland plant and animal species. The project is expected to create approximately 16.1 acres of new or improved Mid-Marsh habitat and an estimated 4.0 acres of new or improved Low-Marsh habitat. The conversion of low quality floodplain terrace habitat to higher quality marshplain habitat dominated by native tidal salt and brackish marsh species is the key element to the restoration goals of the project. This will be accomplished by increasing the tidal prism thereby increasing the summertime salinities in the project reach and via the excavation of new marshplains to elevations that will facilitate colonization by tidal salt marsh plant species and deter colonization by ruderal species. Another benefit will be the restoration of high tide refugial habitat for sensitive wildlife species at the ecotone between tidal wetland and upland habitats. This will be accomplished via a combination of grading (e.g. levee lowering and grading of stable inboard levee slopes) topsoil preparation and active revegetation. Invasive Species Management: The conversion of low quality floodplain terrace habitat (dominated by non-native perennial pepperweed) to higher quality marshplain habitat dominated by native tidal salt and brackish marsh species is the key element to the restoration goals of the project. This will be accomplished by increasing the tidal prism thereby increasing the summertime salinities in the project reach and via the excavation of new marshplains to elevations that will facilitate colonization by tidal salt marsh plant species and deter colonization by ruderal species (e.g. perennial pepperweed). Sediment Management: The new channel design is expected to result in reduced sedimentation throughout the reach which will generate a reduction in suspended solids within the reach resulting in enhanced in-stream water quality. The project will protect surface water quality by completely eliminate flooding through the 100-year fluvial event coincident with the 100-year high tide taking into account a potential 26-inch rise in sea level over the next 50 years. As such the project will provide a significant water quality benefit by preventing transport of debris and contaminants from urbanized areas to the San Francisquito Creek during flooding events. In addition sediment transport will be improved throughout the project reach reducing fluvial aggregation and providing a source of sediment to build up high-marsh. The result will be an enhanced marshland resilience which will combat rising sea levels. Riparian and Fisheries Restoration: San Francisquito Creek is unique because it remains one of the only San Francisco Bay streams that is not confined to a concrete channel. As a result San Francisquito Creek largely retains its natural character despite its urban setting and is home to many rare and threatened native species including steelhead trout. The project will result in lower velocity flows during migration season improving the conditions for the native Steelhead species. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Residential Flood Damage Assumptions without Project It is estimated that approximately 703 homes 914 homes and 1090 homes would be inundated in the 25-year 50-year and 100-year flood respectively. In 2011 the total residential damages including damages to structures and content was estimated to be $18655865 $24255278 and $28925879 for the 25- 50- and 100-year flood events respectively. Data related to cleanup and debris removal costs are not available and have therefore been excluded from this analysis. The majority of residences impacted by this project are located in East Palo Alto a DAC. Commercial Flood Damage Assumptions without Project In 2011 it was estimated that approximately 8 office buildings 14 office buildings and public facilities and 18 office buildings and public facilities would be affected in the 25-year 50-year and 100-year events respectively. In summary the total commercial damages including damages to structures and content is estimated to be $1216000 $2128000 and $2736000 for the 25- 50- and 100-year flood events respectively. Road Inundation Damage Assumptions without Project Costs associated with road inundation were estimated using the default values within the Department of Water Resources  Flood Rapid Assessment Model. These default values assume the cost per mile of highway / arterial major minor and unsealed roads to be $250000 $100000 $30000 and $10000 respectively. These assumptions are based on estimates developed for the San Francisco Bay Area. The inundation areas identified in the project area are also located within the San Francisco Bay Area. As such it was determined that these values reasonably reflect the costs associated with road inundation in the project area. In total these costs sum to $250000 $330000 and $475000 for the 25-year 50-year and 100-yaer floods respectively. Description of Without-Project Conditions Under existing conditions tidal marshland habitat and pickleweed habitat are present but are limited to small spatial in-channel elevations due to accumulated fluvial sediments within the leveed channel throughout the project reach. The ideal elevation for these habitats is at mean higher high water or a range between the average daily high tides. The channel also serves as a migratory corridor for adult and smolt steelhead. The narrow channel and resulting high velocities limit the opportunity for adult steelhead to pass upstream to spawning areas in the upper watershed during high flow events the very events that provide for passage upstream of the project reach. ","Project Benefits: Project Beneficiaries and Distribution of Benefits This Project will benefit stakeholders at the local and regional levels. This Project benefits local residents by virtually eliminating the risk of levee overtopping in storm events up to and including the 100-year flood coincident with the 100-year high tide. In addition this Project will benefit regional stakeholders by eliminating the risk of flooding to Highway 101. This Project will provide appreciable statewide benefits by preventing water quality impacts to the San Francisco Bay resulting from flooding. It is estimated that approximately 703 homes 914 homes and 1090 homes would be protected from the 25-year 50-year and 100-year flood respectively. It is estimated that approximately 8 office buildings 14 office buildings and public facilities and 18 office buildings and public facilities would be protected from the 25-year 50-year and 100-year events respectively. Flood Damage Reduction Costs and Benefits The Project would increase stream flow capacity in San Francisquito Creek from the downstream face of East Bayshore Road to San Francisco Bay. It would reduce local flood risks during storm events as well as provide the capacity needed for upstream flood protection projects being planned by the San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority (SFCSFCJPA). Increasing the Creek s flow capacity from San Francisco Bay to Highway 101 would be achieved by widening the Creek channel within the reach to convey peak flows for 100-year storm events removing abandoned PG&E pipelines and configuring flood walls in the upper part of the reach for consistency with structure for Caltrans  enlargement of the Highway 101/East Bayshore Road Bridge over San Francisquito Creek. Project elements include flood walls levee setbacks and creek widening in the middle reach between East Palo Alto and the Palo Alto Municipal Golf Course. Levee Failure Assumptions With Project The Project has been designed to prevent flooding in a 100-year fluvial event that coincides with the 100-year high tide taking into account a potential 26-inch rise in sea level over the next 50 years. As such there is zero probability of overtopping during a 25- year 50-year or 100-year event. Description of Expected Water Quality and Other Benefits with Project The Project will generate significant water quality and ecosystem benefits including reduced sedimentation creation of new habitat for sensitive species and improved recreational opportunities. These benefits are described in further detail below. Water Quality Benefits Water quality benefits attributable to the Project include enhanced in-stream water quality and surface water quality protection. These benefits are described in the following paragraphs. Enhanced In-Stream Water Quality The new channel design is expected to result in reduced sedimentation throughout the reach which will generate a reduction in suspended solids within the reach. The magnitude of this benefit is currently unclear; as such this benefit has not been monetized. Surface Water Quality Protection Implementation of this Project will reduce flood-related debris and pollutant loading in San Francisquito Creek and the San Francisco Bay. Currently flood waters leaving the creek channel pass through urbanized areas where they are likely to become degraded and contaminated with debris as well as water quality parameters including bacteria nutrients floating material mercury oil and grease pesticides salinity sediment settleable material suspended material. The O Connor Pump Station forebay is located within the inundation area. During flood events water in this forebay receives increased loading of a variety of contaminants. The O Connor Pump Station pumps water from the forebay back to San Francisquito Creek. As such the debris and contaminants introduced into the flood waters as they flow through an urbanized area are then returned to San Francisquito Creek where they may degrade creek water quality and pose a threat to aquatic species and sensitive habitats. The Project will completely eliminate flooding through the 100-year fluvial event coincident with the 100-year high tide taking into account a potential 26-inch rise in sea level over the next 50 years. As such the Project will provide a significant water quality benefit by preventing transport of debris and contaminants from urbanized areas to the San Francisquito Creek during flooding events. Further the Project will provide water quality protection for the San Francisco Bay. According to Volume II of the Final Report on San Francisquito Creek Hydraulic Modeling and Floodplain Mapping (Floodplain Modeling and Mapping) which was prepared for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in January of 2010 during the 250- and 500-year flood events significant volumes of flood waters leave the floodplain and are discharged to San Francisco Bay (385 acre-feet and 974 acre-feet respectively). As described previously these flood waters flow through urbanized areas where they are likely to become degraded and contaminated with debris as well as water quality contaminants such as bacteria nutrients floating material mercury oil and grease pesticides salinity sediment settleable material suspended material. Although the Project is not designed to the 250- or 500-year storm it is conservatively designed for the 100-year event. Even if overtopping does occur during these events the quantity of water leaving the channel is expected to be significantly less than under the without Project condition and it is possible that the floodwaters may be contained within the floodplain. As a result the Project is expected to reduce pollutant loading   including mercury copper and other constituents of particular concern - to the San Francisco Bay during major flood events. Other Benefits In addition to improving water quality in San Francisquito Creek by reducing sedimentation the Project will provide important ecologic and recreational benefits as described below. Habitat Creation and Restoration The Project will create increased tidal marshland habitat (within new channel) at appropriate elevations for intertidal wetland plant and animal species. The Project is expected to create approximately 16.1 acres of new or improved Mid-Marsh habitat and an estimated 4.0 acres of new or improved Low-Marsh habitat. The conversion of low quality floodplain terrace habitat (dominated by non-native perennial pepperweed) to higher quality marshplain habitat dominated by native tidal salt and brackish marsh species is the key element to the restoration goals of the Project. This will be accomplished by increasing the tidal prism thereby increasing the summertime salinities and via the excavation of new marshplains to elevations that will facilitate colonization by tidal salt marsh plant species and deter colonization by ruderal species (e.g. perennial pepperweed). Another benefit will be the restoration of high tide refugial habitat for sensitive wildlife species at the ecotone between tidal wetland and upland habitats. This will be accomplished via a combination of grading (e.g. levee lowering and grading of stable inboard levee slopes) topsoil preparation and active revegetation. It is difficult to assign a value for habitat creation and restoration. The San Francisco Bay area is home to 500 species of wildlife 128 of them threatened or endangered like the California clapper rail and salt marsh harvest mouse. The Bay is a crucial resting spot for millions of migrating birds and its sheltered waters provide critical nurseries for fish. (www.savesfbay.org/greening-bay). Estuary wetlands sustain over 60 plant and animal species that are listed as rare threatened or endangered or are candidates for such listing. Of the animal species the California clapper rail California least tern and salt marsh harvest mouse are best known due to their presence on several bayshore properties proposed for development; this Project would provide suitable habitat for the salt marsh harvest mouse and the California clapper rail. A well-regarded technique for assigning value to habitat for wetlands is Willingness to Pay. A 2009 report prepared by EPA entitled The Economic Value of Coastal Ecosystems in California (Raheem et al 2009) summarizes ecosystem service values found by surveying available willingness-to-pay information and studies worldwide. This summary presents ecosystem service values for individual ecosystem functions (where available) as well as for bundled services (assumed aggregate value) for estuarine and beach environments. The range of values for estuarine environments was found to range from $50000 - $80000 per acre per year and beaches range from $36000 - $83000 per acre (2008 USD). Specific values for marsh habitat were not provided. Based on these data points the value of the wetlands created and restored by this Project is conservatively estimated at $50000 per acre per year (2009 USD). This translates to an ecosystem services benefit of $1005000per year with project implementation or approximately $14227936 over the 50-year project life. Enhanced Recreational Opportunities The Project will replace the without-project pedestrian and bicycle trails along the length of the levees to be replaced or modified but the new levees will accommodate higher traffic due to increased width (16ft) along the crown of the levees. Additional width of the paved or gravel trails will be created at strategic locations to provide pull out points for pedestrians or bicyclists to let maintenance vehicles travelling along the levee to pass. Benches and interpretive panels will be placed at the footing of the existing Friendship Bridge on the East Palo Alto side on the new  island  created at the existing south footing of the Friendship Bridge and on the new levee on the Palo Alto side. Information related to current use of existing recreational facilities is limited; as a result the economic value of enhanced recreational opportunities cannot be quantified. Enhanced Public Health Protection In addition to providing water quality habitat and recreation benefits this Project will improve public health protection by eliminating exposure to degraded flood waters. Currently this disadvantaged community experiences periodic severe flooding. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) there is an increased risk of infection of waterborne diseases when direct contact occurs with polluted flood waters through wound infections dermatitis conjunctivitis and ear nose and throat infections. One epidemic-forming disease that may be contracted from body contact with flood waters is leptospirosis a bacterial disease. Leptospirosis may be transmitted through contact of the skin or mucous membranes with contaminated water damp soil or vegetation or mud contaminated with rodent urine. Flooding following rainfall assists in spreading the organism due to the proliferation of rodents which shed large amounts of leptospires in their urine. Leptospirosis outbreaks have occurred throughout the world with a recent (2007) outbreak on a college campus in Oahu HI following a flood event. Even accidental ingestion of flood waters or of water contaminated with flood waters can cause a host of infections ranging from mild to severe. A well-known example of disease outbreak following drinking water contamination occurred in Walkerton Ontario in 2000 in which seven people died after consuming drinking water contaminated with E. coli. In 1999 a dormitory sewage pit on County Fairgrounds in New York caused a major outbreak of waterborne disease killing two people and hospitalizing 71 others. The risk of infection posed by contacting and / or ingesting flood waters is severe. By protecting this disadvantaged community from floods up to the 100-year event this Project will remove the real and immediate public health risks posed by exposure to degraded flood water quality. Reduced Road Maintenance Requirements As floodwaters recede a significant volume is left behind in temporary ponds. The Project will reduce ponding on streets and minimize the effect of moisture in creating potholes and cracks which make up a significant portion of street maintenance costs.

This project leverages the power of Bay Area city and county governments to accelerate the transformation from conventional to sustainable landscaping practices. As with existing water-efficient landscape efforts undertaken by the region s water agencies this project aims to significantly decrease the use of the Bay Area s drinking water supply for landscape irrigation. However this project s holistic approach to landscape design and management   based on the comprehensive Bay-Friendly Landscape standard   will provide a broader and more enduring range of benefits than current programs focused solely on decreasing water use. These additional benefits include: - Improving water quality by reducing or eliminating the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers reducing runoff and improving the health of soil and its ability to break down and filter contaminants. - Improving stormwater management with a comprehensive set of landscape best practices that reduce runoff and keep stormwater onsite. Bay-Friendly Landscape s rigorous standards are designated as Best Management Practices in the Regional Water Quality Control Board s Municipal Regional Stormwater NPDES Permit since 2009. - Providing groundwater benefits by improving infiltration of stormwater into the soil and reducing or eliminating the use of pesticides and other contaminants. - Increasing infiltration by encouraging strategies such as increased organic matter content in soil permeable paving bioswales rain gardens and other low impact development (LID) features. - Protecting habitat by encouraging the use of a diverse palette of native plant species avoiding the introduction of invasive horticultural species and reducing the contamination of habitat with pesticides and other pollutants. - Providing flood protection by emphasizing LID strategies to reduce runoff and increase infiltration of stormwater. ","Detailed description: General Project Concept As California s prolonged drought continues and the impacts of climate change on our water resources become more apparent the Bay Area s water agencies are making extraordinary efforts to reduce water demand. Clearly however they cannot win this battle on their own. To complement and build on these conservation programs the Accelerating Sustainable Landscape Adoption project will harness the power of Bay Area city and county governments to create fundamental change in how public and private sector landscapes are designed built and managed. This project will be led by StopWaste a public agency responsible for reducing waste in Alameda County. Over the past 10 years StopWaste has worked with its 14 member cities and the county to adopt Bay-Friendly landscape policies that make urban landscapes more resilient to drought and climate change and better able to capture hold and filter stormwater. As part of this work StopWaste created the Bay-Friendly Landscape Guidelines the Bay-Friendly Landscape Rating System and other resources now managed by the regional nonprofit Bay-Friendly Landscaping & Gardening Coalition. (Attachment 3 provides more information about these and other Bay-Friendly resources and highlights results from more than 10 years of implementing Bay-Friendly policies and practices in Alameda County.) This project will leverage these tools and strategies to accelerate a regional transformation from water-greedy lawn-centric landscapes to California-friendly landscapes that naturally thrive in a summer-dry drought-prone climate. What Will Be Implemented The project s main focus is to leverage change where local governments have the greatest influence on landscape practices: the public properties they own and maintain and the new landscape projects they issue permits for. Individually few local governments have the resources or expertise to envision and enact landscape policies that provide a comprehensive approach to drought and climate resilience. To address this need this project will convene a public agency landscape council that will serve as a forum for local governments to coordinate efforts pool resources and replicate successes. This project will also provide technical assistance to local governments to help them adopt implement and enforce regionally consistent policies that meet the comprehensive Bay-Friendly standard. These activities will send a clear signal to the landscape industry that investments in staff training and new business practices will be rewarded with greater demand for Bay-Friendly landscape services. To complement the public sector activities this project will expand the Bay-Friendly Qualified Professional training program to include courses in marketing sustainable landscape services as well as specialized training in the design construction and management of LID stormwater systems. This project will also provide incentives to high profile commercial properties in the region to convert their conventional landscapes to sustainable Bay-Friendly landscapes. As local governments and businesses implement sustainable landscape practices on highly visible public properties such as parks civic centers street medians and office parks homeowners take notice and are more likely to make similar changes to their properties. This project will amplify this ripple effect by providing how-to education to homeowners via workshops videos and other outreach. How the Project Will Function StopWaste will administer the DWR grant and partner with the Bay-Friendly Coalition to convene the regional public agency council and establish mechanisms for delivering technical assistance and policy support to local governments throughout the Bay Area IRWM region. In preliminary discussions with StopWaste a number of cities counties and other local government entities have expressed strong interest in this project concept. The project s training and outreach activities will be managed by the Bay-Friendly Coalition which currently offers landscape professional training and homeowner education funded in part by Prop. 84. Regional Coordination The paradigm for this project   that local governments can work together to accelerate a regional shift to more sustainable and water-efficient landscape practices   has precedent in the Bay Area s building sector. In the early 2000s StopWaste helped launch a nonprofit organization Build It Green (BIG). One of BIG s core activities was to convene a Green Building Public Agency Council to provide policy and technical support to local governments. At the outset of this process only one city in the Bay Area had a green building policy. By 2010 most cities and counties had green building requirements local governments were leading by example by making civic buildings greener and more energy efficient and the region s public agencies and building professionals were well ahead of the curve when CALGreen the statewide mandatory green building code went into effect in 2011. Gov. Brown s April 1 2015 Executive Order directs the Department of Water Resources to update the state Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance (WELO) to increase water efficiency and promote compliance. Leveraging the region s proven model for shifting the building sector toward greater sustainability this project will position Bay Area cities and counties to be leaders in the WELO update process and to help steer the region s residential and commercial property owners to more sustainable and water-efficient practices. DAC Benefits As a result of this project public parks street medians and other public properties will be renovated and managed according to Bay-Friendly principles that lead to safer healthier more beautiful neighborhoods providing a direct benefit to Disadvantaged Communities. ","Project Need: California s historic drought and the unprecedented statewide mandatory water reductions recently announced are focusing greater attention on the potential impacts of climate change on the Bay Area s water resources. These include more variable weather and precipitation patterns including longer and more severe droughts and more intense downpours that may exacerbate flood risks. In addition experts project loss of at least 25% of the Sierra snowpack by 2050 meaning less water will be available to use. (Source: Department of Water Resources www.water.ca.gov/climatechange.) The Accelerating Sustainable Landscape Adoption project will address these challenges by accelerating the transition from conventional to Bay-Friendly landscape design construction and maintenance practices throughout the BAIRWM region. The Bay-Friendly approach to landscaping goes beyond drought tolerance. It emphasizes ecologically and economically sound practices that make urban landscapes more adaptive and resilient in the face of a rapidly changing climate. Water supply need: This project will increase local governments  adoption of policies based on comprehensive sustainable landscape practices such as the Bay-Friendly Landscape standard. The Bay-Friendly approach has been shown to reduce irrigation water use by 50% to 90% compared to conventional landscaping. It does this holistically by addressing the total landscape starting with the soil which is often overlooked by water efficiency programs but is critical to long-term water conservation and many other benefits. The Bay-Friendly approach ensures that compost and mulch are used to increase the soil s organic matter content to at least 3.5% and preferably 5%. Organic matter acts like a sponge holding water in the root zone longer decreasing loss to evaporation increasing infiltration improving plant health and breaking down pollutants. The holistic Bay-Friendly approach also includes installing low water using plants avoiding overplanting and designing and installing efficient irrigation systems. Water quality need: The Bay-Friendly standards promoted by this project improve water quality in the Bay Area region by reducing or eliminating the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers reducing runoff and improving the health of soil and its ability to break down and filter contaminants. Flood control need: This project will improve regional stormwater management by promoting a comprehensive set of best practices that reduce runoff and keep stormwater onsite. (Bay-Friendly Landscape s rigorous standards are designated as Best Management Practices in the Regional Water Quality Control Board s Municipal Regional Stormwater NPDES Permit from 2009 to the present.) Infiltration is improved through strategies such as increased organic matter content in soil permeable paving bioswales rain gardens and other LID features. Resource stewardship need: In addition to conserving water and protecting water quality the Bay-Friendly approach protects habitat by encouraging the use of a diverse palette of native plant species and avoiding the introduction of invasive horticultural species. It provides broad benefits related to land use including decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 53 MTCO2E per acre creating and protecting habitat and providing public health benefits. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: As a result of the drought and ongoing outreach by the region s water conservation programs more people now understand the importance of using less water on their lawns and gardens. However programs and policies with an overly narrow focus on water conservation may have unintended negative consequences. Without the regional coordination and holistic approach promoted by this proposal most public and private landscape construction and renovation projects will not implement proven strategies that provide holistic benefits for the region s water resources environment and economy. Specifically if this proposal is not implemented the following critical impacts are likely to occur: Inconsistent policies and laws. While the state s Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance (WELO) provides a code baseline it has not gone far enough in its conservation or compliance requirements. Also it is strictly focused on water efficiency rather than addressing the impacts of landscapes on water resources in a more holistic way. Gov. Brown s April 1 2015 Executive Order directs the Department of Water Resources to update WELO. However without a regional forum for local governments to strengthen their policy and technical expertise and to agree on proven Best Management Practices local adaptation and adoption of WELO updates may result in an patchwork of inconsistent policies and enforcement protocols. Limited leadership. The region will miss out on the opportunity to have local governments lead by example and show property owners how to create beautiful landscapes that are drought and climate resilient.Missed opportunities for lasting improvement. The extended drought provides a perfect time to promote the adoption of a California landscape aesthetic vs. the English garden aesthetic of conventional landscapes. Property owners may replace lawns with landscapes that produce short-term reductions in water use but that may struggle to thrive due to poor soils and be less resilient with extended warmer temperatures and less summer irrigation. See the Sheet Mulch It! brochure (Attachment 1) for a detailed comparison of the benefits of conventional lawn removal vs. a sustainable approach to lawn conversion. Short-sighted actions. Property owners may think that paving over their lawns or letting them lawns die is a reasonable response to the drought not realizing the negative impacts this will have on the urban heat island effect stormwater runoff wildlife habitat and other critical regional issues. To combat climate change we need a healthy urban forest and landscapes that can store carbon cool and clean the air and survive with less irrigation.Wasted public resources. Local governments will lack a mechanism for collaborating and sharing their successes and challenges with policies and practices related to sustainable landscaping. Uninformed choices and unintended consequences. More invasive species are likely to be planted because landscape professionals and property owners will focus on drought tolerant plants without taking into account other important considerations. Invasive species crowd out native species choke waterways degrade habitats and burden public agencies with more than $80 million annually in management and removal costs. Excessive landfill waste. Gov. Brown s Executive Order calls for the replacement of 50 million square feet of lawn with drought tolerant landscapes. The conventional method of lawn replacement is to rip out the lawn. Since sod is not accepted at compost facilities this could result in up to 100000 tons of sod going to landfill. Moreover the conventional lawn replacement method is a missed opportunity to provide the soil with valuable water-conserving organic matter. The Bay-Friendly method of lawn conversion uses sheet mulch a zero waste environmentally superior alternative to conventional lawn removal. (See Attachment 1 for a comparison of conventional and sheet mulch lawn conversion methods.)Missing fundamental principles. Landscape professionals and property owners will be narrowly focused on simply replacing lawns with drought tolerant plants without understanding the important role that healthy soils rich in organic matter play in conserving water and protecting water quality and plant health.Diminished statewide influence. Bay Area governments will be in a more reactive and disorganized state as the process unfolds for updating the State Model Water Efficiency Landscape Ordinance as required by Gov. Brown s Executive Order B-29-15. ","Project Benefits: Benefits Summary Over 10 years this project will result in: Water Supply: More than 1.8 billion gallons (5637 acre-feet) saved by converting conventional landscapes to Bay-Friendly landscapesWater Quality and Flood and Stormwater Management: At least 300 acres of conventional landscapes on public properties converted to Bay-Friendly landscapes that model best practices for integrating water conservation with water quality protection and LID stormwater and flood management strategies.Resource Stewardship: More than 3040 MTCO2E avoided. More than 300 acres of landscapes converted to sustainable landscaping featuring primarily California native and climate-adapted horticultural species. Invasive plant species removed and/or not planted on 300+ acres of conventional landscape. Preliminary cost effectiveness: The preliminary cost effectiveness is estimated to be $237/acre-foot based on total project cost of $1336320 and water savings of 5637 acre-feet. This is a very conservative preliminary estimate based only on water savings from Element 1 (Policy & Civic Landscapes) and Element 2 (Sustainable Landscape Showcase). It does not factor in the project s extensive multi-benefits such as greenhouse gas emission reductions habitat protection increased infiltration water quality improvements and stormwater management improvements. It also does not factor in water savings from Element 3 (Training & Outreach) and it is based on a very conservative estimate of the number of jurisdictions likely to adopt sustainable landscape policies as a result of this project. Given the urgency that the drought adds to Bay Area water issues a much higher number of jurisdictions are likely to engage with this project Benefits Details Element 1: Policy and Civic Landscapes   Public Agency Council and Technical Assistance Activities: This element will assist Bay Area cities and counties with customizing model policy tools (such as permitting checklists model specifications water savings and GHG calculators) and ordinance adoption. This element includes hosting public agency forums to support adoption of regionally consistent landscaping policies including a daylong event with experts on green ordinance adoption to help cities envision and implement climate-adaptive landscaping standards.Outputs: At least 30 cities receive technical assistance. Cities representing 40% of the Bay Area s population participate in the project s public agency council and forums. Fifteen cities adopt sustainable landscape policies.Results: Thirty acres per year of public property is converted from conventional to sustainable landscaping resulting in 5504 acre-feet of water saved and 2970 MTCO2E avoided over 10 years and 200000 tons of landscape construction and demolition waste diverted from landfills. Attachment 2 City of Pleasanton Landscape Success Story is an example of recent civic landscape conversion project in Alameda County. Element 2: Sustainable Landscape Showcase Activities: This element will provide incentives and technical assistance to owners of eight high profile commercial properties to support their conversion from conventional to Bay-Friendly landscapes. The project s public relations activities will generate earned media coverage to draw attention to the landscape improvements thereby encouraging other residential and commercial property owners to make similar changes.Outputs: Eight sites converted for a total of at least four acres.Results: More than 43 million gallons of water saved and 72 MTCO2E avoided over 10 years and 4000 tons of landscape construction and demolition waste diverted from landfills. Element 3: Training & Outreach   Professional Training HOA & Community Outreach Web-based Toolkit Activities: Continuing education will be provided to Bay-Friendly Qualified Professionals to improve their ability to market Bay-Friendly landscape services lawn conversion programs and water agency rebates. Specialized daylong trainings will also be provided to landscape professionals on how to design build and maintain LID stormwater systems. Bay-Friendly workshops will be conducted for homeowner associations (HOAs) and other residential high water users. The Bay-Friendly Coalition s website will be enhanced with consumer-friendly outreach materials including regionally customized packages of how-to video shorts and regionally customized downloadable Plant Palettes & Plans Packages. Outputs & Results: Six hundred Bay Area landscape professionals will attend continuing education and LID stormwater training. Eight workshops will be held at large HOAs or partner organizations such as nurseries water agencies or large landscape suppliers. The online videos and outreach material packages will receive at least 75000 hits. ","  "," ","StopWaste ","1","1","0","1","1","1","1","1"
"45 ","Pinole Creek Fish Passage Improvements project at I-80 Culverts ","This project will construct fish passage improvements at the 320-ft long CalTrans I-80 double bay box culvert on Pinole Creek which is the only major barrier to upstream passage of juvenile and adult steelhead trout. Major elements include cutting and reforming a concrete fishway notch through the upper half of the western culvert bay and adding a notched sill on the downstream end to backwater the lower half of the culvert.

Habitat assessments have identified the I-80 culvert as the only substantial barrier for migrating steelhead attempting to access spawning habitat upstream. Improved access at this culvert will open approximately 7 miles of suitable spawning and rearing habitat upstream to the species as noted in habitat mapping studies (see related documents). Steelhead are currently unable to pass the I-80 culverts during the majority of flows experienced during the spawning season. As a result steelhead are only able to successfully reproduce in Pinole Creek on rare occasions when flow conditions allow passage at this structure. A healthy resident rainbow trout population in the upper watershed points to the stream's habitat suitability for supporting anadromous steelhead runs. Completion of the project will result in an increased steelhead population in the protected upper watershed and within the Pinole city limits. Increases in anadromous fish populations in Pinole Creek will benefit aquatic and terrestrial species throughout the watershed and contribute to the recovery of Central California Coast Steelhead ","Detailed description: The project concept consists of 2 major elements at the I-80 culverts: (1) cutting and reforming a concrete fishway notch through the 36-ft long inlet apron and within the upper 148 feet of the western culvert bay and forming 13 concrete angled fish baffles within the fishway notch; constructing concrete training walls on the inlet and outlet apron; adding a notched sill on the downstream end of the outlet apron to backwater the lower half of the western culvert bay and (2) constructing a 60 ft long roughened rock chute in the flood control channel downstream of the existing culvert outlet pool to prevent the formation of a drop at the culvert outlet that could limit upstream fish passage. ","Project Need: The CalTrans I-80 double bay box culvert on Pinole Creek creates a severe barrier to upstream passage of juvenile and adult steelhead trout. This is the only substantial fish barrier on Pinole Creek and the fish passage improvements project will enable steelhead to reach the quality spawning and rearing habitat found in the upper watershed and improve the potential for successful spawning. Re-establishment of a sustainable population of anadromous steelhead trout would help to restore the genetic diversity geographic distribution and viability of this Federally listed threatened species. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the proposal is not implemented the box culvert will continue to block upstream passage of anadromous steelhead at nearly all flows denying fish access to quality spawning and rearing habitat in the upper watershed. The culvert will continue to be a major limiting factor to the steelhead population in Pinole Creek. ","Project Benefits: i.

Steelhead are currently unable to pass the I-80 culverts during the majority of flows experienced during the spawning season. As a result steelhead are only able to successfully reproduce in Pinole Creek on rare occasions when flow conditions allow passage at this structure. A healthy resident rainbow trout population in the upper watershed points to the stream's habitat suitability for supporting anadromous steelhead runs. Completion of the project will result in an increased steelhead population in the protected upper watershed and within the Pinole city limits. Increases in anadromous fish populations in Pinole Creek will benefit aquatic and terrestrial species throughout the watershed and contribute to the recovery of Central California Coast Steelhead.

","Project Type Description: This project will provide a sufficient pump station that can handle the flow of 10-year storm which will protect the neighborhood from flooding. Trash and debris will be captured by a proposed automatic trash rack in the pump station. This will improve the water quality in the bay which in turn protects the habitats of the bay. ","Detailed description: This improvement project will be for the Central/Eastshore pump station. It will include the demolition of the existing station and abandoned dry well. A new station structure will be constructed and will include a wet well discharge and automatic trash rack structure. To address the current deficiencies to the pump capacity and operations and maintenance issues new pumps will be installed along with new pump barrels piping flap gates backflow preventer and hose for wash down. The insufficient outfall capacity will be corrected with the installation of a new 36-inch RCP outfall. A new standby generator and ATS will address the lacking backup power to the pump station. Installation of a automatic trash rack will pickup debris and trash that would otherwise be discharged at the outfalls. New wiring motor controls and new transformer will be required for the new equipment. A site fence will be needed to secure the pump station. ","Project Need: The City of Alameda has ten water pump stations. The primary goal is to ensure that the City's pump stations have the capacity to handle storm water flows from a 10-year storm event during the current 10-year high tide as well as during the anticipated future 10-year high tide. The reliability and capacity of these stations is of utmost importance due to the low elevations in the majority of Alameda and potential for flooding from wet weather events during high tides. Currently the Central/Eastshore storm water pump station has inefficiencies in the installed system. A hydraulic analysis of the pump station determined that the actual pumping rate when both pumps are running is significantly less than the station's design capacity. In addition the existing 21-inch outfall and pump discharge structure were analyzed to verify capacity to handle the incoming flow from a 10-year storm event during the current 10-year high tide and future high tide. It was found that at the current 10-year high tide elevation the existing pump discharge structure would be insufficient to handle the flows from the design 10-year storm. The anticipated future high tide elevation further limits the hydraulic capacity. This pump station improvement project will resolve all these issues. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the proposal is not implemented the deficiencies of the existing pump station and the pump discharge structure will likely lead to flooding resulting from a 10-year storm event during the current 10-year high tide. The lack of an automatic trash rack will allow for trash/debris to discharge at the stormwater outfall. This will impact the water quality of the bay thus impacting the habitants of the bay.

"48 ","Building Climate Change Resiliency Along the Bay with Green Infrastructure & Treated Wastewater ","Building Climate Change Resiliency Along the Bay Shoreline with Green Infrastructure and Treated Wastewater proposes to establish a partnership to construct a series of pilot ecotone slope projects integrated with San Francisco Bay wastewater treatment plants. The goals of this project are: to improve wastewater treatment by using natural marsh habitats to pre-treat pollutants; to protect vulnerable wastewater treatment plants and adjacent improvements from rising sea levels; to use treated wastewater as a resource in marsh restoration; to integrate ongoing restoration of adjacent tidal wetland habitats into a larger design to employ those restored marshes as natural barriers against regional flooding and sea level rise; and to investigate new opportunities for wastewater plants to lower their nutrient and emerging contaminant discharges to the Bay by using the Green Infrastructure model. ","('North Bay'; 'East Bay'; 'South Bay') | Alameda; Santa Clara?; Marin? ","37.6671 | -122.1567 ","ongoing ","tbd ","Oro Loma Sanitary District ","Project Type Description: The project involves the construction of shallow upland / high marsh ecotone slopes bayward of existing flood risk management levees. The ecotone slope serves to provide protection from rising sea levels further removal of nutrients from secondary effluent water reuse at a POTW; the reuse (treatment through ecotone wetlands) will improve water quality (removing nutrients; stormwater will also be treated at the ecotone; a net increase in wetlands will occur (providing increased habitat); building increased elevation wetlands around the bay will reduce flooding under rising sea level. Wastewater treatment plants of the future will be moving away from the goal of  wastewater treatment  and towards a framework of  resource recovery.  Wastewater contains two major resources that are important to the ecology of coastal ecosystems: fresh water and nutrients. Fresh water will be crucial in replenishing a coastal habitat type that has been removed from the Bay as streams were channelized the movement of groundwater into the ecotone slope. In addition wastewater contains nutrients that can stimulate the growth of wetlands around the Bay. The proposed project lights the way for the future framework   making the best use of the current fresh water resource. ","Detailed description: At least 22 wastewater treatment plants around San Francisco Bay are vulnerable to the effects of sea level rise over the next century. Oro Loma Sanitary District (OLSD) has a conceptual design to create a seepage ecotone slope to restore historical moist grassland / bayland ecotone while treating reclaimed wastewater from equalization facilities and increasing its resilience to sea level rise. This project will be permitted and constructed as the first demonstration project of Building Resiliency Along the Bay with Green Infrastructure and Treated Wastewater. Additionally a treatment facility retrofit that supports wetlands accretion will be designed and permitted at Union Sanitary District City of Hayward and Novato Sanitary District based upon confirmation of the expected results in the pilot study. A scientific peer-review committee will be convened to provide technical review and guidance for the project both for the treatment wetlands and the ecotone slope. The interdisciplinary committee will consist of leading scientists practitioners and managers from around the Bay who are well versed in the challenges opportunities and questions that the project raises. The advisory committee will provide guidance for design monitoring design adaptive management and analysis of results. In addition to the design permitting and construction of innovative treatment facilities the demonstration project will generate design guidance and implementation recommendations that will be disseminated through outreach to the Bay Area s many wastewater treatment facilities. The potential impact of this project is vast: if 25 percent of the Bay Area s wastewater treatment plants are able to build ecotone slopes (based upon Oro Loma s successful demonstration) then over 5000 acres of moist grassland / bayland ecotone can be created around the Bay. The aim of the partnership is to expand its membership to include all Bay POTWs and adjacent land use management agencies in a unified effort to test refine and construct the new Green Infrastructure paradigm. The outreach component of the project will include development and dissemination of program material in print and electronic form; meetings with prospective POTW and land use management agency partners to keep them updated about progress and discuss program findings; meetings with regional policy makers to inform them about program details including costs and benefits; meetings with community and civic organizations to build understanding and support for the project; meetings with state and federal elected officials who are ultimately responsible for oversight of program authorization and funding; and outreach to key news media providers to promote broad public awareness of and support for the project. ","Project Need: By 2050 sea level rise models show strong agreement for global sea level rise with an average of 14 inches higher than the sea level in 2000. Beyond 2050 the projections of global sea level rise depend upon the emissions generated in this century with up to 55 inches of sea level rise projected by 2100. Given that many wastewater treatment plants are located by necessity at the edge of the Bay lowest elevations within a community citizens may suffer if the plants are compromised by inundation from rising sea levels. Impaired water quality and higher temperatures can result in algal blooms and a higher potential for the spread of water-borne disease vectors. This raises key questions for resource managers in relation to climate change: identifying opportunities for tidal wetlands and mudflats to migrate landward managing and maintaining marsh accretion developing and planning for natural flood protection and maintaining sufficient upland buffer areas around tidal wetlands. Furthermore rare and valuable habitats like the moist grassland / bayland ecotone are a high priority for restoration and conservation. In addition to addressing sea level rise there are growing concerns in the San Francisco Bay related to nutrient levels and contaminants of emerging concern (CEC). Historically algal production in the Bay has been inhibited by a lack of light. Now the Bay is clearer allowing light to pass. Sampling throughout the Bay indicates increasing levels of chlorophyll an indicator for potential algal blooms. These factors are causing the Regional Water Quality Control Board to focus on the issue collect additional data and plan for ways to reduce nutrient loads to the Bay. The proposed project has the capability to provide nutrient and CEC removal from the receiving waters. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: More than 50000 acres of former and existing tidal marshes are immediately adjacent to the heavily developed urban shoreline of southern San Francisco Bay. An aging network of earthen levees provides flood protection for the developed shore. Sea level rise already is compromising the integrity of the levee system and causing increasingly frequent flooding of developed areas. This condition is forecast to get worse as sea level continues to rise. Major regional transportation corridors including highway and rail commercial and residential property and critical infrastructure such as POTWs are at risk. The project will demonstrate the advantages of employing the ecosystem services provided by a restored marsh system to provide critical flood and water quality protection benefits during the current era of sea level rise. The alternative approach of using traditional hardscape methods to safeguard existing public services would certainly be far more costly perhaps prohibitively so. In addition large areas of marshes that are currently being restored would be threatened by flooding from sea level rise and contamination from failure to manage waste and storm water effectively. Further the specific green infrastructure feature that is the centerpiece of the Oro Loma project the ecotone is targeted as central to the success of endangered species recovery. The Draft Recovery Plan for Tidal Marsh Ecosystems of Northern and Central California places priority on re-establishing terrestrial ecotones that provide high tide flood refuge cover and seasonal (spring) grassland foraging for the salt marsh harvest mouse. The list of wetland functions deemed to be of outstanding public interest that the proposed project will significantly improve include: food chain production habitat for aquatic and land species; dynamic surface water storage; energy dissipation; groundwater flow; nutrient cycling; removal of elements and compounds; retention of particulates; sequestration of organic carbon; maintenance of scarce plant community; maintenance of characteristic detrital biomass; maintenance of spatial structure of habitat etc. The opportunity for improving these wetlands functions at treatment plants will be lost. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality The seepage flow through an ecotone slope provides an effective low cost low energy and environmentally sustainable method to nearly eliminate nutrient loadings and CEC s from the receiving waters. If proven successfully the project has the potential to radically improve water quality in the San Francisco Bay. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management The project has significant flood and stormwater management benefits. The proposed ecotone slope s primary function is to provide an environmentally friendly adaptable and robust defense against flooding associated with sea level rise. During dry weather periods urban stormwater can be routed through the ecotone slope to provide treatment of common fertilizer hydrocarbon and sediment based pollutants. The proposed pilot project on the Oro Loma site will incorporate this concept by routing stormwater from an industrialized area into the ecotone. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The Oro Loma seepage ecotone slope will be the first Bay Area project to replicate an engineered equivalent of moist grassland / bayland ecotone of broad flat alluvial fans that historically graded into the tidal marshes of most of South San Francisco Bay. Historically moist grasslands vegetation (lowland wet grassland and sedge-rush meadows) were prevalent along the Estuary and in the San Lorenzo Watershed. This now rare groundwater-seep-dependent ecotone will provide important seasonal terrestrial habitat for nesting mallards and the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse (spring foraging habitat and increasingly important terrestrial high tide refuge) particularly as sea level rises. Groundwater soil and vegetation interactions of wet meadows will support important carbon and biogeochemical nutrient transformation and sequestration processes that are currently excluded from diked baylands and tidal marshes disconnected from groundwater discharges. Additionally the project will work with resource managers (Hayward Recreational Park District Bay Trail) to ensure genuine stewardship of the wetlands around the bay.

Recycled water will be produced from treated wastewater that otherwise would be discharged to the San Francisco Bay. This recycled water project will reduce the amount of wastewater discharged to the Bay thereby reduce pollutant discharge to the Bay. ","Detailed description: The project will construct a total of 2.5 miles of recycled water distribution pipeline to deliver up to 274 acre-feet per year (AFY) of recycled water initially with capacity to ultimately deliver up to 3238 AFY. The new pipelines will convey recycled water from the City's existing treatment storage and pumping facilities located at Silicon Valley Clean Water (SVCW) to new and existing City water customers. The project will be constructed as three separate project components: Phase IIA IIB and IIC. The total estimated capital cost for the three pipeline segments is $8.5 million. The Phase IIA pipeline consists of 3390 feet of new 30-inch diameter pipeline that will connect to a tee in the existing Phase I pipeline at the dead-end of Maple Street (near 1590 Maple Street the location of the San Mateo County Women s Jail). From this connection point the new pipeline will cross underneath Highway 101 inside of an existing utility tunnel to Walnut Street west of Highway 101 and follow Walnut Street to its intersection with Marshall Street. The Phase IIA work also includes construction of an 8-inch pipeline that runs east along Veterans Boulevard to Maple Street ending at the intersection of Maple Street and Oddstad Drive. The Phase IIB pipeline consists of approximately 7740 feet of new 14-inch diameter pipeline. This pipeline will connect to the Phase IIA pipeline at the intersection of Walnut Street and Marshall Street run east along Marshall Street to Beech Street south along Beech Street to Broadway east on Broadway and terminate at the intersection of Broadway and Second Avenue. Construction of the IIB pipeline will require two jack and bore crossings: approximately 115 feet to cross under the light rail track at the intersection of Broadway and Chestnut Street and approximately 225 feet to cross under the high-traffic intersection of Broadway and Woodside Road. The Phase II.C pipeline is comprised of approximately 2330 lineal feet of new pipeline. A new 30-inch-diameter pipeline will connect to the terminus of the Phase II.A pipeline at the intersection of Walnut Street and Marshall Street and run west along Marshall Street to Main Street. A 12-inch-diameter pipeline will extend from the intersection of Marshall and Main Street west along Marshall and terminate at the intersection of Marshall Street and Broadway. The City's recycled water treatment and distribution system have been designed with capacity to meet the City's needs as well as provide recycled water to neighboring communities. Redwood City and its neighboring communities purchase Hetch Hetchy water from the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. This Project will reduce the City's reliance on Hetch Hetchy supplies by offsetting potable demands on the imported water supply. This Project is located in the IRWM \"West\" sub-region of the San Francisco Bay Area. ","Project Need: This project is needed to improve the City's water supply reliability meet anticipated demands of City Council approved planned new development and to maintain compliance with State requirements for water use reduction and provides the City with a local drought-proof water supply. Historically the City's water demand has exceeded its supply. Expanding the City's use of recycled water supply reduces the City's demands on the potable water supply thereby improving supply reliability and providing a sustainable water supply that will support planned new development. City Council supports and promotes the use of recycled water and adopted a Recycled Water Use Ordinance that requires the use of recycled water for indoor and outdoor use in new construction. Additionally this project will help the City to continue to meet its urban use requirements as delineated in the Water Conservation Act of 2009 SBX7-7. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If this project is not implemented the City may not have sufficient supply to meet future demands. The City's Urban Water Management Plan includes increased recycled water use in future years to meet anticipated water demands. Without this Project the City would need to negotiate agreements for additional Hetch Hetchy water supply and continue to rely on limited potable water supply for non-potable uses.

Marin Municipal Water District (MMWD) was established in 1912 and provides drinking water to a population of about 190000 in Marin County. The MMWD treatment plants currently being used to produce drinking water were constructed in 1958 and 1961 respectively and while some seismic retrofitting has been done the treatment plants do not meet the desired level of service requirements for critical water supply infrastructure. This project will ensure that the control buildings and filters will withstand a design magnitude earthquake and be functioning within 24 hours of that earthquake. ","Detailed description: In 2015 an assessment entitled Water Treatment Plant Master Plan was conducted in order to evaluate the district s potable water treatment plants from the perspective of seismic stability and therefore the district s potential capacity to provide drinking water to the service area in Marin following a major earthquake. The assessment found that the structures were inadequate to withstand a design magnitude earthquake and identified specific work needed in order to ensure the district s ability to treat water following a major seismic event. $48.7 M in upgrade work was identified for the treatment plants. This project includes a subset of the recommended work as described below. This project will upgrade seismic and structural components of the control buildings chemical rooms and filters at both treatment plants. The work will include repairs to existing structures at know failure points such as increasing the distance to the edge of concrete for bolts that are anchoring key structural elements. Installation of concrete and steel beams and walls in the filters removal of old underdrains to facilitate the work replacement with new underdrains installation of air scour for improved media cleaning and installation of new filter media. The reliability of MMWD s water treatment plants will affect the North Bay sub region. MMWD currently receives 25% of its water supply from the Sonoma County Water Agency. In the event that the MMWD treatment plants are not function after an earthquake the SCWA will be the only source of water for MMWD s approximately 190000 customers.

Additionally Zone 7 will continue to be reliant on only two sources of supply during a catastrophic event (e.g. earthquake in the Delta or loss of the South Bay Aqueduct) and EBMUD's southeastern service area would not have access to additional sources of supply during a similar event. ","Project Benefits: A critical need identified by the BARR Partnership is to work cooperatively to inter-connect their water systems with interties to leverage existing facilities and if needed build new ones (e.g. desalination infiltration treatment or storage) to bolster regional water supply reliability to protect against droughts and emergencies while preparing for climate change. For example after disruptions in regular water supply sources or during planned outages of critical systems the BARR Partnership could wheel temporary water supplies through these interties to ensure adequate amounts of water are available to help meet health and safety needs while minimizing customer curtailments. BARR Partners have already completed several interties: EBMUD-SFPUC and SFPUC-SCVWD in 2002 and EBMUD-CCWD in 2007. An intertie between EBMUD and Zone 7 is one of the last remaining interties necessary to link all of the agencies associated with the BARR Partnership. This intertie not only provides an essential lifeline for Zone 7 during a catastrophic event (e.g. record drought earthquake in the Delta or loss of the South Bay Aqueduct) but also allows Zone 7 to wheel or share regional groundwater and surface water resources with other agencies. The intertie also reduces Zone 7 s reliance on both the State Water Project and diversions from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.

","Detailed description: The Albany Beach Restoration and Public Access Project - consists of shoreline repair and reconstruction habitat enhancement beach renovation recreational amenities and construction of San Francisco Bay Trail public access improvements. The project will repair and reconstruction and install accessibility improvements to 2000 feet of shoreline along the Albany Neck shoreline. In addition the project will include beach and dune enhancement recreation improvements restroom parking and construction of 800 feet of new San Francisco Bay Trail at Albany Beach. The Albany Neck shoreline reconstruction will include removal of debris including concrete and metal rubble possible recontouring shoreline slopes to create intertidal and subtidal habitat placement of stabilized rock toe and slope protection shoreline rock soil and geotextile fabric placement and planting native grasses and shrubs on upper slopes. The goal is to minimize bay fill to only that which is required to maintain public and emergency vehicle access along the south Neck and for beneficial habitat enhancement and needed shoreline stabilization. Removal of debris including broken concrete asphalt and metal rubble along the existing trail grading of trail to provide positive drainage placement of permeable trail surface to meet accessibility guidelines along Albany Neck; and earthwork to grade an ADA compliant access to the sandy beach. Removal of nonnative invasive species adjacent to trail planting new native grasses and shrubs and installation of post and cable fence to limit access to restored planting areas and steep shoreline slopes. The Albany Beach restoration and dune enhancement will included removing treated wood inorganic debris and invasive plants at beach area demolition of a 2.8-acre paved parking area sand placement to help support a broad low-profile beach and support existing and expanded dune features and adapt to anticipated conditions under sea level rise. Approximately 2000 cubic yards of carefully selected clean sand would be placed on the beach above the line of highest tide and an additional 3000 cubic yards placed to enhance and expand the dunes within the existing parking lot. The dunes would be stabilized using native dune vegetation. The project expands existing seasonally inundated wetlands and plants them with native vegetation and removes invasive plants and inorganic debris from wetlands. Stormwater management activities comprises earthwork to create bioswales and ponding areas to manage and treat on-site runoff from impervious surfaces. A major portion of this would be routed through the enhanced seasonal wetlands. Parking and Water Trail access includes facilities for non-motorized watercraft 20-stall parking lot to provide ADA access and non-motorized watercraft access and staging dual vault-type restroom bicycle racks picnic benches park signage and interpretive exhibits and the reconstruction of existing trail at Albany Peninsula as ADA accessible trail (San Francisco Bay Trail Spur). ","Project Need: The site was used for urban landfill from the 1950s to the early 1980s with fill consisting mainly of construction debris containing concrete asphalt metals and foundry slag. Currently the shoreline is lined with large chunks of rubble deep voids between pieces of debris and expanses of loose soil adjacent to and eroding into San Francisco Bay. The restoration project located in a cove along the southern portion of an area known as the Albany Neck will produce comprehensive shoreline stabilization which will reduce erosion and sedimentation into the Bay thereby improving water quality and create and enhance rocky intertidal habitat along the south side of Albany Neck provide sandy beach dune habitat improvements expand and enhance wetlands and provide improved public access. The project places the highest priority for improvements on areas of observed erosion that potentially threaten water quality and stability of landfill areas. The site acquired in 1998 in partnership with California Department of Parks and Recreation is subject to California Regional Water Quality Control Board's Order No. 98-072 (Board Order) which directed remediation of hazardous materials found in the landfill. Since the implementation of the Board Order in 1998 shoreline erosion has accelerated and now exposes undocumented landfill debris to wave action from the San Francisco Bay. The project will correct this condition by constructing a stabilized shoreline barrier that prevents discharge of wastes or hazardous substances to the San Francisco Bay. Project design will further develop hydro-dynamic modeling data developed in a feasibility study for the stabilization and protective barrier features to withstand 100-year sea level rise projections. Approximately 1700 feet of shoreline will be improved by removing debris including large rubble (concrete and asphalt) and hazardous objects and invasive vegetation. Rock clusters/groins will be placed to create a more topographically diverse intertidal shoreline and anchor pocket beaches. Rock clusters will stabilize and trap sand to help create and maintain new beach features and improve habitat values. Habitat design and function will account for anticipated sea-level rise and incorporate features that support desired habitat conditions for native rockweed (Fucus gardneri) which provides both physical habitat and food for fish shorebirds and macro-invertebrates. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The Neck is an armored and reflective (wave energy) feature which is actively eroding to varying degrees based on location and orientation as well as topographic and material conditions. An ad hoc mix of materials consisting of concrete construction debris and rock armor the shoreline along the Neck. High wave runup and overtopping events induce erosion within the bank which damages the integrity of the nonengineered structure and threatens the upper sections of the slope including existing pathways. Specifically the toe is eroding due to the reflection of incident wave energy. The reflected wave energy is focused onto the corner at the Beach. Portions of the existing trail and areas under consideration for future public access are impacted by the runup and overtopping events. The current configuration and conditions of the shoreline along the southern edge of the Neck will not support proposed habitat enhancement and public access improvements over time. Erosion along the Neck shoreline will increase as sea level rises which will allow larger waves to impact and degrade the Neck shoreline. Although the structure is fixed in place the toe and crest of the Neck will experience greater rates and frequency of erosion by wave runup and overtopping. The trail behind the crest will also be susceptible to damage by wave overtopping. The steep slopes located on the southern shoreline of the Neck are subject to erosion from both storm water runoff across the slope face and waves along the toe of slope. The surface of the Neck and Plateau is also subject to erosion from storm water runoff. Concrete and other construction debris can exacerbate erosion by concentrating and focusing flows onto less resistant materials leading to piping of soils through the fill matrix. Relative sea level rise projections specific to the Albany shoreline should account for issues such as land subsidence rates as well as the range of uncertainty in selected sea level rise projections. The geologically young Bay Muds and fill materials on the Albany Peninsula are relatively  uncompacted  and unsettled which may lead to consolidation and settlement or subsidence over time on the order of 1.5 to 5 feet. Settlement at the Plateau Neck and Bulb is expected to occur based upon two separate mechanisms: compression of debris fill and consolidation of Bay Mud. The compression of the fill is expected to occur due to raveling (movement of fine particles into voids) decomposition chemical reactions and compaction and consolidation due to self-weight of the fill. The consolidation of underlying Bay Mud is expected to occur due to the weight of the overlying fill. Settlement would most likely manifest itself as undulations on the ground surface. It is estimated that the Plateau area will settle between 2 to 2.75 feet over the period from 1989 to 2039. Additional settlement could occur in the Plateau area due to new loads (additional fill or building loads) transferred to the underlying Bay Mud layer. In addition subsidence will influence erosion risk and the suitability of soil types for specific restoration and improvement measures. Surface erosion is expected to be an ongoing geotechnical issue on the Bulb Neck and Plateau. The primary threats to sensitive habitats in the study area are disturbance from public access (e.g. people and dogs) and sea level rise. Under existing conditions the shoreline beach and dunes have little or no room to adapt (move landward) in response to sea level rise. Protection of sensitive habitats within the Albany Beach study area will require protection measures that can be implemented immediately (e.g. fencing signage) in combination with long-term approaches for managing these habitats over time with respect to sea level rise conditions (e.g. expansion stabilization). Opportunities for preservation and protection of many of the sensitive habitats at Albany Beach are directly linked to suggested actions for shoreline protection and beach dune and wetland expansion. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality A goal of the proposed project design is to comply with Waste Discharge Requirement Order 98-072 issued by the Regional Board. To achieve compliance implementation of the landfill shoreline stabilization and trail enhancement on Albany Neck will avoid landfill waste coming into contact with ponded water from any source; deposition of further waste deposited or stored at the site; or leachate from landfill waste and ponded water containing leachate or in contact with solid wastes from the landfill being discharged to waters of the State or United States. The proposed project places a high priority on maintaining the landfill cap and avoiding water quality impacts to San Francisco Bay. Without comprehensive shoreline stabilization future shoreline failure could cause erosion of landfill material into San Francisco Bay and violate the waste discharge requirements of Regional Water Quality Control Board Order. Partial or patchy repair of eroded areas would contribute to shoreline weakness where repaired areas transition to non-engineered fill. These transitional points of contact over time will likely fail causing erosion to spread to other areas. Failed areas would require continual maintenance and shoreline stabilization. Within areas of shoreline fill that were not properly engineered (i.e. existing condition) anticipated sea level rise will cause new areas of erosion and shoreline failure. A one-time comprehensive repair will be expensive but in the long term is more cost effective because patch repairs and substantial long-term maintenance burdens will be avoided. Improve site drainage and water quality: direct surface runoff generated on the site through a system of bioswales or vegetated channels integrated with the existing back dune wetlands. Expansion of the wetland beyond the existing property boundary is an opportunity to increase storm water storage and passive treatment capacity. Stabilize eroding shoreline: stabilization of eroding shorelines is an opportunity to limit sedimentation and degradation of sensitive habitats. Improve stormwater drainage and trail surface: regrade the trail on the southern slope of the Neck to improve drainage and sediment control direct surface runoff generated on the trail system to bioswales or vegetated channels for improved percolation and on-site treatment. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Flood and stormwater management is about at the seaward edge of the trail or the top of the armor. The roughness of the existing armor and rubble limits the height that the runup could potentially reach but the trail is impacted and likely contributes to winnowing and erosion along the trail. Along the Beach significant flooding is expected. Although the runup is lower at the Beach because the slope is flatter low areas and pathways through the dunes could cause significant flooding in and behind the dunes. Along the south shoreline the ground elevation is significantly lower than the runup elevation and waves are expected to reach approximately 50 feet inland. The estimates for total water level (TWL) will guide planning evaluation and design of restoration and public access improvements for Albany Beach. Appropriate consideration of the future TWL conditions and influence on the site will also provide a framework for adaptive management and maintenance of the site. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The project will protect the dune habitat at the Albany Beach by introducing fencing. Dune vegetation will be restored by removing noxious weeds (e.g. iceplant and Kikuyu grass) and planting locally native species that are adapted to this habitat and explore the feasibility of re-introducing rare or endangered species that are native to the Bay Area such as California seablite San Francisco spineflower and robust spineflower to the dune area. The project will expand the dune areas behind the beach and protect and enhance eelgrass beds that exist off Albany Beach. It will Enhance beach/Bay access and create Bay Water Trail access for non-motorized watercraft by creating a vehicle drop-off and parking at the south end of the beach. Installation of park furnishings such as restrooms benches and interpretive signage will significantly enhance the recreational experience of park visitors. An improved segment of the San Francisco Bay Trail adjacent the beach area will close a key gap in the San Francisco Bay Trail.

","Detailed description: Construct a row of sheet piles and associated bank stabilization and revegetation in Rodeo Creek to stop the upward migration of a large destabilizing head cut in the creek. The sheet piles can be located downstream closer to current location of the head cut but the more logical location for construction and maintenance is at the Christy Road crossing of the creek located about 500 feet upstream of the head cut. Here the sheet piles can be installed below the existing grade and would then be available to counteract the upward migration of the head cut. Full stabilization of Rodeo Creek is unlikely and impractical. But some tree planting efforts would be included to partially counteract the mature trees that have already been undermined and collapsed into the quickly deepening creek. ","Project Need: Rodeo Creek has long exhibited signs of severe erosion and channel degradation in the upper portion of the watershed. This has forced relocation of underground utilities crossing the creek and a large retaining wall to hold up the adjacent roadway and railroad.

At the Christy Road crossing with roughly the same tributary area in the creek Rodeo Creek is approximately 15 feet deep. The headcut is moving upstream and true creek stability is elusive. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If no grade control is introduced eventually Christy Road (a County-maintained roadway) will be washed out and a much large bridge would be needed to span the expanded unstable creek.

Several disadvantaged communities are located in area vulnerable to flooding from sea level rise including West Oakland Richmond San Rafael Bayview/Hunters Point and Alviso. ","Detailed description: The regional sea level rise adaptation strategy would be pursued initially in three phases: (1) considering sea level rise exposure in the current SCS and its Environmental Impact Report; (2) convening and supporting subregional and local sea level rise adaptation planning efforts and incorporating lessons learned in the region s second SCS; and (3) developing a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy that integrates tasks one and two and incorporates protection of regionally important environmental resources. Sea level rise adaptation planning is an ongoing iterative process based on the concept of adaptive management. Because sea level will continue rising over time new and different adaptation strategies will need to be conceived tested funded and implemented on an ongoing basis to adapt to these changing circumstances and to the lessons learned from earlier efforts. It is important to note that while the sea level rise work is underway regional and local stakeholders will also be moving forward with adaptation planning for heat waves energy shortages drought and other climate impacts. These two tracks need to be closely coordinated and eventually brought together in the second and third iterations of the SCS. The logistics and timelines for developing these other strategies will be coordinated through the Bay Area Climate and Energy Resilience Project which is being managed by the Joint Policy Committee consultants. The implementation of the sea level rise work plan would be undertaken by ABAG and BCDC in consultation with the staffs of MTC BAAQMD and the Coastal Conservancy which in partnership with ABAG administers the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority a potential source of revenue for flood protection and wetland restoration. The work plan would be carried out in coordination with the Bay Area Flood Protection Agencies Association and integrated into the Bay Area Integrated Regional Water Management Plan (IRWMP) which coordinates the work of the many organizations and agencies that deal with water management and habitat protection. The Coastal Conservancy plays a key role in the management of the IRWMP. The entire effort is expected to take between five and ten years depending on available funding and other resources. Funding for the project would come from a variety of sources including grants and in-kind resources from federal agencies foundations state and regional agencies and local governments. ","Project Need: 1. What is the relative importance of addressing the project or issue in achieving the goals of economic prosperity and environmental sustainability in the Bay Area? Sea level rise from global warming is a fact. Water levels in San Francisco Bay have risen nearly eight inches over the past century and scientists agree that the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. While exact future increases in sea level rise are uncertain the State of California has adopted guidance for state agencies which indicates that Bay may rise 10 to 17 inches by 2050 17 to 32 inches by 2070 and 31 to 69 inches by the end of the century. Sea level rise is a particularly acute problem for the Bay Area because 240 square miles of shoreline land was reclaimed from the Bay by filling it just high enough to be above past sea level but not above future sea level. Also because of land subsidence parts of the South Bay where a number of high-profile Silicon Valley companies are located are below current sea level. Approximately 330 square miles of low-lying land around the Bay may be vulnerable to sea level rise over the next century. Numerous critical regional assets are located within these areas vulnerable to flooding. Some of these assets include San Francisco s financial district Mission Bay Treasure Island San Francisco International Airport Oakland International Airport the headquarters of a number of Silicon Valley companies highways railroads and communities. In addition to determining how best to protect existing economic assets the Bay Area needs a cohesive strategy for increasing job growth and enhancing economic prosperity in the decades ahead. To achieve these goals it will be necessary to continue to attract private investment capital to the Bay region. If investors are concerned about the long-term economic viability of development located in areas vulnerable to flooding or if underwriters will not insure such development the Bay Area will be at a distinct competitive disadvantage in securing this needed investment capital. Therefore a regional strategy for addressing sea level rise adaptation is critical to the region s continued economic prosperity. Other regions states and nations that are facing flood danger from sea level rise are embarking on programs to deal with this challenge. A Sea Level Rise Adaptation Strategy for San Diego Bay has been prepared by ICLEI  Local Governments for Sustainability through a collaborative regional stakeholder process that included most of the public agencies and private sector representatives with a major interest in the future of San Diego Bay. Four Florida counties have established the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact to partner in mitigating the causes and adapting to the consequences of climate change particularly flooding. Recognizing that New York City has more than 520 miles of coastline and is among the top ten port cities in the world that are most exposed to coastal flooding New York City s plan called PlaNYC is being updated to deal with the complex welter of climate issues facing the city. Delaware is developing a plan for sea level rise that will recommend policy changes and practices to ensure that Delaware makes informed policy and investment decisions to prevent damage and losses to infrastructure resources and homes. To avoid losses from flooding the province of British Columbia Canada is incorporating sea level rise projections into coastal management practices and planning. The City of Vancouver British Columbia has designed a climate change adaptation strategy to tackle a potential increase in street flooding sewer backups damaged forests and heat-related illnesses. Toronto and Halifax already have such plans in place. Rotterdam Netherlands has an overarching adaptation plan called Rotterdam Climate Proof which allows for climate considerations across all departments and infrastructure types and enables innovative projects and widespread policy changes. A regional sea level rise adaptation strategy is also critical to the environmental sustainability of the Bay Area. The goal of the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project is to enhance over 16000 acres of diked ponds formerly used for salt making. An additional 10000 acres of former salt ponds in the North Bay are being restored to wetlands in the Napa-Sonoma Marsh Restoration Project. Together these two initiatives form the nation s largest wetland restoration project outside the Everglades. Wetlands provide flood protection by attenuating wave energy. However tidal wetlands exist only at intertidal elevations and are therefore vulnerable to sea level rise. Moreover some undeveloped low-lying areas that are vulnerable to shoreline flooding contain important habitat or provide opportunities for habitat enhancement. In these areas development could preclude wetland enhancement. Therefore protecting existing wetlands and addressing the trade-off between development and habitat enhancement is critical to the environmental and economic sustainability of the Bay Area. 2. How broad is the support among government equity environmental and business interests for the JPC to provide leadership on the project or issue? It took BCDC over five years to formulate the Bay Plan climate change amendment the Commission adopted in late 2011. During the 26-month public review period BCDC held 36 public hearings workshops and stakeholder meetings which which were contentious at times. Some development and business interests initially argued that the proposed policies would discourage development and economic investment in the Bay Area while environmental groups pressed BCDC to issue a moratorium on new shoreline development. Local governments also raised concerns about the policies fearing that they would allow BCDC to intrude into local planning decisions. To deal with these concerns BCDC met with local governments and extended the public comment period for several months. Throughout this process the amendment language was revised and refined to respond to the excellent ideas advanced by stakeholders local governments and the general public. In the end the business community developers labor and environmental organizations and local governments supported the amended policies and BCDC unanimously approved the amendment. One of the critical elements in securing this support was BCDC s position that the JPC should take the lead in formulating a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy and that the strategy should be integrated with the planning of the other JPC member agencies. Therefore there is broad support for the JPC to provide regional leadership on the issue of sea level rise. 3. If the JPC does not provide leadership on the project or issue will another entity do so? Given the magnitude of the threat posed by sea level rise to shoreline assets communities and resources it is inevitable that some entity (or entities) will deal with the issue  eventually. The question is whether this action will come about only after a series of floods make the vulnerability more obvious or whether new laws or other external pressure mandate the JPC (or another entity) to assume a leadership role. Some individual local jurisdictions are studying the impacts of sea level rise and beginning to incorporate consideration of greater coastal flooding into their planning. For example the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission is planning to retrofit shoreline sewage treatment facilities to prevent flood damage and the City of Mountain View has allocated $300000 to study the impacts of sea level rise. On a broader scale sub-regional efforts are coordinating sea level rise planning across a number of jurisdictions. The BCDC-initiated Adapting to Rising Tides Project is a multi-jurisdictional partnership that is assessing flood vulnerability and risk assessment along a portion of the Alameda County shoreline from Emeryville to Union City. The San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority is leading a consortium of county and city agencies to formulate an integrated shoreline and watershed flood protection strategy for the communities along San Francisquito Creek in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. A public/private partnership in Silicon Valley aims to raise over $1 billion over the next decade to build engineered levees from Redwood City around the south end of the Bay up to Hayward and to contribute to the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project. While these individual local efforts are valuable and the sub-regional pilot projects will provide valuable information and intergovernmental approaches ultimately some aspects of sea level rise have regional impacts that require a regional response. Fifty-five local governments have land use authority over portions of the 1000 miles of Bay shoreline. Special districts which have no land use authority have the responsibility for flood protection along much of the shoreline. Other special districts are responsible for wetland restoration which can play a critical role in a regional sea level rise and flood protection strategy. Coordination among these entities is essential in formulating a strategy that has no weak points in the flood protection system and can protect resources that span jurisdictions. The State of California took an important leadership role on climate change adaptation when it released the  California Climate Adaptation Strategy  in 2009. That strategy was directed primarily to actions state agencies should take to prepare for the impacts of climate change in the decades ahead. The State is currently in the process of updating that strategy and expanding it to include actions local governments could (and should) be taking. While such actions are not currently mandated by the State if it becomes clear that the State s interests cannot be advanced without local engagement legislation could be enacted to achieve this. Thus JPC leadership on a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy can be seen as more of an opportunity than an obligation. Regional leadership is clearly needed. If the JPC does not exercise that leadership now either some other entity may eventually do so at its own initiative or the JPC or some entity may be required to do so. The JPC provides this leadership now in a manner that reflects the perspectives of its member agencies and advances the regional interests of the Bay Area. Therefore it would be prudent for the JPC to proactively take on this leadership role now rather than have to react to a possible future initiative that may not be fully consistent with Bay Area conditions. Finally the JPC already has the responsibility for coordinating the activities of its four member agencies in the development of the Sustainable Communities Strategy. It is critical that any regional sea level rise adaptation strategy be integrated to the maximum degree feasible into the SCS that is scheduled to be adopted in 2013 and be fully integrated into the next iterations of the SCS that will be adopted ever four years thereafter. Therefore the JPC is uniquely positioned to provide regional leadership on a sea level rise adaptation strategy. 4. Are resources available to support the JPC s leadership role on the project or issue? ABAG BCDC and MTC have some existing financial resources that have been committed to continuing current assessments of sea level rise and formulating adaptation measures. However there are no funds currently appropriated for or specifically available to formulate a comprehensive regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. However the four regional agencies have been effective in generating financial support that is needed to advance regional objectives. Over the past five years BCDC has been able to secure $1.72 million from federal grants special funds and other sources to undertake its pioneering work in sea level rise assessment and planning for the Bay Area. The BAAQMD faced a similar problem when it decided to integrate consideration of greenhouse gas emissions into the agency s regulatory functions. To secure revenue for this purpose the BAAQMD adopted a GHG fee paid by regulated industry which generates approximately $1 million annually. Similarly no funds were appropriated or available to develop the SCS pursuant to SB 375. To meet this mandate MTC allocated Proposition 84 funds it received along with a considerable investment of its own funds. In addition a $5 million HUD grant is funding planning that is being incorporated into the SCS and ABAG has received over $2 million from the Strategic Growth Council in Proposition 84 funds to support SCS work. ABAG also received $830000 from multiple sources for disaster preparedness planning. Based on this experience it may seem reasonable to assume that the JPC agencies may be able to use their entrepreneurial effectiveness to secure the funds needed to underwrite the cost of formulating a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. However it should also be recognized that while the four agencies have been equal partners in advancing the objectives of the JPC they have not had equal access to financial resources to provide for the funding of JPC activities. For example MTC has borne the lion s share of the cost of developing the SCS. Also MTC and the BAAQMD fund the two JPC consultants while ABAG contributes office space and administrative support for the consultants. As a state agency BCDC has relatively little direct control over its budget and due to ongoing state budget constraints BCDC has only been able to provide in-kind staff work to support JPC activities. This unequal funding approach may not be sustainable over the long term and may eventually have to be replaced with a new funding model that relies on some combination of more equitable financial contributions from all four JPC partners and far more external grants or special funding to finance JPC activities. In light of this situation we believe the JPC should depart slightly from its adopted policies and procedures in deciding whether to take a leadership role in facilitating the formulation of a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. These procedures call for the JPC to first make a decision on whether to take on this leadership role and then for the agency staff to prepare a work plan for carrying out the leadership role. However given the potential fiscal magnitude of formulating a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy the agency staffs have prepared a preliminary work plan that identifies the costs and possible funding sources for preparing a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. We believe providing this work plan will assist the JPC in making a policy decision on its regional leadership role in sea level rise planning. This preliminary work plan (Attachment B) was developed by the staffs of ABAG and BCDC in consultation with the staffs of the BAAQMD and MTC and the JPC s consultants. It is appropriate for BCDC and ABAG to take on joint leadership in formulating both the work plan and the adaptation strategy because of BCDC s recognized role as a national leader in sea level rise adaptation planning and because of the critical responsibilities the local government members of ABAG will have in formulating and implementing a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. To advance the goal of having a single integrated Plan Bay Area the primary thrust of the work plan is to fully integrate the regional sea level rise adaptation strategy into the Sustainability Communities Strategy that is being formulated pursuant to SB 375. The work plan envisions a sea level rise strategy being pursued in three phases: (1) considering sea level rise exposure in the current SCS and its Environmental Impact Report using existing financial resources; (2) convening and supporting subregional and local planning adaptation planning efforts and incorporating lessons learned in the region s second SCS; and (3) developing a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy that integrates tasks one and two and incorporates protection of regionally important environmental resources into the third SCS. To augment the efforts of the JPC agencies the California State Coastal Conservancy should be actively engaged in formulating the regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. The Coastal Conservancy administers the San Francisco Bay Area Conservancy Program which provides grants and staff assistance to improve public access to the Bay; to protect restore and enhance natural habitats; and to assist in the implementation of the policies of the San Francisco Bay Plan and the adopted plans of local governments and special districts. The Conservancy also works in partnership with ABAG to administer the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority which is empowered to levy a benefit assessment special tax or property-related fees to raise funds needed for wildlife habitat restoration related public access recreation and flood protection projects. Since funding the implementation of a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy will be a critical issue in deciding which elements should be incorporated into the strategy it is imperative to engage an agency that has the authority to raise funds at the outset the strategy formulation process. In addition because the formulation of the strategy relies heavily on developing a working partnership with that local agencies that are responsible for flood protection the Bay Area Flood Protection Agencies Association (BAFPAA) and the Bay Area Water Agencies Coalition (BAWAC) should be engaged in the development of the sea level rise strategy from the outset. This can be accomplished by integrating the strategy into the Bay Area Integrated Regional Water Management Plan (IRWMP) which coordinates the work of BAFPAA BAWAC and the many other organizations and agencies that deal with water management and habitat protection. The Coastal Conservancy plays a key role in the management of the IRWMP. If the JPC decides a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy is needed and that the preliminary work plan for formulating such a strategy is reasonable if any of the funding needed to develop the strategy is to be provided by JPC member agencies the funding would have to be agreed upon by the regional agencies contributing funds. 5. Is there likely to be a significant impact on achieving the mandated responsibilities of one of the regional agencies if the JPC does not take on a leadership role on the project or issue? Diking filing land reclamation projects carried out between 1850 and 1960 reduced the size of San Francisco Bay by one-third. Two-thirds of the remaining Bay was shallow enough to reclaim. BCDC was established in 1965 to prevent this shrinking of the Bay to continue and was empowered to deal with the problem by regulating new Bay fill projects. In other words BCDC was created to prevent the Bay from getting smaller. However sea level rise will make the Bay larger a problem BCDC was not established to address and which it had no authority to control. AB 2094 (DeSaulnier) enacted in 2008 to add BCDC as a voting member of the JPC addressed this shortcoming by allowing BCDC to engage in the development of a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. Specifically AB 2094 provides: The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission in coordination with local governments regional councils of government and other agencies and interested parties may develop regional strategies as needed for addressing the impacts of and adapting to the effects of sea level rise and other impacts of global climate change on the San Francisco Bay and affected shoreline areas. These regional strategies may include but are not limited to the following: (a) Identification of areas that may be subject to erosion inundation or other impacts from sea level rise and climate change. (b) Economic and environmental analyses of the benefits and costs of protecting the areas likely to be impacted. Thus there would be a significant impact on BCDC in carrying out this provision of law if the JPC does not take on a leadership role in the formulation of a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. There are multiple local state federal and regional government agencies with authority over the Bay and shoreline. The local governments that are members of ABAG have broad authority over shoreline land use within their boundaries but no authority over the actions of adjacent jurisdictions and the decisions of state and federal agencies. Local governments also have limited resources to address climate change adaptation. Coordinating adaptation strategies among the agencies involved and securing financial support to plan and implement these strategies will have to be a key component of an effective regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. Therefore there will be a significant impact on the mandated responsibilities of the local government members of ABAG if such a regional strategy is not undertaken. The shoreline of the Bay is largely surrounded by transportation infrastructure including freeways highways railroads ports and airports. As a result these transportation linkages will be the first to experience the flooding impacts caused by climate change induced sea level rise and storms. Disruptions in mobility will have impacts region-wide far beyond the areas flooded. Therefore the formulation of a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy facilitated by the JPC will impact MTC transportation facility owners and operators and local congestion management agencies in fulfilling their mandated responsibilities. Conclusion and Recommendation. It is appropriate for the JPC to take on a leadership role in facilitating the formulation of a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy as requested by BCDC. JPC should fulfill this facilitation role through its responsibilities for regional leadership (i.e. by providing regional leadership and advocacy of the critical regional economic and environmental importance of having an effective sea level rise adaptation strategy) and for regional agency coordination (i.e. by exercising its authority to coordinate the regional agencies and to resolve any conflicts that arise in the development a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy and its integration into the SCS). To optimize scarce resources and create the flexibility needed to plan amidst a high degree of uncertainty it is essential that a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy be developed collaboratively with local governments and especially local agencies with responsibility for flood protection. Moreover retrofitting the Bay Area s transportation infrastructure system to be resilient to flooding will be extraordinarily expensive. However the potential exists that the process of providing flood protection for transportation facilities can also provide flood protection for low-lying area inland of the transportation facilities along the shoreline. The JPC provides a framework for coordinating the planning and policy development of its four member agencies and local governments; for advancing consistent and effective regional decision-making to address climate change; and for providing local governments with assistance and incentives for addressing climate change. To take advantage of these opportunities the JPC can play a critically important role in facilitating the formulation of a regional sea level rise adaptation strategy. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Sea level rise from global warming is a fact. Water levels in San Francisco Bay have risen nearly eight inches over the past century and scientists agree that the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. While exact future increases in sea level rise are uncertain the State of California has adopted guidance for state agencies which indicates that Bay may rise 10 to 17 inches by 2050 17 to 32 inches by 2070 and 31 to 69 inches by the end of the century. Sea level rise is a particularly acute problem for the Bay Area because 240 square miles of shoreline land was reclaimed from the Bay by filling it just high enough to be above past sea level but not above future sea level. Also because of land subsidence parts of the South Bay where a number of high-profile Silicon Valley companies are located are below current sea level. Approximately 330 square miles of low-lying land around the Bay may be vulnerable to sea level rise over the next century. Numerous critical regional assets are located within these areas vulnerable to flooding. Some of these assets include San Francisco s financial district Mission Bay Treasure Island San Francisco International Airport Oakland International Airport the headquarters of a number of Silicon Valley companies highways railroads and communities. In addition to determining how best to protect existing economic assets the Bay Area needs a cohesive strategy for increasing job growth and enhancing economic prosperity in the decades ahead. To achieve these goals it will be necessary to continue to attract private investment capital to the Bay region. If investors are concerned about the long-term economic viability of development located in areas vulnerable to flooding or if underwriters will not insure such development the Bay Area will be at a distinct competitive disadvantage in securing this needed investment capital. Therefore a regional strategy for addressing sea level rise adaptation is critical to the region s continued economic prosperity. ","Project Benefits: i.

In January of 2006 overflows of Alhambra Creek caused approximately one million dollars in damage to this school property. The possibility of housing developments upstream in the middle watershed would bring increased impervious surface that could intensify future flooding at this downstream site. In April of 2012 the Martinez Unified School District(MUSD)Board of Education voted to spend 5.2 million dollars to contruct new campus buildings at this site. As of 9/2012 preliminary concepts and designs are being developed for MUSD Board consideration to see how far that $5.2M can stretch. This is the ideal time to develop and integrate flood protection LID measures and riparian corridor restoration into the overall building design for the new campus. Routing floodwaters through bioswales between the buildings out to the parking area/detention basin could protect this major investment in new construction. The current parking area covers 1.4 acres with an adjacent .5 acre paved lot. Converting this areaand possibly pedestrian walkways to pervious surface could yield between 1.4 to 2 acres of infiltration surface. During the creek channel widening in 2005 native trout were discovered in the creek at this site. It was theorized that cooler water from groundwater seepage into the creek was creating preferable temperature conditions at this location that attracted the trout. Adding a large infiltration area could only improve conditions. The Alhambra Watershed Council has offered to assist in developing ways to organically integrate the creek and an expanded riparian buffer zone into the campus design so that it can become an educational resource and community asset while simultaneously increasing flood protection and improving water quality in the creek. One aspect of this integration would be the self-guided nature trail along the edge of the riparian zone for the 620 feet of school property. This would be developed by the award-winning environmentally focused high school program \"The New Leaf Collaborative for Sustainable Living\" that has been housed at this campus since 2005. (see http://www.martinez.k12.ca.us/schools/briones/esa/) ","Project Need: The need for this project has been demonstrated by the estimated $1 million in flood damage from the 2006 New Year's Day flood. The school district has a plan to completely renovate this campus and replace aging \"portable\" trailers with new buildings. If this flood protection work is not integrated into the campus renovation the new structures will be in jeopardy of future flood damage. This project would provide the opportunity to also integrate state-of-the-art LID and \"green\" stormwater practices into this campus renovation. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If this flood protection work is not integrated into the campus renovation the new campus buildings will be in jeopardy of future flood damage and future expense.

","Detailed description: In 2003 the California Department of Fish and Game and the US Fish and Wildlife Service acquired 15100 acres of salt ponds in three pond complexes (Ravenswood Eden Landing and Alviso) in South San Francisco Bay. Restoration flood management and public access planning and implementation are being facilitated by the State Coastal Conservancy in cooperation with the landowners (California Department of Fish and Game and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) flood management agencies (Santa Clara Valley Water District Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) regulatory agencies scientists and stakeholders. The programmatic plan for the entire project area was completed in 2009 and will include tidal restoration for endangered and aquatic species enhancement of ponds for migratory shorebirds and waterfowl tidal and fluvial flood management measures including construction of flood protection levees and removal of salt pond berms alongside sloughs and creeks to increase conveyance and public access improvements such as Bay Trail segments. Phase I implementation is nearly complete and planning for Phase II is underway. Phase II SBSP Restoration projects will consist of tidal wetland restoration projects and creation of enhanced managed ponds at the 3 pond complexes as well as trail linkages. Following quickly on the heels of these Phase II actions will be implementation of flood management and additional ecosystem restoration measures identified in the Congressionally-authorized South San Francisco Bay Shoreline Study. The Corps of Engineers Santa Clara Valley Water District and the California State Coastal Conservancy expect to complete the Shoreline Study in 2014 and construct a flood protection levee in the Alviso area which will allow the restoration of the Ponds A9-A15 in Alviso Pond complex. Purpose: The South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project and South San Francisco Bay Shoreline Study represent an unprecedented opportunity to restore the health of San Francisco Bay. The goals of these projects are to: 1. Create the largest restored wetland on the West Coast of the United States providing extensive habitat for federally endangered species and migratory birds; 2. Provide tidal and fluvial flood protection in South San Francisco Bay including approximately 42800 acres 7400 homes and businesses and significant urban development such as roads and highways parks airports and wastewater treatment plants in Santa Clara County alone; and 3. Improve wildlife-oriented public access and recreational opportunities including hiking fishing hunting environmental education and birdwatching. The objectives for the projects are to: 1. Create restore or enhance habitats of sufficient size function and appropriate structure to:   Promote restoration of native special-status plants and animals that depend on South San Francisco Bay habitat for all or part of their life cycles.   Maintain current migratory bird species that utilize existing salt ponds and associated structures such as levees.   Support increased abundance and diversity of native species in various South San Francisco Bay aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem components including plants invertebrates fish mammals birds reptiles and amphibians. 2. Maintain or improve existing levels of flood protection in the South Bay area. 3. Provide public access and recreational opportunities compatible with wildlife and habitat goals. 4. Protect or improve existing levels of water and sediment quality in the South Bay and take into account ecological risks caused by restoration. 5. Implement design and management measures to maintain or improve current levels of vector management control predation on special status species and manage the spread of non-native invasive species. 6. Protect the services provided by existing infrastructure (e.g. power lines railroads). The partner agencies are undertaking these two closely linked efforts the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project and the South San Francisco Bay Shoreline Study to plan and implement habitat restoration flood management and public access for the 15100 acres of salt ponds and adjacent lands in order to improve the South Bay for wildlife and people. ","Project Need: The San Francisco Bay has lost an estimated 80 to 90 percent of its historic wetlands to fill or alteration and very little high-quality tidal salt marsh habitat remains in the South Bay. A large proportion of the remaining undeveloped land is comprised of salt production ponds which have been a dominant component of the South Bay landscape for over a century and support a suite of waterbirds that has become adapted to their presence. The 2003 acquisition of the SBSP restoration project area provided land managers with an opportunity to reverse the dramatic decline in populations of marsh-dependent fish and wildlife by restoring significant amounts of tidal wetlands. In addition many Bay-side communities are at risk from tidal and fluvial flooding. Restoration of tidal marshes in conjunction with new flood protection infrastructure can provide a more sustainable approach to protecting these communities in the face of sea-level rise. A third goal of South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project is to provide public access to restored areas which are centrally located to the majority of the Bay Area s 7.5 million inhabitants. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Possible without project consequences include increased vulnerability to tidal flooding of South Bay communities and continued decline of endangered species dependent upon tidal marsh habitat. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) Tidal marsh restoration will increase the residence time of outgoing fluvial waters thereby increasing the residence time of stormwater in the marshes. This helps contribute to both surface storage and groundwater recharge. ii. Water Quality Increased mash habitat enhancing the ability of the baylands habitats to filter pollutants from point and non-point sources thus improving the overall water quality of the Bay. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Removal of levees resulting from tidal marsh restoration allows for outgoing flood waters to enter the baylands habitats sooner. This helps alleviate upstream flood risks. In addition restored marshes act as a buffer against tidal flooding increasing the efficacy of existing flood protection levees. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) Habitat improvements for a variety of fish and wildlife species including the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse California clapper rail and Central Valley spring-run chinook as well as the threatened Central California Coast steelhead (Distinct Population Segment) and the North American green sturgeon. In addition to habitat restoration goals the project is also including several public access features including new Bay Trail segments and interpretive features adjacent to San Francisco Bay.

","Detailed description: The purpose of the Goat Island Marsh Restoration Project is to reinitiate tidal flows to the site and to reestablish characteristic marsh feature (ponds pannes and SAV areas) and vegetation. The main project actions include creating an oversized channel lowering the perimeter levee and expanding existing SAV ponds active weed control and native species revegetation and replacing the levee trail with an interpretive nature trail and boardwalk. Restoration Features Tidal marsh restoration features (Figure 1.2)   Construction of Tidal Channel & Channel Bank High Marsh Habitat Excavate an oversized (larger than the theoretical equilibrium cross-section for the initial tidal prism) breach and main  trunk  channel sized to prevent tidal choking (constriction of tidal flow restriction of the basin s tidal prism). Use spoils from excavation to construct side cast ridges and actively revegetate these areas with competitive native perennial high brackish marsh species to preempt rapid invasion of Lepidium latifolium and actively remove pioneer (incipient) small colonies of L. latifolium until native vegetation establishes closed canopy cover.   Construction of Branch Channels. Improve or establish post-restoration circulation in the new channel via one of the following means: o If excavation of branch channels (channels branching from the main trunk channel) is cost-effective then construct highly sinuous and irregular branch channels in selected areas of the subsided marsh plain patterned after historical tidal channels or local reference channels. o If excavation/dredging is not cost effective mow or macerate tule-cattail bulrush in existing subsided diked marsh channels.   Levee Lowering & Channel Bank Vegetation Enhancement. o Grade exterior levee to elevation not exceeding 1 ft above MHHW or the maximum reference elevation of adjacent Rush Landing fringing high marsh (whichever is higher). o Cover recontoured levee with peat/mud \"topsoils\" excavated from weed free borrow pits in marsh plain. o Grade out levee thickets of Himalayan blackberry placing spoils on the inboard side of the levees to widen the side slopes. The spoils should be placed at elevations such that blackberry roots/stems are completely submerged by daily tides (below MHHW) after restoration. o Remove Phragmites place as backfill in peat/mud borrow pits to submerge weed residue. o Salinize soils on the recontoured levee by irrigating with brackish water during first year post-construction and revegetate with native vegetation.   Expand pond/SAV areas within the marsh by mowing or macerating (using amphibious weed removal equipment) portions of the existing tule/cattail/bulrush marsh bordering the ponds at the mouth of the Suisun Hill Hollow drainage and the SE corner of Goat Island Marsh. The mowing/maceration will help to reduce the regeneration of tall emergent brackish marsh in these areas following tidal restoration. Public Access & Environmental Education Features This project element aims to enhance the educational experience of visitors to Rush Ranch by constructing an interpretive nature trail between the ranch headquarters and the proposed Goat Island Marsh restoration site. The interpretive nature trail is intended to provide high volume low impact visitor access to the Goat Island Marsh restoration site and associated high marsh - grassland ecotone and ameliorate closure of a one mile portion of levee trail around Goat Island Marsh (Section 4.1). Public access features include:   Nature Trail. Realignment of existing fence lines and footpaths between the preserve headquarters and Goat Island Marsh.   Boardwalks. Construction of a boardwalk footbridge wildlife viewing blind water quality sampling station interpretive signs and gathering areas to facilitate instructional use and provide a safe and attractive visitor experience.   Interpretive Signage. Interpretive signs describing ecological features of the tidal marsh and high marsh- terrestrial ecotone habitat restoration objectives and actions and describing the importance of tidal wetlands conservation in Suisun Marsh and the San Francisco Bay Estuary. ","Project Need: The intact gradual transition zone between tidal slough marsh and uplands at Rush Ranch is one of the most unique and ecologically important features of the preserve. Whereas tidal marshes are threatened with complete inundation throughout much of the SF Bay Estuary the connectivity between marsh and terrestrial habitat at Rush Ranch provides the possibility for estuarine transgression whereby marsh and transitional habitat can migrate upslope in response to sea level rise. Current estimates for the rate of sea level rise in the SF Bay estuary are predicted to be in the range of 26-55 inches by 2100 resulting in increasing water depth and in higher salinity. Climate change is also predicted to bring higher average temperatures and an increase in the severity of storms. In addition to sea level rise Rush Ranch will be impacted by salinity intrusion as sea level rises throughout the Bay Area. Salinity intrusions will likely result in changes in the composition and structure of the plant community with cascading effects in throughout the food chain. While the ecological changes brought about by sea level rise and climate change are difficult to predict the gradual transition zone at Rush Ranch presents one of the best opportunities for inward migration of marsh habitat and also provides an excellent opportunity to monitor the effects of sea level rise and salinity intrusion as it occurs. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the project does not occur the site will continue to function at a low ecological level with limited benefits to endangered species. The levee will deteriorate and the Marsh Trail will be closed. Eventually unplanned inundation of the wetland will occur and the opportunity for to establish site elevations suitable for sediment accretion and resilience in the face of climate change will be lost resulting in a low-functioning tidal marsh with serious weed problems and no public access 20-30 years down the road. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality 80 acres of stagnant muted marsh will be converted to daily tidal flushing over restored marsh habitat. iii.

","Project Type Description: As a water conservation project rain water will be captured and stored in large volume cisterns on campuses. These cisterns will be sized to capture the amount of water needed for both indoor reuse (toilet flushing throughout the school year) and outdoor reuse (landscape and school garden irrigation). This effort will conserve potable water resources and significantly reduce stormwater runoff volumes. Additional stormwater runoff volume reductions will be achieved by retrofitting select areas of campuses with LID measures such as bio-swales rain gardens and permeable paving which all promote stormwater detention and groundwater recharge. These surface-level stormwater management approaches also provide water quality benefits by naturally filtering out pollutants prior to discharge into existing storm drain pipelines and waterways. Associated vegetation will beautify the campuses and create wildlife habitat within a highly developed urban context. Quantified costs and benefits examples of institutional barriers and workable solutions will be developed as informational pieces for decision-makers and reference documents for stakeholders to assist in the formalization of these approaches within Bay Area school districts. ","Detailed description: Unified school districts operate and manage numerous publically-owned facilities that contribute untreated urban stormwater runoff to local waterways and ultimately the San Francisco Bay. This pilot project will design and install Low Impact Development-based stormwater treatment facilities and large scale rain water catchment for indoor and outdoor reuse at three school campuses in three disadvantaged communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. The San Francisco Estuary Partnership has identified the West Contra Costa County Oakland and San Francisco Unified School Districts as viable partners due to their recent experiences pursuing these approaches. As a capacity building effort this project will monitor the costs and benefits of the improvements including quantification of pollutants captured gallons of potable water conserved and costs of maintenance activities. The project will produce a report describing institutional barriers encountered successful solutions and recommendations for institutionalizing LID approaches in school districts. These findings will be presented to School District Boards Principals Parent Teacher Associations and Facilities Managers. ","Project Need: Urbanized watersheds contribute significantly more stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution than in pre-developed conditions. This results in degradation of local waterbodies and over-loading of existing storm drain inlets and pipelines. Low impact development (LID) and rain water harvesting are innovative approaches that reduce these impacts and conserve potable water while providing ancillary benefits such as beautification heat island reductions and stewardship opportunities. This project focuses on public school grounds which generally have ample space for LID retrofits and year-round needs for non-potable water use. School campuses are ideal pilot project locations because educational activities can be integrated into the projects. Project success and challenges will be documented and analyzed to produce materials that can be used to help formalize LID and rain water reuse as standard faciltiy improvement considerations. Acceptance and increased use of LID and rain water harvesting by school institutions would magnify their beneifts as decentralized approaches and inspire others to follow. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the proposal is not implemented school facility design and managment will likely remain as it currently exists. Opportunities for integrating innovative water conservation and stormwater management improvements will be limited to schools with internal and external environmental champions. This may result in a number of exceptional projects but likely more opportunities will be missed even as school districts appeal to voters for facility improvements through bond measures. Potable water will continue to be used for non-potable uses which will further strain water supplies and reliability. Polluted runoff will continue to wash off school grounds into pipes that lead to local waterbodies. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) Three schools will be outfitted with large-volume cisterns for rain water capture and reuse. The sizing of the cisterns will be based on each site's specific non-potable water use budget (total water needs for toilet flushing and outdoor irrigation). There may be ancillary groundwater recharge benefits associated with LID stormwater treatment measures. ii. Water Quality LID measures at each site will provide natural treatment of urban runoff by filtering and breaking down pollutants. Bioretention measures have been shown to effectively reduce common stormwater contaminents such as heavy metals polyaromatic hydrocarbons and suspended sediments. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Both the LID stromwater treatment measures and rain water catchment systems will reduce stormwater runoff volumes and velocities which will reduce localized flooding risks. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The LID stormwater treatment measures will create green spaces on school campuses which can attract local wildlife and provide stewardship and educational opportunities at each site.

","Detailed description: Lagunitas Creek supports the largest and most stable population of endangered coho salmon in Central California; it also supports a robust population of threatened steelhead trout. Survival of juvenile coho and steelhead through the winter could be improved by enhancing high flow refuge habitat both in- and off-channel and by enhancing pool and run habitats in the creek to allow for higher densities of fish coho at winter base flows. Winter habitat enhancement can be achieved through one or all of three approaches: creating and reconnecting side channels and backwaters within the floodplain that salmonids could access during high flow events; installing large wood structures that would provide backwater eddies as flow refuge; and installing cross-channel large wood structures at creek constrictions that would back up water and inundate the floodplain at lower flows as well as provide in-stream cover and deepen pools. MMWD is currently conducting an assessment to identify site specific locations for these types of winter habitat enhancement features. The assessment will conclude with the completion of 100% engineered drawings suitable for bidding and construction.This project will implement the construction of up to eight winter habitat enhancement features developed in the current winter habitat assessment that MMWD is conducting.

Prior to implementing construction environmental review work will be completed to include CEQA and all permitting. ","Project Need: The Lagunitas Limiting Factors Analysis (Stillwater Sciences 2008) identified winter habitat as the limiting factor for both coho salmon and steelhead populations in the Lagunitas Creek watershed. Fall juvenile and spring smolt survey data indicate dramatic declines in the numbers of juvenile coho during the winter months. Whether these declines are due to in-stream mortality or early emigration of coho smolts to the ocean (prior to smolt surveys commencing) is under investigation. It is hypothesized that winter habitat in Lagunitas Creek is limited during base flow to bank-full periods.

","Project Type Description: Drinking Water Supply: Infiltration for groundwater recharge - adding reliability to local water supply Water Quality Improvement: Stormwater filtration recharge to offset salinity intrusion repair of sewer crossings to avoid sanitation spills Stormwater Improvements: Diversion of culverted flows and other stormwater to infiltration facilities; reduction in flood hazards through detention repair of sewer crossings to avoid sanitation spills Groundwater Benefits: Infiltration for recharge recharge to offset salinity intrusion Infiltration: Combined detention/infiltration facilities; diversion of culverted flows to infiltration facilities Habitat Protection and Restoration: Elimination or mitigation of fish passage barriers; stream habitat enhancement and restoration; removal of invasive plants; tidal wetlands restoration Flood Protection: Detention to attenuate flood peaks storm drain modifications floodplain restoration tidal wetlands restoration stream restoration and maintenance Related to a Disadvantaged Community: Flood hazard reduction projects and LID program in which DAC benefits are prioritized ","Detailed description: The Sonoma Valley Integrated Water Management Program is an inter-related suite of initiatives that will address flood hazard reduction water supply water quality habitat and ecosystem function and climate change resilience goals within the Sonoma Valley. A primary impetus for this effort was the development of the Sonoma Valley Groundwater Management Plan (GWMP) a voluntary non-regulatory plan that identifies actions needed to develop sustainable groundwater supplies in the Sonoma Valley. In addition the December 31 2005 flood of record in the Sonoma Creek basin was a catalyst in heightening local awareness of existing flood hazards and the need to develop a reliable foundation for land use and flood management planning as several million dollars  worth of damage was incurred including $2.4 million in the City of Sonoma. This program identifies a set of specific multi-objective projects (City of Sonoma Adobe Canyon) as well as program components to address flood hazards within Sonoma Valley. Both the GWMP and the flood event were influential in triggering the development of the Sonoma Valley Stormwater Management and Groundwater Recharge Study (2012) an effort by the Sonoma County Water Agency (SCWA) that prompted the development of this program and many of its specific project elements. Most of the Sonoma Creek watershed is designated as Critical Habitat for Central Coast Steelhead (NOAA) and is listed as water quality-impaired for sediment (RWQCB). The opportunities to enhance Sonoma Creek and its tributaries so as to make real differences for water quality and this federally-listed threatened species are tremendous in this relatively rural watershed tributary to San Francisco Bay. Public access and education will be integrated into many of the component projects. The off-line surface water basins for combined flood detention and groundwater recharge that are located on public and park open space lands will include public access and interpretive features. The rural and urban lands stormwater management programs are explicitly focused on public education through demonstration projects workshops and development of educational and technical support materials. Other projects such as the Stuart Run fish passage barrier removal include development of a new small park with ample opportunity to explain the role of the project in the recovery of the Central Coast Steelhead and educate visitors on the status of Steelhead in the watershed and the challenges faced by this iconic native fish. Any land or easement acquisition required for implementation of specific projects undertaken as part of this program will be undertaken with willing sellers only. Program components include the following: Flood hazard reduction   development and implementation of flood management projects with a priority on projects to benefit DACsDual-purpose flood hazard reduction/groundwater recharge facilities   offline basins or underground infiltration facilitiesImprovements to existing stormwater management systems   retrofitting for infiltration replacement of undersized facilities rerouting of excess stormflowUrban stormwater management program   Low-Impact Development (LID) demonstration education and technical support with a priority on including efforts and projects that will benefit DACsRural lands stormwater management and habitat enhancement   Implementation demonstration education and technical supportEnhanced conjunctive use capacity   water supply wells and associated distribution facilities stormwater infiltration facilitiesFish passage barrier removal   modifications or removal of structures impeding passageTidal wetlands restoration   recreation of tidal marshes for habitat flood hazard reduction and climate change resilienceStream restoration and maintenance   recontouring to support water quality enhancement and restore ecosystem processes revegetation with native species invasive plant removalErosion management   slope and channel stabilization to reduce the supply of fine sedimentSewer stream crossings assessment and protection   protect water quality by reducing the risk of damage to vulnerable sanitary sewer pipelines at stream crossings.

With population growth flood risks have increased as people have developed and moved into floodplains increasing runoff and creating hydraulic constraints in stream channels (e.g. bridges). With development has come significant impacts to native species habitat and to the water quality of the creeks draining the Sonoma Valley. Additional problems include groundwater aquifer decline flooding and sedimentation resulting from changes to runoff patterns dependence on water imported from the Russian River and severe declines in riparian forest anadromous steelhead and salmon and other aquatic-dependent species and habitats. The effects of climate change and the threat of a rise in sea level would compound existing problems. People in Sonoma Valley are highly concerned about water supply and water quality but generally they do not realize how their everyday actions affect water conditions.. There has been a significant increase in irrigated agriculture predominantly vineyards which rely heavily on groundwater. Groundwater levels have declined in some portions of the Sonoma Valley due to increased localized groundwater withdrawals. Cones of depression have developed in areas southeast of the City of Sonoma and southwest of El Verano. A study by the USGS (2006) showed a moderate but persistent average annual net loss in aquifer storage in recent decades on the order of 1000 af. Declines in groundwater level may result in increased extraction costs possible well deepening or replacements costs possible groundwater quality degradation including salinity intrusion potential land subsidence decreases in streamflow and environmental damage. Climate change is expected to lead to greater variability in precipitation levels and a possible shortening of the precipitation season. As a result the need for an effective conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater systems will grow. The Sonoma Valley Integrated Water Management Program will provide both flood hazard reduction and groundwater recharge benefits. It will enhance water supply water quality and habitat in the Sonoma Valley while promoting resilience to climate change. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the proposed Sonoma Valley Integrated Water Management Program is not implemented flooding will worsen and cause damage even during small storms groundwater levels will continue to decline at their present rate impaired water quality will persist and the City of Sonoma s municipal water supply well will continue to deteriorate becoming less reliable. The threatened Central Coast Steelhead population will continue to be unable to access identified critical habitat in the Sonoma Creek watershed and waterways will become increasingly vulnerable to wastewater discharges resulting from damaged sewer pipelines. Declining groundwater levels will cause impacts to the local community and to the environment. The cost to extract groundwater will increase as groundwater levels decline. Wells will need to be drilled deeper into the aquifer or replaced entirely. Groundwater quality will also decline evidenced by salinity intrusion decreases in streamflow and environmental ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) Combined flood detention and groundwater recharge facilities which will capture and detain/retain storm water surface runoff and storm drain diversion will enhance infiltration to the groundwater aquifer. Groundwater recharge will be promoted in a manner to maximize passive infiltration to the deep zone aquifer   offsetting in some measure the effects of a declining groundwater table and saline intrusion migrating up-valley from the San Pablo Bay. Replacing and relocating the old City of Sonoma well will improve the reliability of the local municipal water supply and proactively respond to the effects of saline groundwater intrusion within the city watersheds. Improvements to the stormwater management systems will enhance natural recharge including restoration of flow from a spring that has been diverted into the stormdrain system in the City of Sonoma. Enhanced recharge from storage facilities and stormwater system retrofits will help to increase groundwater storage and/or reduce reliance on imported water. ii. Water Quality Water quality enhancements will occur under the Sonoma Valley Integrated Water Management Program through groundwater recharge projects promotion of improved stormwater management techniques on urban and rural lands reduction of sediment source supply to watershed drainages (e.g. through channel stabilization replacement of a bridge in Sugarloaf State Park that promotes severe scour and through treatment of severe upslope erosion sites). The groundwater recharge promoted by detention facilities will be designed to maximize passive infiltration to the deep zone aquifer offsetting in some measure the effects of a declining groundwater table and saline intrusion migrating up-valley from the San Pablo Bay. Stormwater management programs to demonstrate promote and support water management techniques to reduce or eliminate hydromodification effects of development on both urban and rural lands will also enhance water quality. The protection of sewer stream crossings will minimize the environmental and public health hazards of raw sewage spills. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management The Sonoma Valley Integrated Water Management Program includes a program element specifically directed towards flood hazard analysis and flood management project development and implementation. The outdated and piecemeal floodplain studies for Sonoma Creek and its tributaries will be replaced by coherent analyses and subsequent project designs based on current data and a more integrative and multi-objective approach to flood management planning. Measures to be implemented in the City of Sonoma will reduce flood hazards along Fryer and Nathanson Creeks. The combined flood detention and groundwater recharge facilities will capture and detain/retain direct stormwater surface runoff and stormdrain diversion. Replacement of the existing Fryer Creek Culvert Crossing beneath MacArthur Avenue in the City of Sonoma will increase conveyance and work in combination with the detention/recharge basins to provide 10- year flood protection to most of the drainage and incremental benefits to the Nathanson Creek drainage. The floodplain restoration project on Lower Fryer and Lower Nathanson Creeks will reduce flood elevations upstream improving the effectiveness of upstream detention projects. Lastly modifications to the stormdrain system will reduce the effects of undersized infrastructure and enhance infiltration opportunities thereby further reducing flood hazards. Combined detention/recharge facilities in the upper Sonoma Creek watershed will reduce flood peaks downstream along the creek. The Adobe Canyon project will use a combination of sediment removal channel modification and other measures to reduce flood damages at the outlet of Adobe Canyon in Kenwood. Stream maintenance activities will improve flood conveyance by removing invasive plants addressing sediment deposits that create problematic flow constrictions while preserving habitat complexity and selectively pruning or removing vegetation that blocks the active flow area of the channel. Tidal marsh restoration will reduce flood hazards by changing land uses to those that are compatible with flooding and will provide a buffer to the flooding and erosion hazards associated with sea level rise. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) Most of the components of the proposed Sonoma Valley Integrated Water Management Program will integrate one or more aspects of resource stewardship. The program as a whole is a set of activities directed towards watershed management. The off-line detention/recharge basins will largely be sited on public lands including parks and athletic fields. These projects will provide tangible opportunities for the community to learn first-hand about watershed management. Habitat protection and restoration are part of the stream maintenance practices including the removal of invasive plant species and revegetation with native species. Enhancement of groundwater recharge through stormwater management and the focused recharge facilities will enhance the delivery of groundwater to stream channels and promote a more natural flood flow hydrograph in Sonoma Creek (e.g. extended receding limb of the hydrograph). Removal of fish passage barriers and restoration of stream channels and tidal wetlands will directly provide habitat benefits for listed and other species. Tidal wetlands restoration will also provide carbon sequestration as marsh vegetation develops and becomes buried in sediments with the anticipated rise in sea level.

Diversion Dam is 2 miles downstream Milliken Creek with Water Treatment Plant an additional mile downstream. ","Project Type Description: ","Detailed description: The project involves automation and telemetry of existing outflow release valves at the base of Milliken Reservoir and Milliken Diversion Dam 1.75 miles downstream of the reservoir. The current reservoir release valve can only be accessed after a 30-minute drive and walk to the diversion dam. Limited access and control of this valve does not afford precise control of the flow released from the water body. The project will install an inflatable dam or increase the stability of the existing dam at the current diversion dam site sufficient to retain the amount of pulsed water during a treatment plant filter run. Automation of the reservoir release valve and diversion dam release valve in addition to the increased capacity of the downstream point of diversion will allow control and consequently consistent volume of the flow of water below the existing dams. This automation will result in improved water quality due to the controllable flows to the treatment plant consistent habitat downstream and better recharge through alluvial formations. ","Project Need: This project will recover water supply that is currently released due to inability to throttle flows on a reasonable time frame. Automation of this system will greatly increase the operational efficiency and management of this long term water supply. The increased efficiency equates to new water supply thereby negating the need for the next increment of water supply while increasing the reliability of existing supplies. Better and more efficient operation of this water supply provides consistent flow in the creek thereby creating a more natural state of flows for habitat. If this operation did not exist there would be no habitat in this creek channel during many months of the year. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Long term inefficiency of the use of water supply resulting in greater demands on other water supplies in the region. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) Efficient use of existing water supplies is a benefit because it avoids the added increment and increases reliability and sustainability within the current portfolio of the City's supplies. Barring infrastructure failures or emergencies the added increment of water to the City of Napa system could be substituted for the equivalent amount of State Water Project water imported from the Delta in a given year. ii. Water Quality Water quality is improved by allowing consistent flow to the existing treatment plant therefore blending of the highest quality water into the City system. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) Resource stewardship is benefited by the consistency of the flows in the watershed during the summer months which will support habitat in a more sustainable manner than historically due to the current lack of precision in the controls of flows beyond the reservoir and downstream at the diversion dam.

This expansion will include 31830 LF of new pipeline and will bring several large parks schools and golf courses onto recycled water reducing demand on the potable water system supplying 641000 gallons per day of recycled water during peak months. Phase 1 is currently under design by a consulting firm and includes 10130 LF of recycled water pipeline that will serve the Milpitas Sports Complex Cardoza Park Milpitas Unified District Office William Burnett Elementary School Robert Randall Elementary School and I-680/SR-237 interchange landscaping. The alignment travels down Edsel Drive Dempsey Road East Calaveras Blvd down a private driveway and through a sports complex and down Kennedy Drive. In addition the pipeline crosses I-680 and travels west in Los Coches St to Hillview Drive. Phase 2 extends the recycled water line approximately 8200 LF from Edsel Dr. and Perry St. to Roswell Dr. at Ashland Dr. to the north and Yellowstone at Tahoe Dr. to the South. Phase 2 will serve the following sites with recycled water: Alexander Rose Elementary School Martin Murphy Elementary School Foothills Park Murphy Park and Robert E. Browne Park. Phase 3 extends the recycled water line approximately 13500 LF via two easterly branches.

The Westside Recycled Water Project includes the design and construction of a new treatment facility (to be located at the SFPUC s Oceanside Wastewater Treatment Plant) a new recycled water storage reservoir and pump station in Golden Gate Park and approximately 8.5 miles of new pipeline to deliver recycled water to its customers. The Panhandle Pipeline is approximately 4800 linear feet of new 8-inch diameter pipeline that will connect the Panhandle to the irrigation pipeline loop in Golden Gate Park. The Panhandle is currently using potable water from the Regional Water System for irrigation. Providing recycled water for irrigation of the Panhandle is expected to save approximately 42 AFY of potable water. Environmental Review and Permitting The SFPUC is managing the Environmental Review process which involves the preparation of an Environmental Impact Report. The Notice of Preparation/Initial Study is currently being prepared and is anticipated to be released in late May 2014. The Draft Environmental Impact Report is anticipated to be released in November 2014 and certified in July 2015. There are no environmental permits anticipated for the project. However the project will need to be reviewed by the California Coastal Commission for consistency with their plans and policies; this review is anticipated to be completed by September 2015. This project is a city-wide project that does not specifically target but is inclusive of disadvantage communities within San Francisco. The additional supplies provided by this project will benefit these communities.

","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Recycled water is a critical element of the SFPUC's 10 mgd reduction goal. If this project is not implemented the SFPUC may not achieve it's goal jeopardizing the SFPUC's ability to meet it's potable water demands which could lead to more water rationing. ","Project Benefits: The Panhandle Pipeline Project will achieve multiple benefits including increasing water supply reliability and the delivery of safe drinking water increasing local supply groundwater management and drinking water treatment and distribution. In addition as California is currently facing a severe drought this project will reduce reliance on local and imported water supplies thus helping to provide immediate and long-term drought relief. This project's benefits include supplying an annual average of 42 AFY of recycled water which will offset the need to obtain this amount from the Hetch Hetchy Regional Water System. This recycled water supply would diversify San Francisco's water supply sources and in turn increase the reliability and allow more flexible operation of the water system in particular during drought periods and emergency situations. Implementation of this project will add to the water supply reliability of the region and the state by producing recycled water to offset potable and groundwater use. This project enhances the region's ability to address climate change impacts through adaptive management; creates additional water supply for the region that is not directly from a Delta supply; frees up groundwater to be used for supplemental potable water supplies; reduces ocean discharges from the Oceanside Water Pollution Control Facility.

"99 ","East Palo Alto Groundwater Supply Conjunctive Use Project ","This Project includes the development and use of groundwater as a new source of supply for the City of East Palo Alto through: (1) the design and construction of a new municipal groundwater supply well (New Well) and treatment system and (2) the design and construction of a treatment system at the City s currently-inactive Gloria Way Well. ","('South Bay'; 'West Bay') | San Mateo and Santa Clara ","37.457607 | -122.134836 ","12/01/2012 ","7/31/2017 ","The Project will be located in the City of East Palo Alto which is located in Southern San Mateo County or the  West Bay  sub-region as identified in the Bay Area IRWMP. The New Well will be located at the corner of Clarke Road and East Bayshore Drive. The Gloria Way Well is located at the intersection of Bay Road and Gloria Way. The City overlies DWR Basin (2-9.03) the San Mateo Plain Groundwater Subbasin which is part of the larger Santa Clara Basin. ","Project Type Description: DRINKING WATER SUPPLY: This project will add between 800 to 1200 AFY of new potable supply to the City. This will increase and diversify the supply available to the City including during droughts. Furthermore the addition of two wells to the City will: (1) provide the City with  effective  emergency storage (of which it currently has none); (2) provide the City with an alternate potable supply source when there are supply interruptions or water quality breaches on the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) Regional System (e.g. as occurred on March 3 2015); and (3) increase system pressures to meet fire flow requirements in the DAC portions of the City where there are currently insufficient fire flows and system pressures that are regularly as low as 20 psi. WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT: The treatment systems that will be developed to treat the produced groundwater at the New Well and the Gloria Way Well will ensure that the groundwater that enters the City's water distribution system meets all primary and secondary MCLs. Furthermore the addition of these two wells will ensure that the City has an alternate source of potable supply to rely on when water quality breaches occur on the SFPUC Regional System (e.g. as occurred on March 3 2015). GROUNDWATER BENEFITS: As part of this Project the City is working with other Basin users to develop a Groundwater Management Plan (GWMP) that will ensure the long-term sustainability of the San Mateo Plain Groundwater Subbasin. ","Detailed description: Description: This Project includes the development of groundwater as a new supply source for the City through the design and construction of: (1) a New Well and treatment system; and (2) a treatment system at the City s currently-inactive Gloria Way Well. This Project will result in 800 to 1200 AFY of new supply to the City and will address major public health and safety and economic issues that have local and regional impacts. Benefits to a DAC: This Project will develop local groundwater for conjunctive use to increase public safety improve emergency preparedness provide drought relief and increase water supply reliability within the DAC portion of the City. Every census tract within the City is considered a DAC and 79% of the residents are low-income. Readiness to Proceed: As part of its work to construct a New Well and treatment system the City conducted a 2012 Groundwater Feasibility Study and constructed a pilot well conducted aquifer pump testing and collected soil and groundwater samples in 2014. Design of the well and treatment system will be completed by April 2016 with construction completed by July 2017. The Gloria Way Well was constructed in 1981. Use of the well ceased shortly thereafter due to elevated concentrations of manganese in the produced water. The City completed a series of studies (2012 Groundwater Feasibility Study and an approved 2013 CEQA/NEPA document) that identify the benefits of bringing the Gloria Way Well back on-line with the addition of a treatment system. Design of the treatment system will be completed by June 2015 with construction completed by September 2016. Function/Physical Benefits: This Project provides a supplemental supply source that will make the City more resilient during droughts provide for economic growth and create a buffer against impacts from cutbacks outages and water quality incidents on the SFPUC regional system. Such an incident occurred on March 3 2015 wherein untreated water was introduced into the SFPUC regional system. Due to lack of system storage or alternative supplies the City was forced to provide untreated water to customers. In this instance no public health issues were noted; however a more catastrophic incident would result in a public health crisis. Further the location of the wells in the City s distribution system will add water and boost system pressures to the DAC portions of the City that currently are plagued by low pressures (i.e. regularly as low as 20 psi) and where adequate fire flow cannot be provided creating a public health and safety risk. Coordination/Collaboration: The City is developing this Project with support from agencies and stakeholders including the Bay Area Water Supply and Conservation Agency (BAWSCA) Santa Clara Valley Water District Alameda County Water District SFPUC San Mateo County Palo Alto Menlo Park Foster City Town of Atherton Tuolomne River Trust Palo Alto Park Mutual Water Company and O'Conner Tract Co-op Water Company. The City is committed to working with stakeholders to effectively manage and protect the groundwater basin. The City s GWMP will be completed by December 2015. ","Project Need: As is described in more detail below the City has multiple water supply needs that will be addressed by this Project: The City has one of the lowest residential per capita water uses in the State (51 R GPCD) which makes drought cutbacks difficult to achieve; The City uses more than its contractual allocation from the SFPUC regional system which means that it cannot support any additional economic development; The City has a single source of supply and no emergency storage which makes it vulnerable to supply interruptions and water quality breaches; and The City cannot currently meet fire flow requirements in large portions of DAC neighborhoods within the City which creates a major public health and safety issue. WATER SUPPLY NEED: The City has a single source of water   a supply allocation of 1.94 million gallons per day (MGD) that it has from the SFPUC regional system which is relied upon by 26 other agencies. The City s current demand meets or exceed its supply allocation which means that it cannot approve any additional economic development. Furthermore due to the current drought conditions the SFPUC regional system supply is constrained and deliveries from this system could be reduced by as much as 20% during future dry years. Based on the projections in the City's current Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) the City's normal year supply deficit will be 1200 AFY by 2030; drought shortfalls will be even greater. This Project will increase the City s water supply by 800 to 1200 AFY and thus will augment the City s water supply portfolio in both normal and dry years. DROUGHT RELIEF NEED: Currently the City s customers use approximately 51 R-GPCD which means that during a significant drought and cutbacks to its SFPUC regional system supply they have limited ability to reduce their consumption. This Project will provide the City with a supplemental source of supply which will create a buffer for the City during droughts such as the one that we are currently experiencing. Further since the City will have an alternative supply that it can rely on during normal and drought years this Project will reduce the City s reliance on the SFPUC regional system which benefits the region and the Delta. WATER QUALITY NEED: The City currently does not have any storage tanks or alternative supplies that can provide a source of treated water during emergencies or other supply disruptions which makes the City and its customers extremely vulnerable. For example on March 3 2015 the SFPUC released untreated water to the regional system which the City had no choice but to serve to its customers. This Project will provide the City and its customers with an alternative source of high-quality potable water that is can use during emergencies and other supply interruptions. PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY NEED: In large portions of the City and particularly in the DAC portions of the City system pressures are routinely as low as 20 psi. This means that if there were to be a fire or other emergency the City would not be able to provide sufficient fire flow to address the emergency situation. This creates a major public health and safety issue for the City its customers and the region. This Project will add additional water supply points near the DAC neighborhoods that could address a number of these issues by augmenting supply and maintaining system pressure in that area during peak demand periods or in the event of a fire. ECONOMIC NEED: Every census tract within the City is considered a DAC and 79% of the residents are considered low-income. The current unemployment rate is 10.1% according to the California Employment Development Department s October 2014 report which is much greater than the County-wide unemployment rate of 4.1% and the State s average of 7%. The current cost to purchase water from the SFPUC regional system is $1900 per acre-foot. In contrast the cost for the City to produce groundwater is approximately $400 per acre-foot. Over a 20-year period development of groundwater will save the City $36000000. By lowering the cost of the City s water supply this Project will greatly benefit the City s customers especially those in the DAC neighborhoods. Further additional supply will allow the City to approve additional economic development within the City which has millions of dollars of local and regional benefits. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Water Supply Impact: Without an additional supply source the City will have to either: (1) purchase water from the SFPUC regional system in volumes above its contractual entitlement or (2) cease economic development. Both scenarios create significant impacts locally and regionally. This Project will add 800 to 1200 AFY of additional supply to support economic development within the City and the region. Drought Impact: The City is currently 100% dependent upon the SFPUC regional system which can reduce deliveries by over 20% during dry years creating a supply shortfall for the City of over 700 AFY. The City has limited ability to conserve during a drought without significant economic hardship due to its already low residential water use (51 R-GPCD). This Project will add additional supply of 800 to 1200 AFY that would provide drought relief. Water Quality Impact: The City lacks significant water reliability and security in the event of a water quality event on the SFPUC regional system. For example on March 3 2015 the SFPUC released untreated water to the regional system which the City had no choice but to serve to its customers. This Project will provide the City with an alternative source of water that it can use during emergencies and other supply interruptions. Public Health and Safety Impact: The City s distribution system lacks sufficient storage and redundancy to provide a secure water supply to major portions of the City during an emergency and is unreliable during peak demand periods (i.e. system pressures are routinely as low as 20 psi in the DAC portion of the City). Without this Project the City will remain extremely vulnerable to fire and emergency situations. This creates a major public health and safety issue for the City and the region. This Project will add additional water supply points near the DAC neighborhoods that addresses these issues by augmenting supply and maintaining system pressures during peak demand periods or in the event of an emergency. Economic Impact: This Project provides a highly-reliable and cost-effective source of water to the City and its DAC customers. Without this Project the City will be forced to purchase additional water from the SFPUC regional system at a cost of at least $1900 per acre-foot rather than developing groundwater at a cost of $400 per acre-foot. Over a 20-year period development of groundwater will save the City $36000000. Furthermore without this Project the City does not have sufficient water supply to support further economic development within the City to great economic impact - locally and regionally. ","Project Benefits: By adding additional local and drought-proof supply sources this Project achieves the following immediate benefits that are consistent with State and regional priorities: Immediate drought preparedness and Increases local water supply reliability and the delivery of safe drinking water. The Project will provide an additional 800 to 1200 AFY of new water supply to the City and by extension the region during normal and drought years. It will allow the City to reduce the amount of water it purchases from the SFPUC system and instead will allow the City to cost-effectively produce its own water. Further because this Project will develop new supplies for the City it will provide for future economic growth with significant economic benefits locally and to the region.Increases local water supply reliability and the delivery of safe drinking water. The Project will provide 800 to 1200 AFY of emergency treated water supply for the City. Currently the City has no emergency water supplies available in the event of a shutdown of the SFPUC regional system or water quality incident such as the recent March 3 2015 incident. Additionally the low pressures that are routinely observed in the City s distribution system are a potential fire control hazard particularly in the high-density DAC housing areas. This Project could help to avoid the immeasurable cost of public health impacts and loss of property caused by a future incident or emergency.Groundwater management. Through the development and implementation of its CWC  10753- compliant Groundwater Management Plan the City will continue to work with other basin users to manage the San Mateo Plain Groundwater Sub-basin. The City also supports basin compliance with the CASGEM program.Improvement of water quality. By adding groundwater treatment systems the City will be able to tap into an underutilized resource and distribute 800 to 1200 AFY of high-quality water to its customers during normal conditions as well as during a water quality breaches on the SFPUC regional system.Groundwater recharge/Surface storage: In lieu of developing surface water storage this Project conjunctively uses groundwater as a source of underground storage that is available to the City during emergencies and drought years. Reduced use of groundwater during wet years will allow the basin to recharge such that groundwater is available to augment the City s supply during drought years support summer peaking demands and provide water in the event of an emergency.

","Detailed description: Gallagher Wells and Pipeline Project (Excerpt from Mitigated Negative Declaration) Project Description: NMWD proposes to install a second well at its existing Gallagher Wells site. Water from the existing well and the proposed additional well will be piped through grassland to the existing Gallagher Ranch private road/driveway and then along that road to the private bridge. The pipe will be hung from the bridge so no work would take place within Lagunitas Creek. Water will then be transported by about 4900 feet of 12-inch pipeline installed along Point Reyes-Petaluma Road to the existing Downey Well site where it would connect to the existing 6-inch pipeline that connects the Downey Well to the District's Point Reyes Treatment Plant. The pipeline proposed along Point Reyes-Petaluma Road would be within the pavement or shoulder of that road. NMWD proposes to abandon the existing Downey Well that lies within the Lagunitas Creek stream channel. The existing well head will be removed and the entire 12-inch well casing will be filled with bentonite (clay) chips pursuant to state standards. NMWD proposes to amend its Water Right 4324B and Permit 19725 to add the Gallagher Well site as a point of diversion. NMWD will petition the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to change the approved points of diversion for License 4324B from the Giacomini Ranch Coast Guard Wells and Downey Well to the Coast Guard Wells Downey Well site and the Gallagher Wells. An existing stream gauging station is located between Point Reyes-Petaluma Road and Lagunitas Creek immediately north of the Gallagher Ranch driveway. In order to gauge the streamflow downstream of the area where the existing and new Gallagher Wells would be located the District proposed the stream gauge would be relocated to a point about 1200 feet south of the existing Gallagher Well. Based on comments made by the National Park Service the existing gauge station will remain. An auxiliary gauge station will be installed about 1200 feet south of the existing Gallagher Well. This station will be operated until a study determines that a reasonable relationship between the two stations is established. This study shall also determine whether the new station would be influenced by sea level changes. If there are no long-term issues with respect to a new cross section or potential backwater effects then the existing station will be relocated to this downstream site. As allowed under California Water Code Section 1707 NMWD proposes to dedicate the water that the District can now divert under its Water Right Permit 19724 to permanent instream use. The Permit allows diversion of 212.7 acre feet of water per year (at a maximum rate of 0.699 cubic feet per second). NMWD will petition the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to change the place of use and purpose of use for 0.699 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water diverted from Lagunitas Creek under Water Right Permit 19724 for municipal uses in the NMWD West Marin Service Area for the purpose of preserving and enhancing wetland habitat and fish and wildlife resources in Lagunitas Creek pursuant to Water Code Section 1707. The new place of use is defined as instream flows for the protection preservation restoration and recovery of aquatic organisms including but not limited to coho salmon and steelhead trout pursuant to Recovery Planning measures to be developed under the Memorandum of Understanding Among National Marine Fishery Service California Department of Fish and Game Army Corps of Engineers Fish Net4C counties of Mendocino Sonoma Marin San Mateo Santa Cruz and Monterey and the County of Humboldt as executed on May 16 2002. ","Project Need: The existing NMWD Point Reyes Wells are shallow wells approximately 60 feet deep in alluvial gravels adjacent to Lagunitas Creek and Tomales Bay in Point Reyes Station CA and provide the community water supply for NMWD's West Marin Water Service Area (communities of Point Reyes Station Olema Bear Valley (including Point Reyes National Seashore) Inverness Park and Paradise Ranch Estates). There are 820 water service connections serving an approximate population of 1700 people. The NMWD Point Reyes Wells are adjacent to the tidal reach of Lagunitas Creek and subject to periodic salinity intrusion when creek flows are low and Tomales Bay tides are high. The salinity impacts drinking water quality as the existing Point Reyes Water Treatment Plant is a greensand filter process used to remove iron and manganese. The salinity intrusion increases sodium (Na) a secondary drinking water standard but an important dietary issue for certain populations and bromides which when combined with chlorine used as disinfectant in the treatment process creates disinfection by products (DPBs) a primary drinking water standard. The drinking water regualtory standards for Na and DBPs have not yet been violated but the trends are increasing and presence of the Giacomini Tidal Wetland and future sea level rise will likely exacerbate the current conditions. Additionally the existing well locations are subject to flooding when winter storms increase Lagunitas Creek flows to flood stage. Over the past 5 years total water use in the NMWD West Marin Service Area has averaged 240 acre feet per year (AFA). The District's water rights authorize 654 AFA of diversions from Lagunitas Creek (License 4324B 148.8 AFA at 0.67CFS from 5/1 thru 11/1; Permit 19724 212.7 AFA at 0.699CFS from 1/1 thru 12/31; Permit 19725 292.5 AFA at 0.961CFS from 1/1 thru 12/31). The project will enable the community water supply to be free from the potential for salinity intrusion due either to the proximity of Tomales Bay and potential sea level rise and thus avoid drinking water quality impacts. A component of the project is to dedicate water right Permit 19724 to instream flow for environmental benefit.

Flood protection will be raised from a 10% to 1% annual chance storm flow. ","Detailed description: Flooding is a common occurrence along Estudillo Canal where almost the entire watershed is urbanized. The drainage network currently provides flood protection against a 10% annual chance flood flow as opposed to FEMA s required 1% annual chance flood flow. As a result of the updated floodplain delineation an additional 1800 properties are now considered flood-prone and are required to carry flood insurance for federally backed mortgagesThe Estudillo Canal/San Leandro Flood Control Improvement Project includes three phases: construction of 14 channel capacity improvements 10 culverts seven crossing capacity enhancements and a bypass channel to reduce or eliminate flooding. The project also integrates a trail in the right-of-way along lower Estudillo Canal. Additionally there are opportunities to integrate creek daylighting as part of the overall flood control enhancements.Phase 3: Some areas of the Estudillo Canal are particularly constrained such as East 14th Street in San Leandro where residences are positioned very close to both sides of the canal with minimal setbacks. In these areas not only is the drainage capacity insufficient but the adjacent space is too narrow to accommodate expansion without infringing on private property. A flood bypass system is proposed in this area from Interstate 880 to Wicks Boulevard along Manor Boulevard to divert water during major storms. ","Project Need: Flood Control Safety: Safety is a key factor in this highly urbanized area. Currently the area experiences major flooding problems during large storms because drainage capacity throughout the watershed is significantly constrained. Flooding from a major storm event could put many people at risk of serious health and safety problems as well as incur economic hardship damage to buildings infrastructure and property inability to get to schools hospitals and other critical services and in extreme cases loss of life. Economic Loss: A major flood could force closure of businesses for extended periods of time resulting in economic hardship for individuals families and the regional economy as a whole. The project will also reclassify approximately 1800 properties outside of the 1% annual chance floodplain eliminating the need for costly FEMA flood insurance.

Water Reuse/Recycling - This project will help make Recycled Water available to customers in the developed western core of the City of Dublin. Groundwater Benefits - This project will mean that less groundwater will be pumped from local resources during the summer months and more of the imported water from the Delta may be use to recharge the local groundwater basin. ","Detailed description: The Western Dublin Recycled Water Distribution Expansion and Retrofit Program will build on and expand DSRSD's Central Dublin RW Expansion program. The Western Dublin Recycled Water will expand DSRSD's existing recycled water distribution system to deliver up to 102 acre-feet per year (AFA)or recycled water to new customers in the western part of the DSRSD service area. This project entails constructing recycled water distribution pipelines to convey water for landscape irrigation to sites which includes schools churches parks street medians and multi-family units in the already developed western area of Dublin. The pipeline routes for this infrastructure are now being studied but will extend the pipelines in the Central Dublin project. This Project will also provide plumbing retrofits to connect existing irrigation systems at the churches schools parks and medians to the recycled water system. The project will be designed to have a maximum delivery capacity of 102 AFY displacing a similar amount of potable water currently used for irrigation. ","Project Need: This Project will reduce/postpone development of new or expanded water supplies and will replace potable water currently used for irrigation and construction. The recycled water supply would also offset the water supply provided by Zone 7 Water Agency (Zone 7) from the State Water Project (SWP) which would consequently reduce diversions reduce groundwater extraction and reduce energy use (by reduced pumping). The expanded use of recycled water would also reduce the burden on existing Federal water supply facilities such as the Central Valley Project (CVP). The SWP and the CVP water contract allocations are closely inter-connected and the supply of recycled water would reduce demand and utilization of those valuable drinking water resources. Recycled Water is a drought resistant supply available all year long and can be stored in facilities already built. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Without this project there will be additional demands on the potable supplies provided by the State Water Project and the regional ground water basin. Thus DSRSD's water supply will be more reliant on the already stressed water resources. DSRSD's water supply will become less reliable in the future with less flexibility and less able to meet additional demands from continued development in our service area. Economic development in our service area will be stunted by the lack of reliable water supply. DSRSD's customers and regional customers will face their water supplies being reduced; with their water bills increasing. In the event of a state-wide drought increased pressure will be placed on the regional ground water basin; with the potential of salt water encroachment on the basin now used for potable storage. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality ... iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) ... This project will help make Recycled Water available to more customers for landscape irrigation to replace potable water formerly used for irrigation in the central and western core areas of the City of Dublin. This project will help extend a successful DERWA joint venture (DSRSD and EBMUD) bringing reycled water to new areas for additional conservation of our potable resources. Up to 102 AF per year or RW will become available. Combined with the Central Dublin Recycled Water Distribution Expansion project 347 acre-feet of potable water will be conserved. This project helps extends a program that stretches the potable water supply of the Bay/Delta region; by replacing some of the potable water from the State Water Project now used for irrigation with recycled water from DSRSD's WWTP. Also drop for drop recycled water used for irrigation is that much less water that has to be pumped out to be disposed of in San Francisco Bay. So the project will result in up to 102 AF per year LESS of WWTP effluent disposed of in the Bay and the corresponding decrease in electrical energy consumption needed to pump those volumes from the Tri-Valley area to the Bay. By reducing potable consumption this project will help DSRSD as a Water Retailer meet the 20% by 2020 potable water reduction requirements set by state law. It will also serve as a demonstration project for the beneficial uses of Recycled Water to area residents. With this successful project underway DSRSD adn DERWA will be able to bring additional Recycled Water projects to the Tri-Valley area for implementation.

"109 ","Implementation of High Priority Projects Identified in the Pilarcitos Creek Integrated Watershed Management Plan ","The purpose of the 2008 Pilarcitos Creek Integrated Watershed Management Plan (IWMP) is to promote balanced solutions to effectively manage the Pilarcitos Creek watershed that satisfy environmental public health domestic water supply and economic interests. To this end the IWMP prioritized projects that individually or collectively help to accomplish its goals. This project will implement two of the highest priority (Tier 1) actions identified in the IWMP: (1) improve rural roads throughout the watershed to reduce excessive sedimentation and hydrologic impacts and (2) fill critical data gaps to refine the water budget to help identify the potential benefits and impacts of various watershed management strategies. ","('West Bay';) | San Mateo County ","37.4748815000 -122.4479538200 "," The project will begin as soon as funding is secured. ","The project will complete within 36 months of beginning. ","The road improvement projects are located on five sections of roads in upper Pilarcitos Creek Nuff Creek Apanolio Creek and Mills Creek watersheds. The water budget development project will extend to the entire Pilarcitos Creek Watershed and its tributaries. ","Project Type Description: Improving rural roads will reduce sediment inputs and stormwater runoff rates resulting in 1) reduced stormwater flows in streams and contributions to the risk of floods 2) an increase in infiltration which will improve groundwater flows 3) improved water quality and aquatic habitat and (4) the prolonged input of groundwater to stream networks in dry periods thereby enhancing instream flow. A detailed water budget allows managers and stakeholders to quantify and identify the sources and uses of water throughout the watershed. It will help identify prioritize and forecast responses to various proposed projects in the watershed. ","Detailed description: The RCD completed assessments of over 23 miles of roads on public and private lands a significant majority of the watershed and completed implementation-ready designs for approximately 5 miles of roads deemed to be highest priorities in the assessments. The proposed treatments follow guidelines described in DFG s California Salmonid Stream Habitat Restoration Manual. They include properly sized culverts trash racks armored water crossings rock armor rolling and critical road drainage dips outsloping road segments to disperse sheet flow and inslope roads when necessary rock road surfaces to reduce sheet erosion and sediment basins to collect surface drainage and diffuse find sediment transportation. This project would implement approximately 3.5 miles of treatments resulting in an estimated reduction of 4058 yds3 of sediment delivery. The RCD will work with Coastside County Water District San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and the Pilarcitos Restoration Workgroup to address a number of large data gaps that add significant uncertainty to the existing water budget. This project component will compile and analyze available information in addition to collecting additional field data when necessary. It will estimate diversions from Pilarcitos Reservoir by SFPUC review existing long-term USGS gage data develop a surface water hydrologic model integrate surface and subsurface models estimate private diversions determine perennial flow distribution for dry years and provide data to help evaluate the volume of water necessary to maintain an open estuary for steelhead migration. A model will allow analysis of various different test scenarios to help identify the potential benefits and impacts associated with various management strategies. ","Project Need: One of the key limiting factors in identifying and evaluating water supply improvements is considerable uncertainty about the water budget for the Pilarcitos Watershed. Several of the components for such an understanding are missing. A detailed water budget allows managers and stakeholders to quantify and identify the sources and uses of water throughout the watershed guide selection of project priorities identify potential problem areas and forecast response to various proposed projects. A well-maintained water budget will also allow water supply agencies to better coordinate responses to demand needs and will support the development of improved monitoring and adaptive management tools. Erosion from rural roads contributed excess sediment that degrades fish spawning and rearing habitat and impairs bank stability and the stream s ability to carry floodwaters. NOAA s 2007 federal recovery plan for Central California Coast Steelhead identifies the need to improve rural roads. Roads also tend to have significant hydrologic effects   by routing runoff to streams rapidly peak streamflows are increased exacerbating in-stream erosion and less water can infiltrate soil thereby decreasing dry season base flows and water availability for diverse beneficial uses. Both components of this project were identified as Tier 1 or highest priority actions in the IWMP. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Without road improvements surface hydrology related to roads will not be normalized chronic delivery of sediment will continue water quality will worsen (among other impacts water quality is a potential limiting factor for estuary rearing of steelhead) steelhead rearing habitat will be lost through pool filling and channel and estuary aggradation. These impacts are related to chronic sediment delivery. Absent road improvements the risk of catastrophic failures of stream crossings and road fill is also much greater.Without an adequate water budget managers of water in the watershed will be unable to evaluate less likely to identify and less likely or able to implement improvements to water supply. ","Project Benefits: Water Budget Project: A detailed water budget allows managers and stakeholders to quantify and identify the sources and uses of water throughout the watershed. It will provide objective numerical data to guide selection of project priorities identify potential problem areas and forecast response to various proposed projects. A well-maintained water budget will also allow water supply agencies to better coordinate responses to demand needs and will support the development of improved monitoring and adaptive management tools. Additionally detailed hydrologic measurements or modeling of subwatersheds will improve our understanding of annual flows storm response and baseflow conditions especially if this model can be calibrated to existing flow information. A model will allow analysis of various different test scenarios to help identify the potential benefits and impacts associated with various strategies. Understanding the interaction between stream conditions and subsurface withdrawals will help establish sustainable limits to groundwater use improved management strategies for groundwater pumping given instream flow effects and can help improve groundwater storage and conjunctive use strategies. Improved estimates of actual (versus permitted) water rights diversions will help to estimate the losses (reductions) associated with diversions as opposed to all other loss mechanisms. In addition to evaluating permitted water rights an estimate of private well usage in the watershed on a monthly and annual basis would augment the water balance and help to determine the cumulative level of impact from private well usage. A detailed accounting of water diversions from Pilarcitos Reservoir to other facilities operated by SFPUC (e.g. Crystal Springs Reservoir) is in progress. This fundamental data will help identify strategies for more efficient water transfers and maintenance of instream flows for Pilarcitos Creek. Previous monitoring studies for several of the subwatersheds collected streamflow data at 15-minute intervals. However the published reports only provide summary results that limit our ability to evaluate more detailed subwatershed response patterns. Compiling and integrating this data into a watershed-scale hydrologic analysis could help inform the rainfall-runoff transformation and baseflow conditions for these tributaries which could help establish operational strategies for managing flow releases below Pilarcitos Lake and Stone Dam. Road Project:Pacific Watershed Associates Inc. (PWA) has prepared the implementation plan (Plan 1) for road related sediment reduction in the Pilarcitos Creek watershed [4.] Plan 1 is based on sediment source assessment data collected and analyzed by PWA between 2008 and 2011 [4 5]. The 2009 report summarized the field assessment of approximately 9.8 mi of roads and 42 sediment delivery sites in the Apanolio Creek and Mills Creek subwatersheds of Pilarcitos Creek. The 2011 report evaluated an additional ~ 2.6 mi of roads and 9 sediment delivery sites in the upper watershed area of Pilarcitos Creek. This sediment reduction plan recommends treatment of selected sediment delivery sites from the 2009 assessment and all sites from the 2011 upper Pilarcitos Creek road assessment. Plan 1 provides the treatment prescriptions (including road logs maps and typical drawings) required to implement erosion control and erosion prevention treatments along 5 road reaches in the Pilarcitos Creek watershed that were identified as top priority for treatment by PWA the SMCRCD and high interest level of landowners. The roads reviewed for this sediment reduction plan total approximately 5.4 mi and include 36 sediment delivery sites and approximately 3.45 mi of hydrologically connected road segments. Estimated reduction in future sediment delivery if all components of the plan are implemented to specifications totals 4058 cubic yards. The expected benefit of completing the erosion control and erosion prevention treatments recommended in this report lies in the reduction of long-term sediment delivery to the Pilarcitos Creek watershed which contains important habitat for steelhead production in coastal California. Roads are typically one of the largest sources of fine sediment pollution. Erosion from cut-slopes and bare road surfaces is easily routed to the road drainage system which is often connected to the stream environment during large storms. Road drainage systems can destabilize roads fill-slopes causing landslides. Hydrologic effects from road can also have significant impacts to both peak flows and baseflows. Several anecdotal citations and consulting team observations of road problems were noted during the watershed assessment update process.

Historical information on wetland distribution can inform planning for wetland restoration and associated water quality improvement. The project will provide a framework for effective watershed-scale LID and related runoff reduction efforts. The project will identify opportunities for strategic floodplain restoration and groundwater recharge. Historical information will be used in prioritizing restoration efforts and maximizing the resilience of restored landscapes. Findings will aid in identifying locations conducive to natural flood protection strategies such as wetland restoration. The project will identify opportunities to increase green spaces and restore natural landscapes in disadvantaged communities particularly in low-lying floodprone settings at the Bay margin. Work in Marin and Sonoma counties will be carried out in collaboration with the federally-recognized Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria with whom we are collaborating on Historical Ecology studies within their aboriginal Bay Area territory. ","Detailed description: This project will synthesize results from both completed and planned studies of historical watershed conditions and functioning in the Bay Area to create integrated tools for sustainable watershed management in the region. The project team will evaluate previously-completed studies to identify data gaps (in terms of climate zones watershed sizes and land use trajectories) and select additional watersheds for intensive study based on regional data needs and local interest/application. Targeted local projects will likely include the Walnut Creek Historical Ecology Study (in collaboration with the Contra Costa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District) the Novato Creek Historical Ecology Study (in collaboration with the Marin County Flood Control and Water Conservation District) and others to be determined. The project will then synthesize comparative information across watersheds to identify appropriate local management and restoration strategies based on watershed characteristics and land use trajectories. The watershed management tools developed through the project will include conceptual models of watershed functioning basemaps showing historical watershed conditions and a suite of site-specific restoration and adaption strategies addressing natural flood protection ecosystem restoration and water supply management. These products will be compiled into a toolbox for public dissemination and use including well-illustrated accessible reports GIS/data files and a website. ","Project Need: In future decades conflicts between flood protection water supply water quality and ecosystem health are expected to intensify as population growth climate change non-native species invasions and other stressors place increasing demands on aquatic ecosystems around the Bay Area. Satisfying these competing demands   by sustaining and enhancing the full range of watershed functions   will require innovative management strategies that recognize how local watershed functions were distributed and expressed under more natural conditions (i.e. prior to significant Euro-American modification). Recent studies by the San Francisco Estuary Institute (SFEI) in collaboration with a number of local agencies have produced a wealth of practical historical ecology information to inform water management strategies for Bay Area watersheds including information on the heterogeneous distribution of intermittent and perennial stream reaches natural stream morphology types and high versus low groundwater areas. For example SFEI s historical ecology studies have helped in identifying locations for sustainable wetland restoration for flood attenuation and storage developing approaches for natural flood protection through the reestablishment of strategic floodplain features and setting appropriate streamflow targets. Historical ecology information has also been important for correcting misunderstandings about local ecosystems such as assumptions about perennial water conditions in our semi-arid region. Given that many of our streams and other habitats were adapted to relatively dry conditions historical ecology information can help in prioritizing the use of scarce water resources and improving the resilience of the Bay Area environment to likely drought conditions in the future. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Historical ecology tools provided by this regional synthesis will help to avert a range of negative impacts that may arise from short-sighted management and restoration approaches. Without information about the distribution of historical habitats and the natural expression of watershed functions important opportunities and constraints for restoration and resource management will not be identified and limited funding for restoration flood protection and other projects will be allocated less efficiently. Conflicts between flood protection water supply and ecosystem health will likely intensify and aquatic systems will remain less resilient to climate change and other stressors. Opportunities to restore strategic floodplain features and increase groundwater recharge will go unexploited. ","Project Benefits: Building upon existing projects this regional effort will fill data gaps in target watersheds and synthesize information across the region to develop a locally-specific framework of natural watershed functioning. Products from the project will include conceptual models maps and other tools to enable local agencies to adopt more effective and sustainable watershed management strategies leading to benefits in water supply water quality flood management and ecosystem health. Equally important the historical ecology approach helps develop a shared perspective about watershed history and potential future scenarios increasing public support for well-designed management actions. The project will create a regional basemap showing the distribution of historically perennial and intermittent stream reaches as well as conceptual models and hydrographs showing stream flow peaks summer flow groundwater recharge and groundwater levels over time. These tools will help in identifying strategic adjustments in water transport floodplain protection groundwater recharge and flow releases that can meet the water needs of local communities while sustaining ecosystem functions. Using this information stream augmentation flows can be prioritized to areas with appropriate hydrogeomorphology and hydrographs can be adjusted to maximize the efficient use of local water supplies and decrease reliance on Bay/Delta water sources. Similarly documenting the natural distribution of perennial versus seasonal wetlands throughout the region will identify the few critical places where topography soils and groundwater relationships will be likely to sustain wetlands in the future. Wetlands provide important habitat mitigate flood damage and also play a key role in regulating water quality through N/P reduction and other functions. Information about historical wetland characteristics and locations will inform efforts to design and restore healthy wetlands to achieve ecosystem water quality and flood management objectives. As communities increasingly desire integrative approaches to flood protection that also provide aesthetic and ecosystem functions a historical understanding of local stream morphology and history will support the next generation of natural flood protection design. For example re-integrating native tree cover and naturally distributed surface water storage/recharge functions based on historical analogues will maximize the local retention of water resources and reduction of downstream flood peaks. Lastly understanding the ecosystem characteristics of the more drought-tolerant riparian corridor types -- which are not well represented today but were more common under past climates -- will help design less water-dependent more climate change resilient systems.

Montalvin Manor is subject to subject to localized flooding (an impediment to correcting bighted conditions) due to constraints to the downstream storm drain system. Significant constraints to the efficient conveyance of stormwater include a low capacity in drainages that pass under railroad tracks between the project and its discharge point and tidal influences. The Montalvin Manor Stormwater Harvest and Use Bioretention and Flood Risk Reduction Project will capture stormwater runoff from the subdivision above this constrained area and pump it to a cistern located within Montalvin Park (an approximately 8.5 acre park adjacent to the residential area of Montalvin Manor). Stormwater runoff captured in this cistern will then be used to irrigate landscaping within the park. If the capacity of the cistern is exceeded overflow will be treated by a bioretention facility. If infiltration is determined to be feasible overflow from the cistern may instead be managed via infiltration. In addition to dischargeing cleaner stormwater runoff at reduced volumes this project is intended to help alleviate flooding problems within Montalvin Manor. ","Project Need: Montalvin Manor experiences periodic flooding which has a history of causing property damage. A number of constraints confound abilities to improve the area's drainage via simple storm drain system improvements. In addition stormwater runoff from this area can be reasonably assumed to contain pollutant loads characteristic of similarly urbanized developed areas. The Montalvin Manor Stormwater Harvest and Use Bioretention and Flood Risk Reduction Project will reduce the volume of stormwater runoff from the subdivision by harvesting stormwater for irrigation of Montalvin Park; this will also reduce the park's dependency on potable water for irrigation purposes. Excess stormwater runoff will be treated by a bioretention facility to remove pollutants thereby also increasing the quality of stormwater runoff from the area. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Periodic flooding within Montalvin Manor can be anticipated to continue to occur at a similar frequency and intensity. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) The Montalvin Manor Stormwater Harvest and Use Bioretention and Flood Risk Reduction Project will reduce the dependency of the 8.5 acre Montalvin Park on potable water supplies for irrigation purposes. Stormwater runoff harvested from the flood prone low-lying areas of Montalvin Manor will be pumped to a cistern located within the park. The harvested runoff will then be used to irrigate landscaping in the park. ii. Water Quality The Montalvin Manor Stormwater Harvest and Use Bioretention and Flood Risk Reduction Project will improve the water quality of stormwater runoff from Montalvin Manor. Runoff that has been harvested will primarily be used to irrigate landscaping in the park which will reduce the quantity of runoff from the subdivision (and will remove the pollutants that would have been borne by the eliminated runoff). Overflow from the cistern will be routed to a bioretention facility that will remove pollutants from that runoff before it is discharged. If feasible infiltration may also be used to manage runoff that has overflowed from the cistern and routed to the bioretention facility. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management The Montalvin Manor Stormwater Harvest and Use Bioretention and Flood Risk Reduction Project is intended to reduce flood risk in the low-lying areas of Montalvin Manor. By capturing runoff before it accumulates and pumping it to a cistern where the runoff can be used as a resource (for landscape irrigation) the flood risk will be diminished. The bioretetnion facility which will receive overflow from the cistern will reduce the tare at which runoff is discharged and increase its time of concentration. If infiltration proves feasible for dischrages from the bioretention facility this will serve to further reduce the risk of flooding.

The project will also restore approximately 2 acres of shaded aquatic riverine habitat to the York creek corridor as well as remediate water quality excessive sediment yield spawning requirements and fish passage by restoring more natural biological and fluvial processes. ","Detailed description: The proposed action is the Upper York Creek Ecosystem Restoration Project at the Upper York Creek Dam and Reservoir (UYCD) also referred to as the Upper St. Helena Dam. The project sponsors the City of St. Helena (City) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers San Francisco District South Pacific Division (Corps) propose to remove or modify the dam and appurtenances remove accumulated sediment and restore the local ecology of York Creek. The project will restore steelhead passage to 2.5 miles of spawning and rearing habitat with the removal of Upper York Creek Dam barrier resulting in reducing diversion entrainment losses of juvenile fish. It will improve fish passage and habitat connectivity reduce future downstream habitat degradation and fish kill. It will restore former reservoir area to a natural creek channel native riparian corridor and include a new pedestrian pathway with interpretive signage. UpperYork Creek Dam removal and restoration will reconstruct the underlying streambed to its natural gradient resulting in habitat beneficial coarse sediment transport and fish passage conditions similar to those existing throughout adjacent reaches of York Creek. In addition to habitat restoration a new constructed pathway will provide a passive public recreational activity complete with interpretive signage. The York Creek Dam currently is a significant obstacle to passage for federally listed steelhead in the threatened Central California Coast (CCC) Evolutionary Significant Unit. The current site condition of the dam consists of a 2.3 square mile area that drains to the creek above the dam. The dam is 140 ft long rises 50 ft above the streambead with a crest elevation of 620 ft and was originally made up of 12670 cubic yards of fill material. A concrete side channel spillway is located on the eastern side of the dam and runs adjacent and parallel to Spring Mtn Rd. The benefits of the completion of this project will remediate water quantity rearing requirements and fish passage limiting factors by restoring access to 2.5 miles of spawning and rearing habitat and reducing diversion entrainment losses of juvenile fish. The project will also restore approximately 2 acres of shaded aquatic riverine habitat to the York creek corridor as well as remediate water quality excessive sediment yield spawning requirements and fish passage by restoring more natural biological and fluvial processes. ","Project Need: Upper St. Helena Dam is located approximately 1.5 miles upstream of the City of St. Helena on Spring Mountain Road. Constructed in 1900 to expand water capacity for the rapidly growing City of St. Helena and the local wine industry UYCD was designed with a storage capacity of 10 million gallons. The earthen dam was originally 35 feet high and 140 feet long and was composed of more than 12000 cubic yards of channel-bed material that when excavated formed the upper reservoir. The dam was modified in the 1930s with the installation of a concrete spillway along Spring Mountain Road and a drop-inlet extension to the out-flow culvert. The dam height was raised 15 feet and the sluice gates were removed. With these alterations the dam can no longer be operated as a managed water-storage facility nor is it large enough to provide downstream flood control. The reservoir traps the annual supply of gravel and fine sediments produced by the watershed above UYCD. Sediment accumulates in the reservoir at a rate of 1000 to 5000 cubic yards per year depending on the magnitude of winter storm events. With total sediment storage potential of 28000 cubic yards of material the reservoir pool area is filled every 15-20 years. Over 100 years of sediment trapping has altered the geomorphology of York Creek downstream of UYCD and is thought to be a significant contributing factor to the six to eight feet of bed incision that has occurred in the Napa River over the last century. Regular maintenance of the dam is required including annual debris removal from the drop-inlet and spillway to maintain storm water passage and periodic removal of accumulated sediment. Four documented incidents of accidental catastrophic releases of fine sediment have occurred during maintenance activities at UYCD. These low-flow sediment discharges have resulted in mortality of fish and other aquatic organisms over the entire stretch of York Creek below the dam. York Creek contains the highest quality steelhead spawning and rearing habitat in the central Napa River Basin and maintenance of this habitat is very important to support overall Napa River steelhead populations. The recurring fish kills together with the dam being a total barrier to aquatic migration initiated formal enforcement actions from the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) and NOAA Fisheries Service requiring removal of UYCD. UYCD significantly impacts critical biological resources in the York Creek and Napa River watersheds. The objectives for removing or modifying UYCD are to restore fish passage for steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) reduce potential for future downstream low-flow fine sediment releases and their associated fish kills and allow for the restoration of approximately 3 acres of degraded riparian and aquatic habitat surrounding the dam and reservoir. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: No project results in incidents of accidental catastrophic releases of fine sediment occurring during maintenance activities at UYCD. These low-flow sediment discharges can result in mortality of fish and other aquatic organisms over the entire stretch of York Creek below the dam. York Creek contains the highest quality steelhead spawning and rearing habitat in the central Napa River Basin and maintenance of this habitat is very important to support overall Napa River steelhead populations.

Upper York Creek Dam would continue to act as an unnatural migration barrier to fish and other aquatic species No Project   The historic Upper St. Helena Dam would not be altered from its current configuration. No ecosystem restoration measures would be implemented. Regular maintenance dredging of the reservoir would be required to offset the continued deposition of materials behind the dam to prevent sediment releases. The Upper St. Helena Dam would continue to act as an unnatural migration barrier to fish and other aquatic species and the Upper York Creek Dam and Reservoir would continue to disrupt the natural transport of materials and organisms reducing their availability for downstream habitat and food and adversely affecting aquatic species and habitat. No mitigation can be provided. Potentially significant and unavoidable cumulative impact to global climate change.

Phase 2 of the project include pipelines storage and pumping facilities to serve customers west of Highway 101. The 2011 Water Recycling Feasibility Study Update recommends adding pipeline storage and pumping facilities based on an updated recycled water market assessment and anticipated growth patterns as outlined in the City s 2010 General Plan. Construction of Phase 1 is complete and includes disinfected tertiary treatment storage and distribution pumping facilities located at South Bayside System Authority and pipelines and customers east of Highway 101 in Redwood Shores the Greater Bayfront Area and the Seaport area. MARKET: The buildout estimated demand of City customers in the Phase 2 area is 507 afy; adding customers outside of the City limits would increase the demand by 273 afy to a total of 780 afy.

","Project Need: This project is needed to supply the existing and future potable water demands of Redwood City by taking non-potable uses off the limited potable water supply system. Redwood City has an Individual Water Supply Contract with the SFPUC under which Redwood City s Individual Supply Guarantee (ISG) is 10.93 MGD on an annual average basis (12243 afy). As Redwood City continues to develop and the demand for water increase the allocation remains unchanged. To supply the demands of current and coming years Redwood City needs to conserve water and maximize the use of recycled water for non-potable uses thereby freeing this demand from the SFPUC limit. Assuming the continued expansion and utilization of the City s Recycled Water Program and the implementation of water demand management measures the water demand projections for Redwood City stay below the SFPUC supply amount until at least 2030. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the project is not implemented there is the possibility that Redwood City would exceed its allocation of the San Francisco PUC water. Also during droughts or water shortages rationing would become more severe. Redwood City has an Individual Water Supply Contract with the SFPUC under which Redwood City s Individual Supply Guarantee (ISG) is 10.93 MGD on an annual average basis (or approximately 12243 acre feet per year.) Over the last 12 years Redwood City has exceed the ISG eight times. The 2010 General Plan the City has adopted the goal of eliminating surplus water purchases through a combination of augmentation of supply and reduction of demand through water conservation measures and expanded use of recycled water. Assuming the continued expansion and utilization of the City s Recycled Water Program and the implementation of water demand management measures the water demand projections for Redwood City stay below the SFPUC supply amount until at least 2030. If a 20 percent system wide shortage occurred however Redwood City could face severe cutbacks of as much as 27 percent in the year 2030. If water recycling was not implemented this cut back would be larger. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) The Project provides a non-potable supply for existing and future uses in the central area of Redwood City. This area is estimated to have 22 existing City water customers and 60% of future development/redevelopment areas that could be added to the recycled water system. The total estimated demand of City customers in the Phase 2 area is 507 AFY; adding customers outside of the City limits would increase the demand to 780 AFY. ii. Water Quality Water recycling reduces the amount of wastewater discharge to the San Francisco Bay and reduces the constituents that are in the effluent. 507 AFY of recycled water is equivalent of not discharging 165 million gallons/year of effluent to the San Francisco Bay. iii.

","Detailed description: The Bay-Friendly Coalition is proposing that the Bay-Friendly Rated Landscapes program be identified in the Bay Area IRWMP as a voluntary third-party verified standard that public and private property owners can use to guide the design construction and maintenance of their green infrastructure projects in order to maximize benefits to the watershed. The Coalition proposes to collaborate with government agencies nongovernmental organizations and property developers who are submitting green infrastructure/LID projects to the Bay Area IRWMP. Green infrastructure/LID is a proven approach to conserving stormwater onsite increasing groundwater recharge minimizing urban runoff to local waterways and reducing flooding risks and damage. While not yet the norm in our region green infrastructure is becoming an increasingly common practice when public and private landscapes are built or renovated. However not all approaches to green infrastructure maximize a site s potential benefits to water supply and quality watershed health and function and environmental resource protection. The Bay-Friendly Rated Landscapes system can help ensure that LID projects meet a comprehensive technically rigorous standard for watershed protection. This project will provide Bay Area city and county agencies and private sector developers with resources and standards to create institutional changes in how low impact developments are designed built and maintained in the Bay Area. PROJECT ACTIVITIES: Through this project partners who set a goal of earning the Bay-Friendly Rated Landscape designation could become eligible for grant funding through the Prop. 84 process to offset the cost of:   incorporating sustainable landscaping practices in their projects that have significant watershed benefits but that may have higher upfront costs than conventional landscaping practices   obtaining the Bay-Friendly Rated Landscape rating and recognition for the property   sending public agency staff to a comprehensive Bay-Friendly Qualified Landscape Professional training course for the design implementation and maintenance of green infrastructure/LID projects   hosting a Bay-Friendly Qualified Landscape Professionals training course in their jurisdiction In addition through this project the Bay-Friendly Coalition could also:   Assist municipalities with land-use authority to adopt policies or ordinances that tie the Bay-Friendly Rated Landscape standard to the development of new landscape and LID projects in their communities.   Conduct regional outreach efforts and disseminate project case studies and outcomes so that successes can be replicated statewide. This project directly supports the following IRMWP goals: 1. Promote environmental economic and social sustainability 2. Improve water supply reliability and quality 3. Protect and improve watershed health and function and Bay water quality 4. Improve Regional Flood Management 5. Create protect enhance and maintain environmental resources and habitats The Bay-Friendly Rated Landscapes rating system provides a clear and quantifiable path to healthier landscapes. It promotes a watershed approach to landscape design construction and maintenance. The Bay-Friendly Landscaping Guidelines consist of 55 integrated Best Management Practices (BMPs) that improve water and air quality conserve water create wildlife habitat and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Bay-Friendly Landscaping s rigorous standards are designated as BMPs in the Regional Water Quality Control Board s 2009 Municipal Regional Stormwater NPDES Permit. Specific to water quality Bay-Friendly BMPs: -- Increase on-site infiltration and reducing runoff-- Reduce contaminants in runoff-- Increase soil s ability to remove pollutants from runoff-- Create a healthier landscape adapted to the site -- Encourage planning during the design phase for ongoing maintenance that relies on integrated or organic pest management to minimize the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides PROJECT COST INFORMATION For green infrastructure/LID projects that participate in the Bay-Friendly Rating process the cost of implementing Bay-Friendly practices is incremental to the project s overall design and construction costs. These incremental costs vary depending on the sustainable landscaping practices that the project team chooses to implement but are typically 1 to 2% of project construction costs or less. The Bay-Friendly Rated Landscape registration fee is $550 per project. In addition the project owner or landscape designer contracts with a third-party Bay-Friendly Qualified Rater as part of the independent verification of the project s compliance with the rating system. The Coalition anticipates applying for a Prop. 84 grant to offset the cost of each participating project s incremental design and construction costs project registration and Rater fees as well as to fund the other activities listed above. ","Project Need: Green infrastructure principles emphasize simple low tech methods of managing storm water close to the source and preserving and recreating natural landscape features. Bay-Friendly practices support and strengthen green infrastructure principles with a holistic landscape approach that integrates water efficiency multifunctionality water quality protection and stormwater management. The Bay-Friendly Rated Landscapes rating system provides developers and funders of green infrastructure projects with a holistic proven environmental framework and independent third-party verification to help ensure that a site is designed and built to provide maximum water quality and watershed benefits. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: There is currently no consistent regional standard for guiding the development of or measuring the effectiveness of green infrastructure/LID projects at providing comprehensive watershed improvements. Without a standard it is difficult to know if projects are being designed built and maintained to maximize their benefits to water quality and environmental sustainability. If this project is not implemented: -- Property developers will be less likely to maximize watershed by implementing a holistic set of environmentally sound landscape practices including LID and water conservation. -- There would be no common understanding of sustainable landscaping practices (including those that affect water supply water quality and other water management issues) among the diverse group of stakeholders who design build and manage our built environment. These stakeholders include design and construction professionals property developers and managers in the public and private sectors and staff and decision makers in public works parks and recreation capital improvement and other positions in public agencies. -- Funders such as the California Department of Water Resources would not have an independent proven system for evaluating the environmental and water management benefits of a landscape project. -- Bay-Friendly Rated Landscapes is a well-established standard that is regularly updated to incorporate the most technically sound proven approaches to sustainable landscaping. Without a voluntary standard that continues to raise the bar for property developers and owners it will be more difficult to encourage effective innovative environmentally sound landscape practices without enacting new regulations. ","Project Benefits: The Bay-Friendly approach is based on seven principles : 1) Landscape Locally 2) Landscape for Less to the Landfill 3) Nurture the Soil 4) Conserve Water 5) Conserve Energy 6) Protect Water Quality and 7) Create Wildlife Habitat. Principles 1 3 and 6 all directly benefit LID projects while the remaining four increase the overall environmental benefits of the project. One of the fundamental efforts of Bay-Friendly Rated Landscapes is to encourage all LID projects to be Bay-Friendly Rated to ensure the maximum watershed and environmental benefits. i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) Bay-Friendly Rated Landscapes reduce irrigation water use by 50% or more compared to conventional landscaping practices. It does this through a holistic approach addressing the total landscape from creating drought resistant soils with compost and mulch installing low water using plants avoiding overplanting and designing and installing efficient irrigation systems. The Bay-Friendly approach not only saves water but creates built landscapes that will be more resilient in a changing climate and that provide habitat benefits. ii. Water Quality The Bay-Friendly Rated Landscapes rating system promotes a watershed approach to landscape design construction and maintenance. The Bay-Friendly Landscaping Guidelines consist of 55 integrated Best Management Practices (BMPs) that improve water and air quality conserve water create wildlife habitat and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Bay-Friendly Landscaping s rigorous standards are designated as BMPs in the Regional Water Quality Control Board s 2009 Municipal Regional Stormwater NPDES Permit. Specific to water quality Bay-Friendly BMPs: Increase on-site infiltration and reducing runoffReduce contaminants in runoff Increase soil s ability to remove pollutants from runoffCreate a healthier landscape adapted to the siteEncourage planning during the design phase for ongoing maintenance that relies on integrated or organic pest management to minimize the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides iii. Flood and Stormwater Management On average landscapes designed and built to meet or exceed Bay-Friendly Rated Landscapes standards achieve a 70% to 80% reduction in stormwater runoff. Bay-Friendly practices also provide flood protection by reducing runoff and increasing infiltration of stormwater by encouraging strategies such as increased organic matter content in soil permeable paving bioswales rain gardens and other LID features. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) Partners that collaborate with this project will produce multiple integrated watershed benefits. Bay-Friendly's holistic approach creates built landscapes that are more resilient in a changing climate and that provide multiple habitat benefits. Typical Bay-Friendly landscapes are designed to include a diverse palette of native plant species to provide wildlife habitat and avoid introducing invasive horticultural species. The Bay-Friendly approach also encourages planning during a project's design phase for ongoing maintenance that relies on organic or integrated pest management (IPM) to minimize the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides.

","Detailed description: The Bay Point Regional Shoreline Wetland Restoration project is located on Suisun Bay in the unincorporated community of Bay Point in eastern Contra Costa County. The project will preserve and restore 48 acre piece of Suisun Bay marshland and to provide public access to the bay shoreline. It will restore 16 acres of filled areas to tidal marsh The Bay Point Regional Shoreline consists of 138 acres of marsh and upland at the Bay Point waterfront. Restoration work would involve major earthmoving removal of levees and lowering the elevation of previously filled marshland. Cut and fill will be balanced on site if possible with fill material being deposited on upland areas. The project design will create self-sustaining channels that will minimize or eliminate the need for future dredging. Balance the preservation of the existing vegetation communities on site (e.g. seasonal ponds) with the improvement of marsh habitat. Implement cattail maintenance and invasive weed abatement activities. Provide control measures to eliminate the establishment of red fox and feral cat populations. Proposed resource management actions include monitoring existing special-status populations and maintaining viable habitat for these species appropriately managing invasive species using standard District vegetation management techniques and restoring 16 acres of filled areas to tidal marsh. A trail on the south west and east perimeter of the project area will provide access to the marsh and wildlife viewing opportunities in the least biologically-sensitive upland area of the Natural Unit. These viewing opportunities will be enhanced by the construction of an observation facility with interpretive panels benches and a short loop trail and boardwalk extending to a small marsh channel. Public safety will be maintained by fencing the southern boundary of the site thereby reducing vandalism in the area. This fence will also help prevent free-roaming pets from accessing the site and disturbing wildlife. Actions proposed for marsh restoration include draining seasonal non-tidal ponds; dredging excavating and grading; and creating new channels to allow tidal waters to enter the existing ponds. Approximately 100000 cubic yards of dredged fill will be deposited throughout the upland areas. No off-site disposal of fill is anticipated. Sixteen acres of new tidal marsh would be created which would more than double the tidal marsh area on the project site (from 11 to 27 acres). Restoration will include creating a channel (approximately 100 feet wide) into the site and enlarging existing indentations on the western side of the J-shaped channel to create fish habitat. ","Project Need: Regionally the extent of marshlands was much greater prior to urban and industrial development along the Carquinez Strait-Suisun Bay-San Joaquin River corridor. Prior to the mid-1800s it appears that a continuous band of tidal marsh and sloughs were present along the northern Contra Costa County shoreline as far west as Martinez and east past Pittsburg. These marshes were influenced by saltwater flows from the San Francisco/San Pablo Bay system and by freshwater flows from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. Therefore the marshes further west have historically been saltwater marshes due to the bay influence and the marshes closer to the river delta have been freshwater marshes. Bay Point is located at the approximate meeting point of the saltwater and freshwater flows and therefore a \"brackish\" (combination salt and freshwater) marsh has developed here over time. This area exhibits very high biological productivity. As of the year 2012 only pieces of this original marshland remain along the northern Contra Costa County shoreline. Little of this original marshland is publicly accessible or accessible without special permission because it is either privately owned preserved as wildlife habitat or is part of the Concord Naval Weapons Station. Bay Point Regional Shoreline therefore would be one of the few places where people would have ready access to the marsh its channels and the Suisun Bay Shoreline. This is a very important connection for residents whose communities have historically been linked economically and culturally to the shoreline but now they themselves cannot gain ready access to it. The proposed project site is located on a flat plain of marshlands surrounded by residential military and industrial development. Within this urbanized region Bay Point Regional Shoreline is unique in that it provides undeveloped open space and valuable marsh habitat. The site provides the public with views of Suisun Bay and opportunities for marsh restoration trail use birdwatching access to shoreline fishing and other passive activities. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The proposed project site is located on a flat plain of marshlands surrounded by residential military and industrial development. Within this urbanized region Bay Point Regional Shoreline is unique in that it provides undeveloped open space and valuable marsh habitat. The site provides the public with views of Suisun Bay and opportunities for marsh restoration trail use bird watching access to shoreline fishing and other passive activities. These opportunities will be greatly limited if the project is not completed. The existing J channel was dug to provide more tidal action to the property. This was a court-ordered mitigation project as a result of various aspects of an on-site sand-dredging operation. Several smaller inter-connected channels and dead-end sloughs also travel from Suisun Bay into the marsh. These have a water surface area that covers approximately 70000 square feet of the marsh. These smaller channels range from approximately 5-20 feet wide and typically less than 4 feet deep. Sand was dredged from the bay by a hydraulic dredge on a barge and the slurry was transferred to the site through a pipe that crossed the marsh from Suisun Bay. The slurry of bay water and sand was discharged into a settling pond then was eventually separated into a series of other ponds that emptied from one to another by means of weirs and the water was routed back to the bay. The sand and silt that was deposited in the ponds was dried and some of the sand was moved to the south edge of the property adjacent to the railroad tracks. This area was used for equipment storage. The remainder of the deposited sand was dried scraped together removed by trucks and sold. This operation continued until the mid-1970s or 1980s. Several modifications of the dikes on-site channels and other earth moving activities in the ponds also occurred during this period. The large There is ongoing planning in the region to conserve wildlife habitat. Bay Point Regional Shoreline is located within the region of the Sacramento/San Joaquin River Delta that has been designated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as critical habitat for delta smelt winter-run chinook salmon and steelhead. In addition the Suisun Bay area -- which includes Bay Point -- is the focus of new efforts by the State Water Resources Control Board and other regulatory agencies to improve fisheries. This includes managing freshwater outflows from the rivers to modify the salinity of Sui sun Bay and improve fish habitat. With these regional planning considerations in mind Bay Point is in a unique location to improve fish habitat. A marsh restoration project at Bay Point will therefore fit in well with these regional plans to improve local fisheries ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality The improved channel network will provide better circulation and exchange between Suisun Bay and the existing tidal marsh areas. The project will improve water quality for fishery habitat. Improve site drainage and water quality: direct surface runoff generated on the site through a system of bioswales or vegetated channels integrated with the existing seasonal wetlands. Expansion of the tidal wetland is an opportunity to increase storm water storage and passive treatment capacity. Stabilize eroding shoreline: stabilization of eroding shorelines is an opportunity to limit sedimentation and degradation of sensitive habitats. Improve stormwater drainage and trail surface: regrade the trail on the southern boundary to improve drainage and sediment control direct surface runoff generated on the trail system to bioswales or vegetated channels for improved percolation and on-site treatment. Benefits would include improved hydrology for the existing tidal marsh and creation of additional tidal marsh. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Flood and stormwater management is about at the seaward edge of the trail or the top of the armor. The roughness of the existing armor and rubble limits the height that the runup could potentially reach but the trail is impacted and likely contributes to winnowing and erosion along the trail. Along the Beach significant flooding is expected. Although the runup is lower at the Beach because the slope is flatter low areas and pathways through the dunes could cause significant flooding in and behind the dunes. Along the south shoreline the ground elevation is significantly lower than the runup elevation and waves are expected to reach approximately 50 feet inland. The estimates for total water level (TWL) will to guide planning evaluation and design of restoration and public access improvements for Albany Beach. Appropriate consideration of the future TWL conditions and influence on the site will also provide a framework for adaptive management and maintenance of the site. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) Six special-status plant species could occur at the Bay Point Regional Shoreline. All six are associated with tidal marshes or the banks of tidal channels and sloughs. One of these species is federally and state listed and one is state listed. The rest are California Native Plant Society (CNPS) listed species and/or federal species of concern. The Sacramento splittail and several other special-status fish species could benefit from creation and enhancement of tidal marsh on the project site The following special-status species are known to occur in the tidal marsh and tidal channels on the project site: four special-status plant species (Suisun Marsh aster Delta tule pea Delta lilaeopsis and soft bird's beak) and five special-status wildlife species (California black rail saltmarsh common yellowthroat Suisun song sparrow tricolored blackbird and western pond turtle). A trail on the south west and east perimeter of the project area will provide access to the marsh and wildlife viewing opportunities in the least biologically-sensitive upland area of the Natural Unit. These viewing opportunities will be enhanced by the construction of an observation facility with interpretive panels benches and a short loop trail and boardwalk extending to a small marsh channel.

","('East Bay';) | Contra Costa County "," ","July 2013 ","July 2020 ","Contra Costa County ","Project Type Description: ","Detailed description: In the initial phase monitoring protocols for total mercury reactive mercury and methylmercury would be developed and tested on treated and untreated stormwater. Once the protocols have been developed and tested they would be pilot tested on a range of existing LID treatment devices or on new installations. It would be important to monitor a variety of designs to understand how design features may affect performance. To that end CCCWP would identify suitable LID treatment systems from throughout the County and would also seek partnerships with other MS4 dischargers including the California Department of Transportation who may be interested in monitoring LID for mercury and methylmercury. It is anticipated that each LID treatment system to be evaluated would be monitored during at least three different storm events. The exact number of systems to be evaluated and the timing and duration of the study would be determined through development of the detailed study plan. Project captial funds would be used to construct new LID tretament targetting areas where the most significant PCB concentrations in sediments that have been identified. These areas are known to exist in disadvantaged areas of Richmond whihc as a city lacks the resources to construct the stormwater treatment retrofits needed to attain the PCB load reductions needed. ","Project Need: Contra Costa County has established a policy making low-impact development (LID) the preferred method of treatment to meet requirements for stormwater treatment established under provision C.3 of both the SFBRWQCB and the CVRWQCB permit. Both permits also require a Best Management Practice (BMP) effectiveness evaluation under parallel provisions C.8.d.ii. Although LID-type treatment devices are known to be highly effective at removing sediment from urban stormwater to date very little information is available on the effectiveness of LID for reducing mercury and methylmercury.

The initial design requires some minor changes to ensure the habitat structure and function are optimized while providing flood protection to the community. This project will use consensus decision making of the diverse stakeholders to develop a restoration enhancement and management plan that will then be used to obtain programmatic regulatory permits to implement it. ","Project Need: The Wildcat-San Pablo Creek Corp Project is one of the first integrated flood protection projects in the Bay Area (in terms of diverse stakeholders project goals and project elements). Since it's construction in the late 1980's-early 1990's a number of elements have been modified and enhanced. At the same time several studies have shown additional opportunities to restore and enhance the project. At the same time the Corps authored Maintenance Plan reflects the original built conditions. This requested grant will allow the diverse stakeholder group The Wildcat-San Pablo Watershed Council to identify additional restoration and enhancement activities implement them and re-write the Maintenance Plan to incorporate all of the improvements made with the project. The Maintenance Plan will clearly delineate what activities shall be conducted the goals and objectives that are to be met what metrics will trigger their initiation what conditions trigger completion of the maintenance activity. In addition this grant project will allow staff at the FCD to pursue long term programmatic regulatory permits the five Resource Agencies who regulate the Corp Project (USACE USFWS NMFS SF Regional Board CDFG). Finally this project will allow the FCD to change the baseline condition within the US Army Corps of Engineers so that future maintenance will be compatiable with Army Corps standards. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The most significant possible impact will be the removal of approximately 1/2 of the riparian forest andjacent or on the south levee of both Wildcat and San Pablo Creeks. A likely impact will be continued poor salmonid migration through the project area. A PROBABLE impact will insufficent capacity of the Corps project to convey a 100-year level storm flood flows leading to flooding of the adjacent community (a DAC) . A POSSIBLE impact will be decertification of the Corps Project leading to loss of FEMA 100 year level protection for the community (causing all mortgaged properties to purchase flood insurance) and loss of federal funding in the event of a Federally declared disaster. ","Project Benefits: Water Quality The grant project will clearly define ways to improve the design enhancement and maintenance of the sediment basin at the upstream end of Wildcat Creek (just downstream of the two railroad crossings). Specifically it will design a baffle system within the sediment basin to force flows to slow down and meander allowing sediment to drop out (and not in downstream reaches where sediment removal is difficult to conduct. The project will enhance riparian forest communities to provide shade for salmonid migrations. Flood and Stormwater Management The grant project will identify locations where selected vegetation management and sediment removal needs to occur and implement these actions to ensure flood flows will remain within the streambanks. It will also create a vegetation management plan to optimize both habitat and flood protection. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The grant project will redesign the sediment basin to improve salmonid migration. The vegetation management plan will create a maintenance regime to optimize the health of the riparian forest and plan for continual regeneration.

Soil Erosion & Sediment Management. Implementation of best management practices to reduce soil erosion and prevent excess sediment deposition from grassland into seasonal wetland and marsh areas. ","Project Need: One of the most unique and ecologically important features of Rush Ranch is the intact gradual transition zone between tidal slough marsh and uplands. This feature provides the possibility for estuarine transgression whereby marsh and transitional habitat can migrate upslope in response to sea level rise a rarity within the Suisun Marsh and greater San Francisco Bay. The ecotone at Rush Ranch is also home to several rare and endangered species such as the CA clapper rail ( Rallus longirostris obsoletus ) black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) salt marsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys raviventris) and Suisun shrew (Sorex ornatus sinuosus) who use the area as escape cover from predators and high tides. The marsh - upland ecotone is connected across much of Rush Ranch but habitat quality within the ecotone has been impacted by weeds visitor use and other management issues. The 10-acre marsh to upland ecotone below the Rush Ranch Headquarters is crucial area to intercept and filter pollutants from road and corrals upslope. The current invasive annual-dominated vegetation community does not provide adequate filtration. In addition the current fenceline configuration is not conducive to managing weed populations and enhancing the habitat through careful grazing. Elsewhere on the ranch livestock distribution and stocking rate are limited by stockwater availability. An improved distribution of stockwater would enable site managers to use grazing as a management tool to improve habitat soil and hydrologic conditions in the uplands and protect wetland functions and values. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Impacts to highly sensitive rare tidal marsh and seasonal wetland habitats will occur on account of stormwater flow through the preserve headquarters. These are likely to intensify as climate change results in stronger storm events and as population growth increases demand on open space resources. Grassland soils and vegetation will continue to deteriorate and wetland areas may be impacted if the stock water infrastructure necessary for carefully managed grazing of non-native annual grasses is not constructed.

Minimize source and non-point source pollution as the study helps understand mercury methylation processes in support of the TMDL compliance and the SBSP NPDES permit. Controlling pollutants of concern specifically mercury from legacy mining deposits erosion and runoff from the upper watershed. Habitat Protection and Restoration: Protect restore and rehabilitate watershed processes as the study will assist managers in potentially completing the restoration of 1400 acres in Pond A8 to muted tidal or fully tidal wetlands by understanding mercury methylation and bioaccumulation in these systems. Protect restore and rehabilitate habitat for species protection; Enhance wildlife populations and species diversity; Protect and recover fisheries; as saltmarsh habitat supports a number of fish and wildlife species including special status species. Flood Protection: Manage floodplains to reduce flood damage since opening of the Pond A8 notch is designed to scour Alviso Slough thereby increasing flood conveyance for the Alviso community. Further opening of the Pond A8 notch is dependent upon mercury accumulation in biota as a result of the restoration actions. ","Detailed description: The South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project (SBSP) conducted a comprehensive mercury monitoring in Alviso Slough Pond A8 and nearby reference locations in 2010 and 2011 before and after major restoration projects in the Alviso area. Samples of water sediment fish and bird eggs were collected and analyzed for mercury along with evaluation of scour and sediment flux in system. Specifically fish samples were collected in Alviso Slough and Artesian Slough for mercury analysis approximately 5 or 6 times during the waterbird breeding season. To continue to evaluate the effect of restoration actions on the mobilization methylation and bioaccumulation of mercury the SBSP secured EPA grant funding to continue these studies in 2013 (limited scour and sediment flux work is being conducted in 2012). However the EPA grant funds were not sufficient to include analysis of water and sediment as part of the biosentinel studies. Coincident with the ongoing comprehensive mercury study being conducted by the SBSP Mark Marvin DiPasquale of the U.S. Geological Survey conducted an initial evaluation of sediment methylmercury (MeHg) in Artesian Slough which receives discharge from the City of San Jose wastewater treatment plant. The results found sediment MeHg concentrations higher in Artesian Slough than in Alviso Slough even though Alviso Slough had significantly higher total mercury in sediments as a result of releases from mercury mining deposits in the upper part of Guadalupe River/Alviso Slough watershed. This study would supplement the EPA study in 2013 by collecting water and sediment samples for mercury analysis in Alviso Slough Artesian Slough and Guadalupe Slough during the same times and locations as the slough fish will be collected and analyzed for mercury. In this way we will better understand the mechanisms and processes that control the methylation of mercury and understand the role of primary productivity in the mercury methylation process. We will also be able to evaluate the methylation and bioaccumulation of mercury in Alviso Slough in response to the restoration actions undertaken in late 2010 and mid 2011 and be able to inform management decisions regarding the continued opening of the Pond A8 notch on Alviso Slough. The SBSP Restoration Project seeks the full opening of the Pond A8 notch in order to allow full tidal inundation and create 1400 acres of high quality wetlands as well as scour Alviso Slough in order to provide increased flood conveyance and navigation to the adjacent community of Alviso. This understanding of mercury methylation process in Alviso Slough will also eventually support the management decision whether to restore Pond A8 to full tidal flows. The issue of nutrients/primary productivity/Hg methylation also directly relates to the SBSP restoration since we need to understand Artesian Slough Hg dynamics as there are ponds proposed for restoration off that slough as well. In fact we are working right now on making Pond A17 fully tidal and we are partnering with City of San Jose in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to do restoration of Pond A18 as well as the other ponds off Artesian Slough. In addition we have ponds off of Guadalupe Slough that we may open to tidal flows for marsh restoration in the future. The 2 primary goals of this study are to: 1. to support the 2013 work we are doing in Alviso Slough with the EPA grant that we were not able to fund in that grant (i.e. Hg in water collocated with biosentinels) to support further opening of the Pond A8 notch. 2. a better understanding of the role of primary productivity in methylation of Hg in sloughs that may influence future restoration of ponds located off Guadalupe and Artesian Sloughs. ","Project Need: The South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project (SBSP Restoration Project) is one of the country s largest wetland restoration projects and plans to eventually restore approximately 15000 acres of former salt evaporation ponds back to tidal wetlands in South San Francisco Bay. This opportunity is unfortunately located in a mercury-rich environment due to historic and continuing run off from the New Almaden Quicksilver Mine (the Guadalupe River watershed drains into the project area: Alviso Slough and adjacent ponds). One of the project s key scientific uncertainties is how tidal restoration could remobilize mercury laden sediments or create environmental conditions that increase mercury methylation and bioaccumulation. In order to continue to restore tidal wetlands the SBSP Restoration Project must monitor the changes in mercury s distribution availability and bioaccumulation that could be caused by project actions. Without this information the SBSP Restoration Project will not be able to design projects that avoid mercury mobilization and bioaccumulation or possibly not even be allowed to implement future phases because of lingering concerns about mercury. Two recent projects reconnecting salt ponds back to the Bay are of the most pressing concern. Pond A8 (and the hydrologically-connected Ponds A5 and A7) was opened to Bay in June 2011 through a water control structure and Pond A6 was fully connected to the tides through levee breaches in December 2010. It is imperative to the overall success of the SBSP Restoration Project to answer key questions about these projects:   What are the effects from the partial breach of Pond A8 and the full tidal breach of Pond A6?   As the tidal gates in Pond A8 are opened further what are the effects on mercury methylation and can we fully restore more ponds to tidal action like A6?   And eventually can the restoration planning effort underway with the US Army Corps of Engineers ( the Shoreline Study ) to restore Ponds A9-A15 and A18 to tidal wetlands proceed without negative impacts from mercury? In order to answer these questions the SBSP Restoration Project has started a comprehensive regional mercury monitoring effort that builds on past studies. We did receive an EPA grant to continue our mercury biosentinel monitoring (fish in sloughs and bird eggs from ponds) in 2013. As part of that proposal we added collection of fish for mercury analysis in Artesian Slough and Guadalupe Slough as reference areas with Alviso Slough being the focus of the study with respect to continued opening of the Pond A8 notch. We however were not able to fund the collection and analysis of mercury in water column and sediment of these areas. We are interested in seeking IRWMP grant to fund the collection and analysis of mercury in fish water column and sediment of Alviso Slough with Artesian Slough and Guadalupe Slough as reference locations over a 3 year period. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Without additional funding the SBSP Restoration Project will be faced with the undesirable choice of either continuing with tidal restoration actions without fully understanding their effects on mercury or forgoing the tremendous benefits of tidal wetland restoration because of the fears of possible environmental harm. Since the SBSP Restoration Project covers so many acres in the Bay slowing down or forgoing restoration will hinder several regional planning efforts such as the Bay Ecosystem Goals Report the San Francisco Estuary Partnership s Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) and the San Francisco Bay Joint Venture from achieving their tidal wetland restoration goals. In addition with declining sediment levels in the Bay Shoreline Study modeling indicates that if opening ponds to tidal waters is significantly delayed in the Alviso area the ponds may never evolve into vegetated marsh since sea-level rise may out pace sediment supply. This highlights the urgency to resolve scientific uncertainties such as mercury so that pond restoration can be implemented as fast as possible. ","Project Benefits: i.

"139 ","Corte Madera Creek Headwaters Restoration Plan ","The Corte Madera Creek watershed has been the subject of numerous studies and restoration efforts in the last several decades. While these plans often cite the value of this application's project area there have been no recent actions to protect steelhead or their habitat in this area nor to gather data on fish populations to better inform the efforts. This project will function to gather new data on steelhead in San Anselmo Carey Camp and Cascade Creeks coalesce and incorporate data and recommendations from new and old plans and reports and come up with a series of actions that can be designed and implemented in the next five years with the end result of protecting and enhancing steelhead populations and habitat in the Cascade Canyon Open Space Preserve. ","('North Bay';) | Marin ","37.97805600 : -122.61444400 - ","01/10/2013 ","09/01/2015 ","The project site is in Cascade Canyon Open Space Preserve behind the town of Fairfax in Marin County. It is at the end of Cascade Drive. The project area begins immediately to the left of the gate and follows the creek all the way to Cascade Falls. A foot path and fire road also lead to the falls. The project area includes Carey Camp Creek which is demarcated by a large rip-rap fish passage barrier several hundred yards upstream of the gate. See attached maps for delineation of the project area. ","Project Type Description: This project would address water quality improvement and stormwater improvements by eliminating fine-grain sediment contributions to the project area creeks by hydrologically disconnecting fire roads and other erosion problem sites. The other main focus of this project is protection of the remaining steelhead populations in Cascade Carey Camp and San Anselmo creeks. This project would help in this manner by assessing current populations and providing a blueprint for future restoration actions. ","Detailed description: The Cascade Canyon Open Space Preserve contains as referenced in recent reports and management plansthe \"nursery\" for steelhead in the Corte Madera Creek watershed. Flood control efforts have impaired the lower reaches of the watershed and the northwest forks of Fairfax and Sleepy Hollow creeks do not offer the same quality of protected habitat as the District and adjacent MMWD lands that encompass San Anselmo Creek. While large-scale plans and efforts to restore fish passage from the San Francisco Bay to the headwaters continue it is the intent of this project to do its best to protect and enhance the steelhead spawning and rearing grounds that exist within its boundaries. To do so the project needs to accomplish three main goals: 1) Gather data on steelhead populations and better characterize the habitat. 2) Identify the threats to steelhead populations and their habitat. 3) Create a plan with alternatives for eliminating the threats and for providing the best possible steelhead habitat. Goal #1: Gather data on steelhead populations and better characterize the habitat.The discussions over whether to install bridges across San Anselmo Creek or to remove the fish passage barrier from Carey Camp Creek have been hindered by a lack of good data on current steelhead populations and habitat. Although historic data has shown robust populations in the creek there have been only three known surveys in the past twelve years: A 2012 DFG WSP survey which found redds young-of-the-year and juvenile steelhead in San Anselmo and Cascade Creek. A 2009 DFG electro-fish survey and habitat assessment for Carey Camp Creek found steelhead and made recommendations for habitat improvement including consideration of removal of the fish passage barrier. A 2000 complete survey and habitat survey by Alice Rich which made full recommendations for habitat preservation and restoration. To meet this goal of providing better data this project proposes to start consistent spawner surveys for the next three years starting in 2013. (Given that the steelhead spawning survey starts in January the District will fund this task as cost-share to avoid any conflicts with a grant agreement not being in place.) The spawner surveys will run from January to March each year with a fisheries survey crew walking the lengths of San Anselmo Carey Camp and Cascade Creeks as defined in the project area--a total length of about two miles. The surveys which will take place every two weeks for the three month duration will use methodology consistent with recent surveys and methods outlined in the CA Salmonid Stream Habitat Restoration Manual. The end goal is to provide data to the plan consultant DFG and plan partners on current steelhead populations and in turn support the development of actions from goal #3. Goal #2: Identify the threats to steelhead populations and their habitat. The project proposes to meet this goal by hiring a consulting planner and fisheries biologist to review recent data on steelhead populations water quality and flow as well as the incoming data from goal #1. In additionimpact of roads and trails and the increase in visitor use particularly mountain biking will be examined as a second task with a focus on understanding the impact of foot bike and vehicle traffic on the creekbed at the five locations the Cascade Fire Road crosses San Anselmo Creek. The consultant will have Tim Best's 2012 road and trail inventory for their use which has assessed area roads and trails and quantified the sediment delivery to creeks and has provided prescriptions for treatment. The third task in this goal will be to have the consultant assess the Carey Camp Creek fish barrier. This barrier which has existed for the last twenty years was recommended for removal by the 2009 DFG survey of the creek but questions remained about whether itshould be a partial or full removal whether the habitat in San Anselmo Creek could support migration into and out of Carey Camp Creek and what the benefit to the steelhead population in Carey Camp Creek would be by reopening the mouth of the creek. Goal #3: Create a plan with alternatives for eliminating the threats and for providing the best possible steelhead habitat. This goal is expected to utilize most of the project budget. It will synthesize the new data gathered with existing information from Tim Best's 2012 road and trail inventory into a reach-level plan that addresses actions for the project area encompassing San Anselmo Carey Camp and Cascade Creeks. This plan should address the three priority areas that have been identified in past plans: 1) Cascade Fire Road creek crossings. The consultant team along with Tim Best will be directed to consider creation of three alternatives for the Cascade Fire Road: a) Bridges capable of handling up to Type III fire engines across the creeks with recommended locations preliminary designs and costs. b) Multi-use bridges only with recommendations for either restricting or rerouting vehicle traffic. c) No bridges with an assessment of the impact on the fish species in the project area. 2) Roads and trails in the project area. The 2012 road and trail inventory conducted by Tim Best contains recommendations for individual trails but does not consider use or trail systems on a reach-level or project area level. The direction to the consultant and Tim Best will be to come up with recommendations for reducing the impact of roads and trails on the project area creeks. These recommendations may involve rerouting or decommissioning trails or simply treating them to reduce sediment contributions but they must include sketches needed for permitting costs and GIS data for submittal to the grantor. 3) Carey Camp Creek fish passage barrier. This task would entail a recommendation on whether the barrier should be removed or partially removed the scope of the project and detailed cost estimates and preliminary designs. The consultanting team would be asked to present this information along with any other recommendations for steelhead habitat enhancement in report in draft form to the District for review before submission of a final report. ","Project Need: The Corte Madera Creek tributaries of San Anselmo Creek Cascade Creek and Carey Camp Creek lie within the Cascade Canyon Open Space Preserve which is a 500-acre preserve abutted by Mount Tamalpais and the lands of the Marin Municipal Water District. The tribs contained in the project area have been cited as containing the best steelhead habitat in the Corte Madera Creek watershed. In 1969 a survey in Cascade Creek alone found an estimated 1300 steelhead. More recent reports have reinforced that while Corps actions have disconnected the headwaters from the Bay for fish passage the \"nursery areas\" contained within the project area remain the best habitat for steelhead. The Cascade Canyon Open Space Preserve region of the watershed which contains approximately two miles of steelhead-bearing streams was cited in the Alice Rich report for its high habitat value. Mountain Biking The Cascade Canyon Fire Road bisects the project area beginning from the gate at the end of Cascade Drive in Fairfax running through the preserve and crossing the creek five times as it does so then heading upslope into the Mt. Tamalpais watershed and the lands of the Marin Municipal Water District. This three-mile long road which has the primary purpose of providing fire and other emergency vehicle access is also known as the birthplace of mountain biking. In 1976 the first ever downhill race was staged on the Cascade Fire Road by future mountain biking moguls Charlie Kelly and Gary Fisher. The ride down the road was so rough that riders had to repack their bearings with grease afterwards earning the fire road the informal moniker \"Repack.\" The Repack Road has grown in popularity exponentially attracting more than 900 riders at a time on some organized rides. Connecting trails have grown in popularity as well; the Tamarancho bike park which adjoins Cascade Canyon OSP has added trails and capacity in the past decade becoming a regional destination for mountain bikers and it provides easy access to Distict trails. There is also a noted increase in \"poaching\" by mountain bikers of hiking trails inside the preserve which run parallel to Carey Camp Creek. Mountain bike use on trails not designed for multiuse travel can cause significant erosion some of which can transport into the creeks. Overall the tremendous growth in mountain biking in the area has caused some alarm among the local community and environmental groups. Their particular focus in the project area has been the five locations at which the Cascade/Repack fire road crosses San Anselmo Creek and the potential impact from vehicle and mountain bike traffic to the steelhead populations. Current and Past District Management In 2005 the District released a management plan for Cascade Canyon that recognized the value of the steelhead populations in the preserve the impacts of the roads and trails on the habitat and the need for actions to protect the special status species. The plan lacked specific fisheries data however and instead cited Friends of Corte Madera Creek reports. There have been few actions undertaken from this plan that are related to roads and trails or fisheries--most of the actions taken have been related to vegetation management. This plan is notable for a discussion of whether bridges should be built across the creek and a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that recommends the installation of bridges to avoid environmental impact to San Anselmo Creek. In 2009 a Department of Fish and Game survey found optimal steelhead habitat in the Carey Camp Creek tributary but also noted a significant fish passage barrier at the creek's mouth. This barrier was caused by a District action in the early 1990's that intended to \"stabilize\" the creek. The 1991 plan designed by Harold Appleton of Prunuske Chatham responded to concerns that the creek was not \"stable\" and the recurrent downcutting was threatening nearby trails and discharging too much sediment into the watershed. (This sediment discharge however was seen at the time as a cause of flooding in the lower reaches of the watershed by reducing capacity. The plan did not cite the sediment as being harmful to fish.) Between 1991 and 1993 District crews installed veined structures in Carey Camp Creek and rip-rap a the creek mouth with the aim of stabilizing the creek channel. That action was successful but the creation of the barrier has also caused Carey Camp Creek to backfill with sediment that cannot pass the barrier. An engineering geologist Tim Best has estimated that the floor of the creek channel has accumlated between 4 and 7 feet of sediment and gravel since the District's barrier was installed. In addition to the creek channel raising informal discussions with DFG biologists have led to conclusions that this project significantly reduced the amount of steelhead habitat in Carey Camp Creek abut that removal of the barrier could remediate that problem. In 2011 the District commissioned a road and trail inventory for 50 miles of roads and trails that lie on Open Space Preserves within the Corte Madera Creek watershed. One of the focal areas for this inventory was the Cascade Canyon Open Space preserve with particular attention given to roads and trail that drain into Corte Madera Creek tributaries. Preliminary results have found high sediment delivery from the Cascade (Repack)Fire Road as well as erosion problems in trails surrounding tributaries such as Carey Camp Creek. The contractor hired to conduct the inventory Tim Best has completed past inventories for MCOSD and his methodology is consistent with the protocols set forth in the 1994 Ranch and Unpaved Roads Handbook authored by Danny Hagans of Pacific Watershed Associates. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If treatments for unpaved roads in the watershed are not implemented potentially thousands of cubic yards of fine grain sediment will be delivered into the fish-bearing tributaries of the Corte Madera Creek watershed. In addition human impacts may eventually cause extirpation of steelhead trout in the region. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality ..The main impact to water quality is the turbidity that is caused by humans bicycle tires or vehicles using the five stream crossings of San Anselmo Creek. This project would not directly impact this as it is a planning grant but would provide clear alternatives and preliminary costs and designs which would allow the District to proceed from this plan to the design and implementation phase.. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management .The 2012 Corte Madera Creek road and trail inventory by Tim Best provides recommendation for project area roads and trails that are already contributing high volumes of fine sediment into San Anselmo Creek and its tributaries. The recommendations from this road and trail inventory could be combined with new recommendations that incorporate visitor use changes (trail reroutes away from streams decommisioning and trail density reductions). Implementation of these plan recommendations will lead to a reduction in chronic sediment delivery associated with road surface erosion causing frequent intervals of high turbidity and degrading spawning gravel quality. Implementation of the plan will also lead to a reduction in coarse sediment delivery that causes a loss of rearing habitat through pool filling and channel aggradation by reducing the risk of catastrophic stream crossing failures stream diversions and road-related fill failures... iv.

The project's public outreach/education component will inform the public about integrated canal system vegetation management and ways the public can partner with these agencies to enhance water quality and reduce flood events. The integrated canal vegetation management program will use a coordinated approach for the removal of deleterious vegetation and the addition of native plants to reduce the amount of required cleaning of the canal area. Additional outcomes include increasing water quality reducing erosion and sedimentation reducing the frequency of flood events and reducing the cover noxious weeds. The project also provides an opportunity to create a demonstration site that will showcase the benefits of utilizing native riparian plants to armor the slopes of targeted canal sections. In addition to vegetative work Solano RCD will conduct public outreach to local schools and work with the City to post informational signs to educate the public regarding integrated canal system vegetation management. Over the length of the 1/4 miles of canal debris and sediment will be removed from the canal banks and low-growing rhizomatous riparian plug plants will be installed on three-foot centers from the waterline to the crest of the slope. The plants will form a solid matrix of vegetative cover on the slopes that will \"lay down\" during high flows and fortify the banks from erosion while providing for wildlife habitat and ecological diversity. Future maintenance needs of the targeted canal sections will decrease due to the reduction of noxious weed cover and enhanced growth of rhizomatous riparian vegetation. The native plant installation will be monitored through a partnership between the City of Suisun City and Solano RCD while long-term vegetation management will be performed by the City. ","Project Need: The Suisun City canal system is the last stop for the stormwater drainage system that runs through the City of Fairfield into Suisun City and on to the Suisun Slough and Suisun Marsh. This downstream action deposits debris from Fairfield in the Suisun CIty drainage system and in the slough and marsh. This debris impedes the efficiency of flow as well as creating erosion of locations along the banks of the canal. The influx of non-native plants brought downstream by the drainage has decreased available habitat for native and migratory birds and animals. The establishment of native plants and bank-armoring vegetation will help clean water naturally since they generally have deep roots systems that anchor soil and act as filters collecting dirty run-off separating out pollutants and absorbing water and decreasing flooding. This project will result in improved water quality reduced frequency of flood events reduction of noxious weeds and the establishment of native \"blue thumb\" plants.

","Project Type Description: Drinking water - From underground water mains down to individual house connections changes to the water table from rising sea levels potentially threaten the infrastructure and through increased infiltration pressure the quality of drinking water. Stormwater Improvements- stormwater projects and existing pipes pumps and infrastructure will likely need to be reconfigured to accommodate higher receiving water levels and reduced head compared to current drainage patterns. Habitat Protection and Restoration is a critical concern. County studies of Bayside wetlands have identified how the \"Coastal Crunch\" - the inundation of wetlands on the Bay/Ocean side of new levees could potentially seriously diminish significant wetland habitat if not carefully evaluated planned and managed. On the other hand opportunities have been identified for augmenting current wetlands as a means of absorbing sea level rise over time and attenuating storm surge and waves. Flood Protection must be coordinated with changing Sea Level conditions. In addition to the Sea Level Rise (SLR) modeling that will become available through the OCOF project Marin County's Flood Control program is developing additional detailed flood modeling that integrates SLR data. There will be close cooperation with County Flood control hydrologic engineering work and development of certain structural alternative while this project evaluates broader land use design planned retreat habitat management building code and other strategies.

Sediment reduction and vegetation maintenance will improve channel capacity during the 2-10-year storm events. Improvements to flood protection will improve water quality for the community as the overflow of Easkoot Creek floods a residential community. ","Detailed description: The project is the first of several phases to a watershed-based planning effort. Projects have been identified and are in the process of being modeled for their benefits and to better assess cost-benefits for a suite of solutions. The proposed project is a necessary step regardless of the outcome of the larger study. It has several components that together will improve flood protection and increase aquatic habitat for salmonids. The proposed project includes: a) constructing an interim sediment trap with a large wood structure adjacent to the National Park Service-owned Stinson Beach parking lot to capture sediment b) sediment removal at the sediment trap and at six downstream bridge crossings and c) riparian and floodplain restoration and vegetation removal to improve water quality year-round remove invasive non-natives and to remove obstructions during high flows. Future phases of the project will be identified after the Watershed Program s alternatives analysis is complete in early 2013. ","Project Need: Easkoot Creek drains an area of approximately 1.59 square miles of mostly undeveloped and steeply forested watershed on the side of Mt. Tam. Early maps depicting the proposed subdivision development in the 1900s show the creek channel close to its present alignment until just downstream of the sharp turn at Arenal Avenue. The historic channel then branches off as the channel slope loses its grade and enters a willow thicket (on the current National Park Service land). Early maps show an alternative alignment for Easkoot Creek breaching the sand dunes. With the development of Stinson Beach and the public park Easkoot Creek has been maintained in its current alignment to Bolinas Lagoon. There are three sources of flooding in Stinson Beach: overflow of Easkoot Creek extremely high tides and extremely high surf. Each of these alone can cause some flooding and when combined can cause substantial flooding property damage and public safety problems. The Arroyo and Calle area of Stinson beach are flooded annually during extreme high tide events. Initially when Flood Control Zone 5 was established one of the primary maintenance tasks performed was periodic dredging of the creek. Over time it has become evident that during medium to large storm events an active slide on Mt. Tam releases enough hillside material to fill in the creek even if it has recently been dredged. The essentially flat reach from Arenal to Bolinas Lagoon creates a slower moving creek and a natural area for sediment to settle and deposit. The excessive sediment build-up within this reach of Easkoot Creek has significantly reduced the level of flood protection through the Calle area of Stinson Beach. The private bridges along the residential streets known collectively as the  Calles  have limited to no clearance from the creek during storms which may contribute to the flooding of neighboring homes and preclude access to and from Shoreline Highway. These bridges are a hydraulic constraint but they are the primary access to homes and the primary access for emergency vehicles. The County and Flood Control Zone 5 has spent significant funds to perform limited dredging at the Calle bridges that is typically effective for only one to two seasons and requires dewatering the channel and relocating steelhead trout to minimize impacts. The creek fills with sediment from winter rains resulting in subsurface flows during the dry months. Without surface flow resident fish are crowded in a few shallow pools. Sediment removal will increase habitat year-round and reduce flood impacts to the residents in Stinson Beach. Vegetation work will remove invasive non-natives and restoring floodplains to improve water quality and shelter for fish. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Sedimentation continues to create flooding conditions in Easkoot Creek. Habitat and water quality improvements are critical for Coho salmon and steelhead trout. Infrastructure including homes roads and bridges are subject to flooding and increasing so with sea level rise. Project implementation will begin to reduce the impacts and support the watershed effort to address these issues. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality ... iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... Stinson Beach is subject to flooding from high tides high surf and from overflow of Easkoot Creek. The proposed project will increase capacity of Easkoot Creek by maintaining a channel that passes flows during winter storms. The sediment trap allows Public Works staff to remove accumulated sediment in an easily accessible location and where the sediment settles out as the grade shifts from the steep upslope to a nearly flat alignment towards Bolinas Lagoon. The downstream bridge crossing sediment removal will allow access for residents and for emergency access. Increased floodplain areas will allow for additional creek capacity during storm events. These areas will also provide refuge for steelhead and Coho during high-velocity flows. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) ... The projects are part of a larger County-led effort to plan for the Stinson Beach Watershed. The watershed program will build upon existing studies and develop new analytical tools to evaluate and quantify the extent of flooding and to evaluate the range of proposed solutions. The study and tools developed will provide staff and the community with an understanding of existing conditions as well as understanding how various alternatives could reduce flood damage and restore creek habitat. The watershed program utilizes a collaborative iterative process to develop integrated solutions to flood protection and habitat restoration. The Marin County Board of Supervisors recommended establishing stakeholder committees at three levels to support community outreach and to provide overall program direction: Policy Advisory Committee - This group of elected officials is comprised of the District County Supervisor and two representatives from the Flood Control Zone 5 Advisory Board. This committee provides policy input on program direction and community issues and will meet 1-2 times per year. Operations and Finance Committee- The Marin County Public Works director will use these meetings with Flood Control staff to evaluate progress and prioritize funding strategies and will meet 1-2 times per year. Technical Work Group- This group includes staff of participating State Federal and local regulatory and participating agencies and community members with a science and technical background who will be responsible for the review of watershed products and provide input on issues needs and watershed priorities. This group will include conservation and watershed groups homeowners associations and other technical experts within their respective watersheds. This group has met five times over the last year to scope the RPF and to provide input and to review the development of work products Targeted community meetings presentations at various local boards and homeowners associations and utilization of the watershed program website (www.marinwatersheds.org) will support communication to the community at large.

","Detailed description: The project will remove approximately 50000 cubic yards of accumulated sediment from upland benches of 2.6 miles of Walnut Creek to restore design flood capacity. This will also restore wetland function to areas turned into uplands by sediment accumulation. The Walnut Creek channel was constructed by the Corps of Engineers in the early 1960s in response to widespread flooding of the area. This reach is generally a wide flat trapezoidal earthen channel with a well-defined low flow channel and broad in-channel floodplain benches. Because of the flat gradient these benches quickly accumulate sediment which needs to be periodically removed. This area last had selective sediment removal in 2006 and the downstream reach was sediment removed in 2007. Sediment will be removed from specific selected areas based on the channel cross section and the habitat type affected. Generally the sediment is removed from areas mapped as uplands and wetlands rapidly establish within the excavated areas. In effect the project creates wetlands out of uplands which improving the level of flood protection. Because Walnut Creek is dynamic and sediment level change each season the exact areas to be desilted will be determined by a topographic survey and wetland delineation performed closer to the date of construction. The work is typically accomplished in the dry using traditional excavators directly removing the material and depositing it into waiting dump trucks that drive down to the floodplain bench on temporary ramps. ","Project Need: The latest USACE model shows that portions of the channel in this reach does not have sufficient freeboard to protect the surrounding DAC from the 1% chance storm given new design flowrates. Removal of the accumulated sediment (as well as minor levee raising covered in another project) are needed to prevent catastrophic flooding of the adjacent airport three mobile home parks and other parcels in the DAC.

Trail from bay-front into Hayward. ","Project Type Description: Habitat protection and restoration: this project will restore wetlands around the San Lorenzo Creek. DAC: The San Lorenzo Creek flows through identified disadvantaged areas of Hayward. ","Detailed description: The Tidal Wetlands Restoration Bayfront Park and Bay Trail Connection Project was designed to restore the wetlands surrounding the San Lorenzo Creek in San Lorenzo/Hayward area. A submerged wetland is already forming at the mouth of the San Lorenzo Creek. Wetlands act as living filters that remove pollutants and clean the water before it empties into the Bay. Certain types of plants such as tules and cattails can increase the wetlands' capture of atmospheric CO2 a greenhouse gas. Additional benefits of wetlands include protection from a rising sea level - as decaying plant debris builds up the soil level - acting as a natural speed bump against ocean surges and thereby reducing flooding. Wetlands also provide critical habitats for birds - nesting rearing feeding and migration stop-over as well as other animals. Specific activities to restore the wetlands are described below: 1) Sediment management: excess sediment will be relocated from Don Castro Reservoir to create a wetland at the mouth of the Creek. This project may also help to address the problem of \"upstream sediment\"in the Don Castro and Cull Canyon Reservoirs. Part of the site will be used for sediment management and continued corporation yard facilities. Being close to the South Bay Salt Ponds is also advantageous as excess sediment may be used beneficially. 2) Bayfront park: this park will be created on the south side of San Lorenzo Creek. Breaching the levee and building a bridge over the breach will allow scouring tidal action to help keep the main channel cleared of sediment. The park will serve as a community resource and will potentially feature educational components (wetland education facilitated through short looped trails) as well as a new overlook as a vistapoint created from the excess sediment. 3) Formal San Lorenzo Creek Trailhead: A new trailhead at the mouth of the San Lorenzo Creek will be designed to improve community access to the San Francisco Bay Trail and may establish and strengthen the shoreline as a destination and recreational resource. ","Project Need: The Tidal Wetlands Restoration Project will address a watershed-wide sediment management problem and restore wetlands that are important to the natural habitat. Restored wetlands help protect bayside communities from storm surge associated with more severe weather/climate change. Under this project sediment will be removed from the Don Castro Reservoir to create a wetland at the mouth of the San Lorenzo Creek that may fulfill the following needs: - a partial solution for the problematic upstream sediment in the Don Castro and Cull Canyon reservoirs - sediment close to and for the South Bay Salt Ponds where it may be used for beneficial purposes - recreation through a possible BMX bike course formed from the excess sediment ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: ","Project Benefits: - A new San Lorenzo Bayfront park with increased parking; better access to the Bay Trail; and a new San Lorenzo trailhead - On-site wetlands education - An accessible Bay overlook formed by excess sediment and landscaped with native grasses - Tidal action may be returned to old and restored wetlands that can receive sediment during high flood flows by breaching the north levee - A new \"Bay Trail connecting bridge' where the levee is breached - New wetland plants that help to capture CO2 and contribute to wetland growth - A cost-effective nearby repository for sediment from the the upstream trapezoidal cement channel - Potentially a new bicycle moto-cross (BMX) track ","  "," ","Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District ","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0"

","Detailed description: The City of Belmont performed a study for the storm drain system in the Hillman area. In order to accomodate a 10-year storm event the area will require substantial improvements to the dranage system to reduce the possibility for flooding downstream. There are three alternatives for both the 5-year and 10-year storm events. Alternative 1 proposes upsizing the existing storm drain without any detention systems. Alternative 2 proposes a detention system along North Road including necessary storm drain improvements. Alternative 3 proposes two detention systems (one along North Road and the other within Davey Glen Park) including any necesary storm drain improvements. All three alternatives propose new storm drain systems along Hillman Avenue and North Road (from the intersection of Hillman Avenue and Mills Avenue to the proposed detention system on North Road) and the storm drain upgrades (from Winding Way to North Road through private property).

","Detailed description: Project component would comprise providing a bioswale and other LID BMP measures to manage stormwater on Grant Avenue creating a new multi-use trail connection from Arroyo High School to the Bay Trail and incorporating stormwater management measures into projects throughout the watershed as feasible. Incorporating green streets into flood protection projects provides opportunities to direct and cleanse stormwater en route to San Lorenzo Creek while providing enhanced aesthetics increased community connections to the creek and educational opportunities. Green streets typically integrate bioswales (gently sloped vegetated  ditches ) daylighted creeks (creeks that were previously underground) broad planter strips permeable paving and other natural features into the public right-of-way. These landscape elements direct stormwater runoff to areas with native vegetation hold it to reduce water flow and allow it to slowly percolate back into the soil while being cleansed by soils and vegetation. As a result water quality and flow is improved and polluted stormwater runoff flowing to San Lorenzo Creeks and San Francisco Bay is reduced. Further by reducing demand on stormwater drainage systems these best management practices can minimize the need to construct expensive additional pipe systems. Retrofitting and incorporating green streets provides local jurisdictions a unique opportunity to simultaneously improve the efficiency of stormwater management address critical environmental issues and enhance urban design. Grant Avenue from Channel Street at Arroyo High School to the new Waterfront Park at the Bay provides an opportunity to enhance the street appearance demonstrate a stormwater management strategy and provide a multi-use trail connection between the school and the waterfront. It can become a demonstration green street with interpretive features. Connections through Arroyo High School and the park with the San Lorenzo Creek Trail will form a varied and interesting loop for bicycling and walking. Grant Avenue is already a wide street with bike lanes paths and street trees. The project would increase the tree planter area and include bioswales to hold and direct stormwater runoff on both sides of the street. Car travel lanes and bike lanes would be reconfigured with a new multi-use path added on the north side of the street and a sidewalk on the south side. A key element is that the existing drainage channel on the north side of the street which currently sends water directly to the creek would be converted to a stormwater planter; an additional stormwater planter would be installed between the sidewalk and the parcel line on the south side of the street.

Lynch Canyon is open for public recreation through a contract with Solano County Parks. Lynch Creek is the primary drainage within Lynch Canyon. Lynch Canyon is located just west of Interstate 80 between Fairfield and Vallejo and is accessed off the frontage road McGary Road. ","Project Type Description: Water Quality Improvements will be made by reducing sediment in Lynch Creek which flows into American Canyon creek and eventually Suisun Bay. By reducing channel incision the project will create a more natural functioning creek with increased riparian vegetation and habitat. The adjacent upland grasslands used for cattle grazing has overland runoff to the creek. Improved vegetative buffers will improve downstream water quality by filtering high nutrient runoff and dispersing flow. Flood Protections will be gained through creek flow rate reductions implemented with the proposed structures. With these structures the creek will return to the natural functions of lateral erosion and floodplain creation. The project will restore habitat along the creek length influenced by these structure by reducing erosion increasing floodplain size (diversity of habitat) and increase riparian buffer vegetated width and diversity. Lynch Canyon is accessible to the public through a contract with Solano County parks department. The disadvantaged communities of Vallejo are with a few miles of the project and educational programs and visitors have come from this community for tours and stewardship opportunities in the past and we anticipate visitor ship to continue in the future. ","Detailed description: Solano Land Trust (SLT) is proposing in-stream modifications with-in Lynch Creek for the purpose of restoration of natural stream functions and reducing erosion in the watershed. Based on prioritized projects identified in a 2010 Watershed Assessment SLT has or is in the process of implementing several priority erosion control project in this watershed. The proposed projects are the final uncompleted erosion control projects identified as priorities. The project will construct a cross vane step structure (also known as boulder dissipation structures) below a large road culvert at  Tower Road  which has over 8 feet of scour below its exit. Undercutting of the road is occurring due to this scour. The proposed boulder structures are designed to step the flow through a series of drops reducing the hydraulic gradient and also providing pools for amphibian habitat. The step structure has an approximate 250 feet length within the creek and 20 to 30 foot width. Minimal excavation will be required to place the boulder steps at this location and the construction footprint is anticipated to be limited to the bank area on either side. Three tributary road crossings will also be part of this project. The tributaries have small flow-constricting culverts that will be removed and replaced with a wide pressed rock crossing. The tributary flow will be able to use the entire bank to bank width within the road crossing area and reduce erosion and head-cutting downstream and upstream of this site. With erosion and incision reduced in the tributary sediment flow into Lynch Creek is minimized. Ranch roads are all natural surface roads and it is anticipated that road grading with some addition of base rock within the project areas will occur to provide increased stable drainage will occur. During construction qualified biologists will monitor for wildlife including nesting birds and California red-legged frogs. Recreational and agricultural access to the site will be safer easier to maintain and with less impact to riparian habitats. Upon completion of the construction SLT will restore construction impacted areas by re-vegetating bed and bank and upland grasslands with herbaceous vegetation. This re-vegetation will reduce erosion of these impacted areas and provide plant community diversity to the riparian area. These small re-vegetation planting projects could provide stewardship opportunities to students or other visitors. SLT provides public tours of the property and ongoing projects are explained and highlighted to visitors thus providing additional exposure of the project and funding sources to users and adjacent landowners. ","Project Need: This project is a needed to complete a series of erosion control structures planned on Lynch Creek for erosion control. A 2010 Watershed Assessment prioritized erosional areas within and around Lynch Creek and its tributaries. The assessment determined that a large factor in downstream degradation was due to the road culvert at Tower Road the project site as that culvert confined flow and creates over 8 feet of vertical scour downstream of the culvert. Downstream incision and instability exists that can be remedied with the construction of the cross vane step structure proposed. With the cross vane structure the road will stabilize providing safe access for recreation and agriculture; minimize downstream erosion and increase habitat and vegetative buffers to the creek with stable creek functions. Three ephemeral tributaries of Lynch Creek cross a ranch road used for low-impact recreational and agricultural uses. The small pressed rock crossings proposed will provide safety for visitors less downstream erosion increased creek habitat and low maintenance infrastructure. The project envisions some necessary restoration within the creek and disturbed areas from the construction. The vegetative restoration will provide water quality buffers erosion control and habitat diversity. There is an opportunity to allow visitors including students to assist with planting and monitoring of the projects. Because the project is in publically accessible open space other landowners and the public can view the positive changes in the creek over time with this project. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the project is not implemented Lynch Creek will continue to have problem erosion sites in the middle of the valley that continue to scour the creek downstream and on three tributaries. With projects implemented or planned to be implemented above and below this site the complete restoration of natural creek function cannot be achieved and potentially may unravel the balance of the creek below this point. A second issue is that of public safety. The ranch roads are used as trails for low impact recreation. Road erosion due to the headcutting within the creek and its tributaries pose safety hazards to visitors and maintenance problems for staff. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) This project is not a water supply project however it will promote groundwater recharge by improving riparian buffers and increasing the ground water table in previously incised areas. ii. Water Quality This project will improve water quality by reducing erosion and sediment flow in Lynch Creek which flows into American Canyon Creek which has known steelhead populations. American Canyon Creek flows into Suisun Bay. In the watershed the increased vegetative buffers will allow runoff to be filtered thus reducing nutrients from upland cattle operations. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Stormwater within the watershed will be better manged with the project. For high fast flows during storm events the proposed step structure will dissipate the energy and erosiveness of this flow and promote lateral erosion and creation of floodplains. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) This project is on a publicly accessible open space Lynch Canyon owned an operated by Solano Land Trust (SLT). The property is preserved in perpetuity through grant deed language. SLT strives to use best management practice on this open space to preserve and maintain habitat as well as public access trails. We do this through building up endowments to fund maintenance programs and grant funds for priority projects. The proposed project will benefit the habitat agriculture and public access on the property by restoring a priority erosional location. The property location is in the central portion of the watershed and will positively impact both upstream and downstream creek functions and habitat. Recreational resources will be improved and safer with crossing and tributary repairs. ","  "," ","Solano Land Trust ","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","1"

Groundwater Benefits - This project will mean that less groundwater will be pumped from local resources during the summer months and more of the imported water from the Delta may be used to recharge the local groundwater basin. ","Detailed description: DSRSD and EBMUD formed a joint venture (DERWA) to provide Recycled Water irrigation to customers in the cities of Dublin and San Ramon and the area of Dougherty Valley. The program has been very successful to date. DSRSD produces Recycled Water at its WWTP. The current RW facilities have reached their maximum capacity at 9.6 to 10 mgd. However both DSRSD and EBMUD are expanding the distribution network to new areas; and additional customers are expected to sign up for Recycled Water. The demand for Recycled Water will grow beyond the current capacity or the Recycled Water Plant. This project would build an enlarge the existing pumping station to enable the distribution of the increased RW production to 16.5 mgd. ","Project Need: DSRSD has a successful joint program with EBMUD to provide Recycled Water to commercial and institutional customers for landscape irrigation. The program has 324 customers and has reached its peak capacity of 9.6 mgd. This project will increase the volume of Recycled Water available so that both DSRSD and EBMUD can add more RW customers in our service areas. Peak RW capacity will increase to 16.5 mgd. therefore this Project will reduce/postpone development of new or expanded water supplies amd will replace potable water currently used for irrigation and construction. The recycled water supply would also offset the water supply provided by the Zone 7 Water Agency (Zone 7) from the State Water Project (SWP) which would consequently reduce diversions reduce groundwater extraction and reduce energy use (by reducing pumping). The expanded use of recycled water would also reduce the burden on existing Federal water supply facilities such as the Central Valley Project (CVP). The SWP and VP water contract allocations are closely inter-connected and the supply of recycled water would reduce demand and utilization of those valuable drinking water resources. Recycled Water is a drought resistant supply available all year long and can be stored in existing facilities already built. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Without this project there will be additional demands on the potable supplies provided by the State Water Project and the regional water basin. Thus DSRSD's water supply will be more reliant on the already stressed water resources. DSRSD's water supply will become less reliable in the future with less flexibility and less able to meet additional demands from continued development in our service area. Economic development in our service area will be stunted by the lack of reliable water supply. DSRSD's customers and regional customers will face their water supplies being reduced; with their water bills increasing. In the event of a state-wide drought increased pressue will be placed on the regional water basin; with the potential of salt water encroachment on the basin now used for potable storage. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality ... iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) ... This project will increase the capacity of a successful Recycled Water irrigation project that displaces potable water formerly used for irrigation. This project will help expand a successful DERWA joint venture (DSRSD and EBMUD) bringing recycled water to new areas for additional conservation of our potable resources. Up to 6.5 mgd of Recycled Water will displace an identical volume of potable water. The project stretches the potable water supply of the Bay/Delta region; by replacing some of the potable water from the State Water Project now used for irrigation with recycled water from DSRSD's WWTP. Also drop for drop recycled water used for irrigation is that much less water that has to be pumped out to be disposed of in San Francisco Bay. The RW volume available will increase by up to 6.5 mgd. So the project will result in up to 6.5 mgd LESS of WWTP effluent disposed of in the Bay and the corresponding decrease in electrical energy consumption needed to pump those volumes from the Tri-Valley area to the Bay. By reducing potable consumption this project will help DSRSD as a Water Retailer meet the 20% by 2020 potable water reduction requirements set by state law. It will also serve as a demonstration porject for the beneficial uses of Recycled Water to area residents. With this successful project underway DSRSD and DERWA will be able to bring additional Recycled Water projects to the Tri-Valley area for implementation.

","Project Type Description: The project will remove sediment from the stormwater system repair infrastructure and enhance the capacity of the culvert to accommodate the 100-year flood. ","Detailed description: The subject culvert is an approximately 343-foot long 10-foot diameter corrugated metal pipe culvert. The original culvert was likely constructed in the 1940 s or 1950 s and was extended in 1974. The culvert conveys San Catanio Creek beneath the intersection of Bollinger Canyon Road and Norris Canyon Road. Bollinger Canyon Road is a four lane arterial road that extends between Crow Canyon Road in the north and San Ramon Valley Boulevard and I-680 in the south. The City of San Ramon s police station and the San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District Headquarters and a fire station as well as the City and Fire Departments Emergency Operations Center are located off of Bollinger Canyon Road approximately 4500 feet north of the culvert.

","Detailed description: This project brings stakeholders together with science and map based tools in a collaborative environment to address the following management question:  In the watershed context what are the possible land use configurations to optimally manage flood hazards water supply water quality wildlife and community priorities?  The resulting 'alternative landscape future scenarios' represent different sets of hard choices that flood control water and natural resource and community development agencies must make. The Alternative Landscape Futures approach employs leading indicators of watershed condition measures to develop watershed profiles. For example the past present-day and possible future distribution abundance and diversity of wetlands active floodplains riparian areas and other aquatic habitats in a watershed comprise its past present and future profiles of aquatic habitat. Water quality can be similarly profiled using existing data for contaminants and modeled future contaminant loading. Profiles can also be developed for wildlife species support land use and community measures consumptive water demand and climate. Storm and annual hydrographs when related to land elevations serve as profiles of flood hazards.The Napa Watershed is selected as the most suitable venue for demonstrating the Alternative Landscape Futures approach in the Bay Area because it offers strong local partnerships a wealth of key data and an established means for local outreach. The Napa River is included on the Clean Water Act (CWA) 303(d) of impaired water bodies due to pollution by nutrients pathogens and sediment. Most of the water quality problems in the watershed are due to deleterious land use and water management. Excessive runoff caused by continuing alterations to surface and subsurface drainage result in channel incision bank failure and loss of in-stream and riparian ecosystem services. The current water management practices are reportedly not sustainable especially in the context of climate change. Alternative Landscape Futures approach will enable stakeholders to envision and evaluate landscape planning alternatives together define what is right and possible and aim various policies programs and projects towards an ideal watershed landscape. Although it focuses on assembling existing and new tools for innovative collaborative watershed design and planning this project will directly benefit local regional and statewide efforts to restore and protect aquatic resources. ","Project Need: It s the 50th anniversary of the US Clean Water Act and the aquatic health of our ecosystems continues to decline. Achieving healthy ecosystems will require more effective coordination and collaboration among the policies programs and projects that determine water quantity and quality. This means coordinating TMDL stormwater LID NPS ESA and CESA recovery plans THPs water supply plans mosquito control and flood control. Each of these endeavors is currently driving the conditions of our waters toward different endpoints. Furthermore climate change threatens to shift environmental baselines and nullify existing plans. Significant opportunities for coordination emerge at the watershed scale. What s lacking is a realistic vision of healthy watersheds. If all the environmental policies regulations and best scientific advice were implemented in any of our watersheds what would they look like? What should they look like? Although it focuses on assembling existing and new tools for innovative collaborative watershed design and planning this project will directly benefit local regional and statewide efforts to restore and protect aquatic resources. For the Napa Watershed and its governing agencies and residents this project will provide guidance for watershed-scale adjustments in management objectives as well as adjustments in land and water use to implement the TMDLs in the context of all other major watershed management objectives. It will provide planners a way of testing the efficacy of future landscape options to address a range of climate change scenarios. The choices and their likely consequences will be quantitative and visual. Furthermore the approach and tools will be modular in design to accommodate additional tools. It could include the LID evaluation tool of the Regional Green Infrastructure Master Plan as well as MARXAN for HCP NCCP and advanced mitigation planning under ESA and CESA. Perhaps most importantly this project will provide the web-based tools necessary to generate and format watershed profiles for direct use by state and federal water quality regulators for alternative analyses and compensatory mitigation planning as directed by the emerging USACE mitigation SOP and the CA Wetland Area Protection Plan.

Water quality improvement: Reduces fines sediments and reduces pipeline breaks and likelihood of treated water harming aquatic life. Stormwater improvements: Reduces chronic erosion and risk of catastrophic failures of stream crossing. Habitat protection and restoration: The project will improve habitat for endanged salmonid species by reducing fine sediment loading to fish bearing streams. Flood protection: Reducing stream sedimentation can prevent loss of channel capacity and prolong the useful life of constructed channel improvements intended to increase flood capacity. ","Detailed description: The goal of this project is to implement best management practices on unpaved roads in the Corte Madera Creek Watershed in Marin County in order to meet water quality habitat protection and drinking water reliability goals. The Corte Madera Creek Watershed drains central Marin uplands into San Francisco Bay. Corte Madera Creek supports threatened steelhead trout and once supported coho salmon and possibly chinook salmon. The watershed is characterized by undeveloped and mostly public park lands in the upper parts of the watershed and relatively dense suburban and town development in the lower watershed. This project will reconstruct road drainage on existing unpaved roads on Marin County Open Space District lands. These are unpaved roads with Marin Municipal Water District s water transmission pipelines or unpaved access roads to hilltop water storage tanks. Improvements are designed to reduce the risk of chronic and catastrophic sedimentation and road failures from winter rain storm events. Specific projects sites and recommended design changes roads are identified in Marin County Parks  comprehensive Road and Trail Management Plan. These roads are also important recreational routes for visitors to open space preserves. By preventing road failures on these sites reliability of the MMWD water delivery system will be enhanced because by increasing storm capacity and constructing fail-safe drainage features the likelihood of stream crossing failures for transmission lines will be greatly reduced. Sedimentation particularly from fine sediments has been identified as being detrimental to the habitat for steelhead. Increased turbidity from road-related erosion is a detriment to water quality as well. The road drainage improvements will reduce fine sediments from entering the creek leading to enhanced water quality for stream biota and prevent degradation of streambed habitat conditions. Also reduced sediment will reduce downstream channel deposition and improve flood capacity of the stream. ","Project Need: Road drainage design for unpaved roads have been identified as a significant watershed wide opportunity to improve handle storm water reduce catastrophic and chronic erosion and reduce sedimentation. Most roads in this watershed interrupt hillslope drainage direct runoff on the road directly to streams and have inadequate culvert capacity to handle high flows. Reconstruction of roads is necessary to disconnect road drainage from streams and increase culvert capacity. This work is especially critical for roads that contain major drinking water transmission lines in upland areas or are access roads to critical water delivery infrastructure such as tanks and pumps. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Untreated high risk erosion sites at creek crossings on unpaved roads in the watershed will prolong excessive sedimentation of natural stream systems impacting fish habitat stream water quality and may contribute to lack of channel capacity in flood events. These high risk sites contain drinking water transmission lines. Failures of pipelines due to creek crossing failures in high rainfall storm events could result in negative impacts to biological resources from treated drinking water entering the stream. Also interruption of water supply and access to water supply facilities could result. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) This project will measurably reduce the risk of catastrophic failures of roads at stream crossings by upgrading drainage to 100 year storm event thereby reducing future replacement costs for failures and reducing annual maintenance costs and insuring emergency access to pipelines pumps and storage facilities. ii. Water Quality This project will result in reduction in sedimentation and turbidity in downstream waters. Unpaved roads without storm proofing improvements can increase erosion and sedimentation at a watershed level from 50% increase to four times base line natural erosion rate. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) This project will reduce water quality pollution from non-point sources as described above. This reduction of sediment will also reduce storm related turbidity and impacts to stream habitat for fish. It will also reduce road maintenance requirements and increase safety for recreation users by reducing rilling and gullying on roads.

The results from this Pilot Project will help BAWSCA evaluate whether a longer term transfer arrangement is a feasible and cost-effective way of providing additional water supply reliability for the BAWSCA region. BAWSCA has identified future supply shortfalls in normal and drought years for the BAWSCA member agencies. This information has been developed as part of BAWSCA s ongoing Long-Term Reliable Water Supply Strategy (Strategy) which is described below under the  Parent Project  header. One of the possible water supply projects that has been identified and is currently being developed as part of the Strategy is surface water transfers into the BAWSCA service area. Water transfers appear to be a promising option to address the identified normal and/or drought year needs of the BAWSCA member agencies. However there is a limited number of facilities that could be used to convey water to the BAWSCA member agencies from sources originating outside the Bay Area. BAWSCA is in competition with other agencies for use of the available capacity in these other water systems. There may be a need for BAWSCA to act to secure (at a minimum) transfer capacity in a conveyance system or risk losing that opportunity for good. Further use of these facilities will require the resolution of several technical legal and institutional issues. An efficient means to address these outstanding issues is to conduct a pilot transfer of real water into the BAWSCA service area. Developing a Short-Term Water Transfer Pilot Project would place BAWSCA in the best possible position to enact a water transfer possibly as early as summer 2013 and to make more informed decisions regarding water transfer options and conveyance capacity rights in the future. BAWSCA and EBMUD are working together to develop the scope of work for the BAWSCA-EBMUD Pilot Project which will consist of three elements: (1) development of a Pilot Water Transfer Plan; (2) development of the Agreement to Execute a Pilot Water Transfer; and (3) implementation of a short-term (i.e. less than one year) pilot water transfer. Included in the scope of work for the Pilot Project is the need to better assess the costs and feasibility of such a transfer including questions regarding water quality system conveyance capacity constraints and regulatory and permitting requirements. The Pilot Water Transfer Plan will develop the information and costs necessary to implement a  Short-Term Water Transfer Pilot Project  sometime in the future if both parties agree. The scope of work for the Pilot Plan includes: developing objectives and goals; identifying potential pilot water transfer sources; evaluating the ability to convey transfer water to the BAWSCA service area; identifying approvals and institutional arrangements; developing recommendations for the Water Transfer Pilot Project; preparing the Pilot Water Transfer Plan; and preparing the Agreement to Execute a Pilot Water Transfer. Pending Board action in September 2012 BAWSCA plans to initiate the development of the Pilot Water Transfer Plan and the Agreement to Execute a Pilot Water Transfer at a cost of $135000. This work is anticipated to be complete by spring 2013 so that in the event that 2013 is a dry year BAWSCA and EBMUD will be able to execute a pilot water transfer. The cost to execute the Pilot Water Transfer is not known at this time but will be developed by the second quarter of 2013 as part of the Pilot Water Transfer Plan. Parent Project BAWSCA represents the 26 agencies in the Bay Area that purchase water on a wholesale basis from the SF RWS. The BAWSCA service area encompasses three counties (i.e. in San Mateo Santa Clara and Alameda Counties) and three of the four BAIRWMP subregions (i.e. West South and East). The BAWSCA member agencies currently serve over 1.7 million people in San Mateo Santa Clara and Alameda Counties. This service population is estimated to increase to over 2.1 million people by 2035. During normal years several of the BAWSCA member agencies are projecting a demand for water from the SF RWS that exceeds their contractual allocation from that system by as much as 13 million gallons per day (mgd) by 2035. As demands continue to increase with the BAWSCA service area the need for additional normal year supplies will increase. The need for additional supplies is exacerbated during droughts when cutbacks to the BAWSCA agencies from the SF RWS are projected to be as much as 62 mgd by 2035. In response to the projected normal and drought year supply needs of its member agencies BAWSCA initiated the Strategy in July 2009. The objective of the Strategy is to ensure that a reliable high-quality supply of water is available where and when people within the BAWSCA service area need it. The Strategy is being developed to quantify the water supply need of the 26 BAWSCA member agencies through 2035 identify the water supply management projects that could be developed to meet that need (both in normal and dry years) and prepare the implementation plan for the Strategy. Phase I of the Strategy was completed in May 2010 Phase II A was completed in July 2012 and the final Strategy is expected to be complete by December 2014. The focus of the Strategy is to reduce the impacts to the member agencies from increasing normal year demands that will not be met from the SF RWS and from the drought year supply reductions on the SF RWS. Successful implementation of the Strategy is critical to ensuring that there will be sufficient and reliable water supplies for the BAWSCA member agencies and their customers in future normal and drought periods. Both individual agency-led and BAWSCA-led regional projects are being developed as part of the Strategy including recycled water projects local capture and reuse projects desalination (brackish groundwater seawater San Francisco Bay water) projects conservation and water transfer projects. The specific project presented here BAWSCA-EBMUD Short-Term Water Transfer Pilot Project is being incorporated into the Strategy project development and evaluation process. Implementation of this Pilot Project will create additional supply that will help meet the local and regional water supply needs that have been identified as part of the Strategy. The results from this Pilot Project will also help BAWSCA evaluate whether a longer term transfer arrangement is a feasible and cost-effective way of providing additional water supply reliability for the BAWSCA region. ","Project Need: The BAWSCA member agencies are projecting to purchase as much as 186 mgd from the SF RWS by 2035. Water purchased from the SF RWS constitutes about 60% of the normal year supply to the BAWSCA service area. Eighteen of the 26 BAWSCA member agencies purchase over 90% of their total supply from the SF RWS. However several of the member agencies currently have demands or are projecting to have demands for SF RWS water in excess of their contractual allocations. These agencies will require up to 13 mgd of additional supply to meet these normal year needs by 2035. During drought years the BAWSCA member agencies receive average cutbacks of 18% to 29% on their SF RWS deliveries depending on the severity and duration of the drought events. Cutbacks of this magnitude are expected to occur on average once every 8 to 10 years and to create a supply shortfall in the BAWSCA service area of up to 62 mgd by 2035. Because of how water from the SF RWS is allocated between the BAWSCA member agencies some agencies are required to absorb cutbacks to their SF RWS supplies that are as high as 40%. The frequency and magnitude of these cutbacks will have a significant impact on the residential commercial and industrial customers in the BAWSCA service areas (e.g. it has been estimated that the regional economic impacts of such cutbacks are in excess of $1 Billion in each year of a drought). In order to ensure that there are sufficient normal year supplies within the service area and to mitigate at least a portion of the drought year impacts to the BAWSCA service area the Strategy is currently evaluating the benefits of developing recycled water projects local capture and reuse projects desalination (brackish groundwater seawater San Francisco Bay water) projects and water transfer projects. The Strategy is identifying and evaluating the yield reliability and cost of these projects to develop a suite of new projects to help reduce the overall supply shortfalls during normal and drought years and to reduce the economic and other regional impacts of drought. Some of these projects may be developed individually by a BAWSCA member agency or regionally through a BAWSCA-led effort. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The BAWSCA-EBMUD Short-Term Water Transfer Pilot Project is critical to confirming the viability of using surface water transfers as a means to provide drought year reliable supply to offset supply reductions to the BAWSCA agencies from the SF RWS. In absence of additional drought reliability the BAWSCA member agencies and their customers will be faced with economic and other impacts in excess of $1 Billion dollars per year in each year of a drought. Further if the water supplies that are available to the BAWSCA member agencies are unreliable and subject to drought shortages existing and future customers will be increasingly affected. In a broad sense without sufficient additional water supplies to meet projected future drought year demands residential and economic development could be curtailed within the BAWSCA service area and potentially relocated to other parts of the State or elsewhere. This could result in loss of new housing jobs manufacturing and community services. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) Regional Project Benefit The BAWSCA Strategy provides a regional framework for the evaluation and development of supply projects to mitigate the economic and other impacts of future supply shortfalls during normal and drought years. Rather than looking at just a single project for a single agency the Strategy allows evaluation comparison and implementation of a variety of projects that could create additional normal and drought year supply for BAWSCA service area. Because they are potentially larger scale and more regional in nature some projects being evaluated as part of the Strategy include the utilization of the existing SF RWS to convey the water to where it is needed. The implementation of the Strategy will provide benefits to both the individual agencies that might not otherwise be able to develop their own projects in as cost-effective a manner as well as to all of the BAWSCA member agencies by increasing the water supply reliability in the BAWSCA service area. The Strategy and its associated projects address multiple BAIRWMP goals including:   integrating of multiple resource management strategies;   providing direct benefit to three of the BAIRWMP subregions four of the Bay Area counties and multiple partners;   providing solutions that are technically feasible;   benefiting disadvantaged communities; and   providing for climate change adaptation. As part of the Strategy BAWSCA is working with its member agencies to determine the local and regional desired levels of service to be provided during droughts. At this time it is envisioned that the Strategy will identify a suite of projects that could be used to offset the projected drought year supply shortfalls on the SF RWS of up to 62 mgd by 2035. In addition these projects could be used to provide normal year supply for several of the BAWSCA member agencies to offset the identified normal year supply shortfalls on the SF RWS of up to 13 mgd by 2035. Sponsoring Agency Project Benefit (BAWSCA) The BAWSCA-EBMUD Short-Term Water Transfer Pilot Project is designed to assess the feasibility of surface water transfers into the BAWSCA service area. Yields for water transfer projects may vary depending on the supply source and owner. The majority of sellers identified to date by BAWSCA have available supply in the range of 1000 acre-feet per year (AF/year) to greater than 5000 AF/year. However the amount of transfer water that might be available to BAWSCA and its agencies is currently unknown and will depend on among other things the available conveyance capacity. Based on initial discussions with potential conveyance partners the maximum transfer capacity is anticipated to be about 20 mgd (about 22000 AF/year) during specific time windows with a lesser capacity available in other parts of the year. BAWSCA is in competition with other agencies for use of the available capacity in other water systems with access to surface water outside of the Bay Area. There may be a need for BAWSCA to act to secure (at a minimum) transfer capacity in a conveyance system or risk losing that opportunity for good. Further use of these facilities would require the resolution of several technical legal and institutional issues. An efficient means to address these outstanding issues is to conduct a pilot transfer of real water into the BAWSCA service area. Developing a Short-Term Water Pilot Project would place BAWSCA in the best possible position to enact a water transfer possibly as early as summer 2013 and to make more informed decisions regarding water transfer options and conveyance capacity rights in the future. ii.

Bioretention rain gardens pervious paving and infilltration galleries are some of the techniques that will be implemented to reach these goals. These projects will be used to examine the effectiveness of green infrastructure (i.e. they are expected to provide sufficient information to understand the variability of expected performance for incorporation into agency planning system-wide).

","Detailed description: These early implementation projects will provide a basis for performance required maintenance and standardized details for the City of San Francisco's green infrastructure program. These projects reflect the range of conditions suited for green infrastructure across the westside of the city. There will be three pilot projects implemented across the Westside Basin: Richmond Green StreetWatershed: RichmondStormwater Features: Bioretention & Pervious PavingRedesign a street such as Arguello Blvd. to maximize stormwater capture and infiltration. Bioretention rain gardens and pervious paving have been proposed to do this. The pervious paving will be installed in the parking strip and bike lanes. Sunset Blvd. Infiltration CorridorWatershed: SunsetStormwater Features: Infiltration galleries & bioretention planters This project proposes to redesign Sunset Boulevard to maximize the capture and retention of stormwater using infiltration galleries and bioretention planters. While Phase 1 of the project is only six blocks of Sunset Blvd. Phase 2 will create a green corridor connecting Golden Gate Park to Lake Merced that increases the amount of water infiltrated and the biodiversity of the area while decreasing the volume of runoff entering the sewer system and the amount of water used to irrigate the Boulevard s landscaping. San Francisco State: Sky to SoilWatershed: Lake MercedStormwater Features: Rain Gardens and Infiltration TrenchesSFSU is one of the largest land owners on San Francisco s west side. This project proposes apartnership between SFPUC and SFSU to retrofit the university s main campus using rain gardens andinfiltration trenches designed for stormwater capture water conservation groundwater rechargeand education. Alternative solutions will also be explored during the design process including cisternsfor reuse bioswales and potential creek restoration. Current project assumptions are based ondisconnection of approximately 50% of rooftops or equivalent impervious area from the sewer system. ","Project Need: Today impervious surfaces such as buildings streets and parking lots have covered most of San Francisco preventing rainfall infiltration. Over time creeks were buried and connected to the sewers and wetlands were filled. Instead of percolating into soils runoff now travels over impervious surfaces mobilizes pollutants and washes them into the sewer system or receiving water bodies. During heavy rain events stormwater runoff can contribute to localized flooding combined sewer discharges and the degradation of surface water quality. Moreover the decrease in infiltration resulting from paved surfaces contributes to groundwater depletion. While water quality protection is the fundamental driver behind stormwater management well-designed stormwater controls (i.e. Green Infrastructure) offer many direct and ancillary benefits. Some of the direct benefits include reducing and delaying the volumes and peak flows of stormwater reaching the sewer system. Volume reductions and and peak flow desynchronization can help reduce the number of storm water overflows reduces flooding and protects water quality. These types of projects can also improve the capacity and efficiency of San Francisco's treatment facilities. Some of the ancillary benefits include contributing to attractive civic spaces open spaces and streetscapes. Green Infrastructure also protects and enhances wildlife habitat and the potential to effectively integrate stormwater management into the redevelopment of historic sites. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: These Early Implementation Projects are critical to gain public support for the SSIP Green Infrastructure Program inform the cost/benefit as utility assets and meet the goals of the City and County of San Francisco to revitalize public streets create green jobs and improve wildlife habitat. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) Green Infrastructure includes designs (e.g. bioretention cisterns etc.) that are expected to offset the use of potable water for irrigation for existing and proposed landscapes thereby reducing overall potable water demand. Other types of designs (e.g. detention basins) act as surface storage areas during storm events and can act as open spaces during dry weather. ... ii. Water Quality Green infrastrcture treats stormwater and improves runoff to MS4 areas prior to discharge to the Ocean or Bay. Additionally stormwater discharges to the combined sewer system potentially benefit from the managment of TSS and heavy metals via green infrastructure reducing required treatment at the wastewater plants. ... iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Utilization of green infrastructure across the City will likely result in a reduction of flood waters and combined sewer discharges benefiting the City and Bay Area residents visitors and wildlife. ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The Urban Watershed Assessment (UWA) program is one of the planning processes for the SSIP and will provide recommendations for the Earily Implementation Green Infrastructure Projects noted in this project form - as well as provide critical data for future projects to be implemented over the next 20 years. A major consideration of UWA recommendations are project synergies among City departments and the public to manage natural resources improve recreational opportunities and more use of watersheds as the planning units.

In addition this project protects or restores habitat for over a dozen state or federally recognized sensitive or listed species. ","Detailed description: This project is a critical and urgent phase in restoration and protection of the Springtown Alkali Sink portions of Altamont Creek and the Arroyo de las Positas and adjacent uplands in the watershed. The project would remove noxious invasive plants and initiate revegetation and other restoration activities where native vegetation and stream or sink morphology does not recover naturally after weed removal. It would also help fund efforts by a technical group comprised of land managers with specific experience in restoration and management of alkali habitats hydrologists and plant and animal ecologists to meet and formulate options for the next phase of management and restoration. One of the goals will be to maintain and extend the benefits of this first phase of restoration. These options will be provided to the stakeholders group comprised of land owners local citizens biologists and conservationists to evaluate and implement. Specifically seven species of rapidly spreading invasive plant taxa will be targeted for significant reduction or elimination by the most effective methods that are safe for use in wetlands and sensitive habitats. Final planning and agency and stakeholder review of strategies and control methods are part of this project. Control will require treatment for three years to achieve goals because the target taxa can persist as rhizomes and/or as seed in the soil. Successful control of these taxa has been demonstrated at other sites with consistent and appropriate treatment. The project includes pre- and post-treatment monitoring and assessment each year to ensure treatments are effective and net impact to native species and habitats is positive. The most effective methods will be quantitatively demonstrated and documented to assist with effective restoration in other areas. ","Project Need: Springtown alkali sink and adjacent creeks are widely recognized as globally and locally important for conservation of plant animal and habitat diversity. As with most natural areas in California however the Springtown area has been impacted by adjacent land use alteration of hydrology and invasive species and requires some management and restoration to maintain its important biodiversity values. Most of the alkali sink and adjacent creeks are protected either as Preserves of the city of Livermore or conservation easements or are owned and managed by the Zone 7 Water Agency or the Federal Communications Commission. The Springtown Working Group is a coalition of stakeholders and agencies interested in protecting additional land developing a long-term plan for the system and implementing restoration and management in the area. The Working Group designated control of the most noxious weeds in the area as a high priority and to be implemented as soon as possible. The seven invasive plant species are priority because they are currently spreading rapidly in the sink and creeks and because they typically become dominant in the areas they invade with displacement of all other vegetation. As a result they cause detrimental changes to key habitat attributes for native plants and animals. In addition one of the target invasive plants perennial pepperweed chemically and physically modifies the soil it occupies. These changes could result in irreversible degradation of the alkali sink as habitat for rare plants and animals severe degradation of the characteristic native alkali vegetation and loss of genetic diversity. Almost a third of the palmate-bracted bird's beak population one of the rarest plants at the site is directly threatened by these encroaching invasive plants as are other rare species and plant communities at the site. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If this projected is not implemented the seven target noxious weeds are expected to continue to increase in density and extent in the alkali sink and creeks at a rapid rate especially with a warm wet winter as is predicted for 2012-2013. Changes in distribution of these invasive plants between 2010 and 2012 suggest a doubling of the area occupied by some taxa and perhaps a third of the palmate-bracted bird's beak is immediately threatened. This increase in non-native plants is in turn expected to result in extirpation or severe reduction and degradation of populations of sensitive plants and animals and habitats in these areas. Even if restoration is implemented at a later date the infestations could result in effects that are impossible or infeasible to remediate such as reduced genetic diversity and changes in soil chemistry and structure as noted above. In addition if invasion is allowed to continue more intensive control methods may be necessary which will likely require unavoidable impacts to native species. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality ... iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) This project would provide proactive management of invasive plants which otherwise are expected to continue to rapidly spread in the area. The restoration will occur along approximately 3 miles of creek habitat and over 600 hectares of the alkali sink and watershed. Proactive management will minimize impact to native vegetation and species on additional acreagae by the invasive plants and by the methods necessary to control them as well as save time and money compared to management implemented a few years from now. This project would also allow advancement of restoration of the preserve because the threat of invasion of these most aggressive weeds as a result of other restoration activities will be greatly reduced. This project would also protect the outstanding conservation values of the site. Springtown Alkali Sink is habitat for over a dozen Federally-listed state-listed or state-listed-as-sensitive plant and animal taxa as well as many other species that are regionally rare. It is comprised of excellent examples of habitat types that were once more common in California but are now rare or severely degraded at most remaining sites due to agricultural and urban development and associated manipulation of hydrology for flood control and water supply. It is recognized by the East Bay Chapter of the California Native Plant Society as a Priority Botanical Area for conservation and is indicated in the Alameda County ROSA Project: Biological Resources Report (2003) as a site of high conservation significance. In addition two of the sensitive species known from the site are considered genetically distinct from all other populations (palmate-bracted bird s beak) or all other populations outside the Bay Area (California tiger salamander) which further illustrates the importance of this site. The adjacent creeks and associated wetlands are also valuable conservation sites as wildlife corridors habitat for California red-legged frog and potential breeding sites for California tiger salamander as well as supporting diverse bird life and some regionally rare plant taxa and habitat types. The sink area is also designated as Critical Habitat by US Fish and Wildlife Service for vernal pools and vernal pool fairy shrimp and portions of the watershed are Critical Habitat for California red-legged frog.

The project will attempt to reuse dredge spoils on site to repair levees and create habitat islands and enhancements. ","Project Need: The Hayward Marsh was constructed under dry site conditions in 1980 and has not been dredged or improved since it's construction. Thirty years of operation has resulted in asignificant amount of sedimentation in the interior marsh channels and reduces the ability of the marsh to treat wastewater and provide bird and fish habitat. Islands in the marsh currently support populations of CA least ren and western snowy plover. This project will help significatnly enhance the marsh to provide additional habitat for these species and insure that their existing habitat is protected. The marsh is also currently experienceing levee failures and is in severe need of levee maintenance. This project will completely restore the interior levees of the marsh to insure that the habitat of the marsh is maintained. The interior levee repairs will maintain the treatment aspects of the marsh so the marsh can continue to treat wastewater and reduce the potential for sanitary sewer overflows.

Stormwater Improvements through increased capacity in the storm sewer system. Flood Protection through reduction of historical flooding/ponding in area tributary to the new Charcot Storm Pump Station. ","Detailed description: The new Charcot Storm Pump Station is proposed to maximize the efficiency and capacity of the storm system for a 427 acre tributary area within the Coyote Creek watershed. The design will significantly reduce flooding/ponding within the tributary area. In addition it will integrate stormwater quality and/or hydromodification elements that will improve the quality of stormwater runoff from the pump station tributary area and reduce erosive force effects in the receiving water body Coyote Creek. The project includes the replacement of existing storm sewer pipes within tributary area storm sewer network with larger pipes to accomodate the 10-year design storm capacity install inlets and laterals within the tributary area to ensure capture of all 10-year design storm runoff installation of pumps with a capacity of approximately 300 cfs a portable engine-generator electrical controls and stormwater treatment and/or detention systems to address quality volume and rate of discharge into the receiving water body. The pump station project site may also incorporate a segment of the Coyote Creek pedestrian/bike trail. ","Project Need: The City of San Jose North San Jose de los Esteros Storm Drain Master Plan identified the Charcot Storm Pump Station as a solution to historic flooding/ponding in the area served by the existing outfall at Charcot Avenue (currently a 66-inch pipe). When flow in Coyote Creek is greater than the 5-year event storm water cannot drain by gravity into the creek because the water level is higher than the elevation of the adjacent land. This causes the existing outfall structure flapgate to close forcing water back through the storm sewer system and causes flooding/ponding within the tributary area. Ponding in this area can have a significant economic impact to the industrial uses and can cause potential safety issues along the existing roadways and within parking lots.

"171 ","Alhambra Valley Creek Coalition - Erosion Control and Riparian Restoration Project ","The Alhambra Valley Creek Coalition (AVCC) Restoration Project will stabilize severe erosion along a 1-mile reach of Alhambra Creek; enhance riparian habitat by replacing invasive plants with species native to the watershed; improve in-stream habitat for native steelhead trout; and reduce flooding by decreasing siltation downstream and increasing channel capacity. This project will improve water quality by decreasing suspended sediments and installing LID best practices on the participating properties. AVCC includes an elementary school and the John Muir National Historic Site along with 45 private landowners who are seeking to address severe creek bank erosion and riparian habitat degradation using a watershed approach. This collaboration of multiple private and public landowners to plan a comprehensive stabilization and restoration this one-mile reach of creek represents an innovative approach to restoration that can be a role-model and example for creekside property owners across the state. ","('East Bay';) | Contra Costa ","37.981314406877885 | -122.12249994277954 ","none "," ","This project site is at the Southeast edge of Martinez along Alhambra Creek between Alhambra Valley Road and Alhambra Avenue. About 3/4 of the site is in unincorporated Contra Costa and about 1/4 is within Martinez City limit. ","Project Type Description: WATER QUALITY- Reduce suspended sediments by controlling erosion. STORMWATER - install LID practices and enhance riparian buffers to filter stormwater from up to 45 residences and one elementary school . HABITAT - Remove invasive vegetation from 1 mile of creek corridor and replace with native vegetation; lay back vertical creek banks to create slopes accessible for Red-legged Frog estivation Western Pond Turtle egg nests; Alameda Whipsnake creek crossing to find genetically diverse mates; stream substrate improved for salmonid spawning. FLOOD PROTECTION - Increase creek channel capacity. Controlling bank erosion will reduce downstream siltation that contributes to flooding of Martinez and will reduce downstream channel desiltaltion costs (about $10K every few years) ","Detailed description: This reach of Alhambra Creek is bounded by culverts at each end. At some sites the channel has unvegetated vertical banks of 35 ft height and is eroding laterally. This reach of Alhambra Creek erodes an estimated 250 cubic yards of soil annually. We expect to reduce this by 50% through bank stabilization and restoration of proper channel geometry. In this reach 85% of banks are affected by invasive plants including Arundo vinca and ivy. Because many properties along this reach are on septic systems there is concern that unchecked erosion could encroach on septic system leachfields. The contracted project lead will develop and implement an over-arching riparian restoration for this one-mile reach of Alhambra Creek by working with the 47 property owners both collectively and individually. Community meetings and homeowner surveys began in 2006. A set of 9 preliminary design options have been developed from which specific customized plans will be created for each property and integrated into a single plan that would stabilize and restore creekbanks along the entire reach. The goal of stabilizating the excessive erosion throughout the reach will be integrated with habitat restoration and stormwater management goals by requiring LID practices on each participating property creating or expanding riparian buffers of deep-rooted native vegetation to filter stormwater runoff; expanding channel capacity where possible sloping the vertical banks and using bioengineering techniques wherever appropriate. Erosion of the creek bank is also threatening the gravesite of John Muir. This National Park Service landmark is 30 ft. from the eroding bank edge at the upstream end of this project. John Swett Elementary School at the downstream end has an active eco-literacy program. This project would improve safe access to the creek and allow the eco-lit. program to expand to use Alhambra Creek as an educational resource. This project can be divided into phases which could be implemented in succession as funding becomes available. The goals of our project are to: (1) stabilize and restore this 1-mile reach of eroding creekbank thus reducing suspended sediments that impair water quality and silt up the channel in downtown Martinez. (2) Improve habitat for native animals including steelhead trout red-legged frog western pond turtle that occur in this watershed; and create a travel/breeding corridor for Alameda Whipsnake populations on either side of the creek (3) Replace shallow-rooted invasives plants with deep-rooted natives; (4) Alleviate flooding by improving channel capacity and reducing downstream siltation; (5) Prevent erosion from damaging John Muir's gravesite; and (6) Enhance creekside elementary school environmental studies site. ","Project Need: There is SEVERE EROSION in this 1-mile reach of Alhambra Creek including bank failure and high shear stresses eroding laterally on vertical banks. Creek incision has occurred due to channel constriction hardscape at some parcels and lack of creek access to its floodplain. These conditions are causing multiple problems: 1) The grave site of John Muir and his family -- a National Park Historic Site-- is threatened with damage. The grave is now less than 30 feet from this eroding creek bank. Similar creeks in our county have lost 20 ft in a single storm event. 2) Excessive siltation downstream has contributed to repeated flooding of downtown Martinez and has cost the city many thousands of dollars in repeated desiltation of the channel. 3) This creek bisects two large areas of critical habitat for the endangered Alameda Whipsnake. The vertically incised banks (20-35 feet high in some places) prevent this snake from crossing the creek to find a genetically diverse mate thus isolating and possibly weakening two populations. 4) The vertical banks are unusable by Western Pond Turtles for nesting. 5)Invasive vegetation with shallow or sparse root systems represents 85% of the plant cover in this reach. It does little to prevent erosion and further degrades the habitat for terrestrial and aquatic species. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: 1) Eventually the grave site of John Muir will be damaged by bank erosion. 2)Eroding sediment at this reach will continue to contribute to downstream siltation that reduces channel capacity and increases flood risks to downtown Martinez. The City of Martinez incurs costs of approximately $10000 for each desiltation activity; both businesses and the City incur cleanup costs when floods wash mud into streets and stores. 3Without the ability to cross Alhambra Creek to find mates Alameda Whipsnakes will be limited to a very small genetic pool for mating which could limit this population's future survival. The degraded habitat with vertical banks is inhospitable to red-legged frogs and western pond turtle that could re-establish here if restoration was done. ","Project Benefits: i.

","Detailed description: The goals of this project will be accomplished by improving stormwater through a focused watershed management approach; increase public stewardship through public information and participation programs and initiate habitat quality through monitoring and special studies. The original lagoon was approximately 200 acres in size and served as an Ohlone Village over 500 years ago. Stivers Lagoon is part of the Laguna Creek Watershed whose headwaters begin at the elevation of 2500 feet and drop to sea level within 5 miles. This steep descent is a result of uplifting caused by faulting. Movement along the Hayward fault zone caused a depression oto form in this area. Since large reservoirs of ground water can be found underneath (called the Niles Cone Aquifer) water easily percolates upward in this area to cause a natural pooling of water that existed before present day man-made Lake Elizabeth. Storm waters and springs along the hillsides also bring water into this region. The area had an open lake as a fresh water marsh. As this area became more populated this natural waterway was changed. Areas of the original lake and marsh were filled confining the flow to the existing configuration. For more information on the history fauna and flora of this area please visit the following link on the Math Science Nucleus website with our 15 years of work documented: http://msnnucleus.org/watersheds/stivers/stivergen.html ","Project Need: The purpose of this proposal is to balance environmental flood control and community values; reduce long-term maintenance cost; improve channel aesthetics public use and habitat values; and improve channel hydraulics and hydrology in the Stivers Lagoon marsh complex. Stivers Lagoon marsh complex is a natural part of a constructed flood control area (Lake Elizabeth). The marsh has been significantly impacted by channelization of Mission Creek which is slowly converting from riparian to upland habitat. The silt build up needs to be addresses to restore the complex so it protects homes and businesses downstream in the Laguna Creek Watershed. New acreage has been added because of the removal of one railroad line and the merging of BART line near the remaining railroad BART has built a subway under Lake Elizabeth which daylight at Stivers Lagoon (unclear). San Francisco Public Utility Company is doing significant work in the area as they continue to retrofit their pipes over the complex (now about 60 acres) for increased habitat and flood attenuation through restoration is required. Stivers Lagoon marsh area will require excavation of a shelf from the east bank of the existing siltation pond to an elevation that allows for mash development to increase wetland habitat. The excavation of a bench along the west side of Mission Creek would allow for a riparian vegetation development and increase wetland habitat. The excavation of a deep long pond beginning at the existing pond would improve the diversity of wetland habitat. the controller of Fuller's teasel (Dipsacus fullorum) and bristly ox-tongue (Picris echinoides) by mowing and muching would reduce the unwanted species and indirectly provide more habitats for obligate wetland vegetation. The transplanting of rhizome sections in the new pond would diversify wildlife habitat and could restore nesting habitat for the tricolored blackbird a species that historically used the Stivers Lagoon marsh area. The enlargement and enhancement of the ponds around the kiosk would promote diversity of habitat types that would improve public recreation and education opportunities. To improve access to existing viewpoints and provide access to proposed restoration areas the project proposes the construction of a pedestrian bridge across Mission Creek and approximately 200 feet of new wooden catwalk to connect with the north end of the existing catwalk which needs to be replaced creating a circular path. This path would cross the freshwater marsh habitat near the kiosk riparian habitat along Mission Creek and open water habitat of proposed long pond on the south end. Improved access would allow for human exposure to a variety of habitats without inviting human interaction that may decrease wildlife. Improved public access would require the repair and maintenance of approximately 1200 feet of existing trails through riparian habitat and 300 feet of existing trails through riparian habitat that are parallel to train tracks. In addition the construction of approximately 1000 feet of new path to meet the end of the new catwalk.

The IRWMP will enhance EBMUD's ability to meet the needs of its 1.34 million business and residential customers by providing a reliable alterative recycled water supply that will conserve high quality potable water supplies. TThis project will help to offset demands for potable water by substituting recycled water for beneficial landscape commercial and industrial water uses currently served by EBMUD's supplies from the Mokelumne River which is a tributary to the Delta. During dry and critically dry years the project will reduce EBMUD diversion from the Mokelumne and/or Sacramento Rivers. By increasing the proportion of recycled water used EBMUD will be albe to save a larger percentage of its high quality potable water supplies for residentail and commercial potable uses thereby icreasing regional supply reliability. The project reduces wastewater discharges to San Francisco Bay by reusing wastewater that would otherwise be discharged to San Francisco from EBMUD's main wastewater treatment plant. The project will reduce the amount of water that must otherwise be delivered from the Mokelumne River to EBMUD's service area.

","Project Type Description: Water Quality Improvement: Healthy functioning riparian areas improve water quality by removing nutrients improving dissolved oxygen storing sediment and regulating temperatures among other benefits in urban and agricultural landscapes. Water Reuse/Recycling: A subset of projects utilize reclaimed water as an irrigation source. Stormwater Improvements: Healthy functioning riparian areas improve water quality by removing nutrients improving dissolved oxygen storing sediment and regulating temperatures among other benefits in urban and agricultural landscapes. Infiltration: Revegetaion of degraded waterways can increase infiltration through soil decompaction and increased water retention through root channel passages. Habitat Protection and Restoration: The Watershed Management/Habitat Protection and Restoration (Watershed) Component of the San Francisco Bay Area Integrated Regional Water Management Plan states that \"planting riparian species can enhance breeding and foraging habitats for resident and migrating birds amphibians reptiles and mammals within the region as well as provide litter and shading to the stream channel improving in-stream conditions for fish and other aquatic species.\" Flood Protection: Stable functioning wetland habitats improve flood protection by storing excess water and by reducing shoreline erosion from waves and flood waters. Related to a Disadvantaged Community: Over 1/2 of projects will either directly improve conditions within disadvanraged communities or enage these communities on public lands. ","Detailed description: The STRAW project s goals are to protect and restore the health of riparian and wetland ecosystems in the San Francisco Bay Area; to increase the knowledge of community members in the areas of restoration science stewardship and climate change; and to improve the environmental knowledge skills attitudes and behaviors of community members who participate in the STRAW program. These goals will be accomplished through the implementation of our integrated education and community-based restoration program. The educational component uses local watersheds and inquiry- and place-based educational strategies as the classroom for meaningful and authentic environmental science learning. STRAW staff consultants and partners provide the full complement of services necessary to complete a restoration project including design implementation maintenance monitoring and reporting. In addition we are in the process of fine-tuning our design practices to ensure that our design principles create projects that will be robust and resilient in the face of climate change. Restoring degraded ecological conditions has been identified as a strategy for preparing for climate change (Millar et al. 2007 U.S. EPA 2012). The restoration of riparian areas has been specifically identified because it can enhance connectivity provide thermal refugia and build upon existing resiliency (Seavy et al. 2009). To date restoration practitioners have relied on historical conditions to make decisions about restoration design from engineering to planting palettes. Climate change forces us to reconsider these decisions (Dunwiddie et al. 2009). These  climate smart  designs will ensure that our locally-appropriate native plant palate will incorporate species that (1) maximize the number of months that resources (cover food) would be available for wildlife (2) increase the capacity of the restoration to rebound from fire and longer and/or more frequent periods of drought and (3) ensure there is adequate redundancy of design components so that the resulting project will be resilient enough to handle the climatic uncertainty ahead. The STRAW Project coordinates and sustains a network of teachers students restoration specialists landowners and managers and other community members as they plan and implement watershed studies and restoration projects in Marin Sonoma Solano Alameda and Napa counties. We provide teachers and students from North Bay East Bay and West Bay BAIRWMP regions with the scientific educational and technical resources to prepare them for hands-on outdoor watershed studies including ecological restoration of riparian corridors and wetland to upland transition zones. Since 1993 more than 30000 students have participated in over 400 restorations on rural and urban creeks and wetlands planting close to 32000 native plants and restoring approximately 25 miles of habitat. STRAW has the volunteer partner and landowner/manager commitment coupled with  shovel-ready  habitat restoration projects to implement a minimum of 40 planting days annually in most watersheds within the North Bay BAIRWMP counties providing water quality benefits habitat improvement and positive impacts on economic social and environmental sustainability. Our annual season engages approximately 3500 community volunteers over half of which qualify as disadvantaged communities using the standard of Title I schools in the California State school system and results in a minimum of 30000 linear feet of newly-created habitat. Through volunteer and partner support each planting day brings a minimum of $10000 worth of in-kind match along with a potential for additional monetary match as available. Finally it is important to note that our project is quite scalable in that we can provide habitat enhancement and water quality improvement components at scales from the individual project to the regional level as well as one year or multi-year projects due the deep commitment of our partners and volunteers and our twenty year track record of successfully implemented habitat restoration projects.

","Project Need: According to the 2006 BAIRWMP plan the  protection restoration and improvement of stewardship of aquatic riparian and watershed resources within the region  is a primary goal. Through the STRAW Project this goal is met both through civic engagement and the creation of additional riparian and wetland habitat throughout the North Bay area. As in any large urban region the Bay Area s streams and wetlands have experienced widespread degradation from development impacts such as polluted storm runoff loss of habitat erosion and sedimentation problems invasive species increased flood severity and decreased biodiversity. STRAW s restoration work directly addresses these issues in the San Francisco Bay area using educated and inspired students and community members to create a minimum of 30000 linear feet of habitat annually. This habitat creation will provide the critical benefits of water quality improvement stormwater management improvement infiltration habitat restoration and flood protection. In addition the changing climate necessitates that habitat restoration projects be designed to accommodate the climatic uncertainty ahead. The implementation of our  climate smart  designs will ensure that these projects will be as robust and resilient as possible and will provide the opportunity to educate land managers public agencies and the general public about the importance of these projects as a successful and concrete means of adapting to climate change. The STRAW project addresses the social component of stewardship through direct community involvement with practices that build resilient healthy watersheds. This is a critical component in the Bay Area s success with regards to adapting to climate chance especially with regards to the region s disadvantaged communities. It has been identified that disadvantaged communities will experience more severe problems in the face of climate change (Colten et al. 2008). The STRAW project helps to balance these inequities by providing meaningful and successful opportunities for all Bay Area communities to engage in projects that actively help our communities adapt to a changing climate. The STRAW project is specifically highlighted as an effective means to  address equity by engaging and educate local communities and stu dents and to encourage participation in ecological restoration practices that improve flood protection  (Nutters H. 2012).

","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The STRAW project has been providing authentic habitat restoration projects and accompanying educational experiences to Bay area communities since 1992. If these projects are not supported the opportunity for community involvement in these projects will be lost. The greater Bay Area will lose the motivated effective and supportive workforce of over 3500 volunteers STRAW provides to our various partners and land managers each year. Disadvantaged communities in particular will not receive these services. In addition the uncertain future climate calls for innovative and scientifically sound restoration techniques to ensure that the habitat restoration projects in Bay Area watersheds will be as resilient as possible. These techniques need to be further developed and disseminated to the greater restoration community. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... N/A ii. Water Quality ... The STRAW project will revegetate and stabilize a minimum of 30000 linear feet of creek and levy banks annually. Each planting day will improve water quality through revegetation and invasive plant removal along creek banks and wetlands. Water quality resources will be improved through decreased sedimentation nutrient and metals uptake and cooler water temperatures. Creek and levy banks will be stabilized which will lead to improved flood control and water quality. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... The STRAW project will revegetate and stabilize a minimum of 30000 linear feet of creek and levy banks annually. Each planting day will reduce flooding potential through bank and levy stabilization along with incorporating progressive planting designs that maximize habitat value in relation to decreasing flood maintenance activities once projects reach maturity. Using Avoidance Cost Methodology the authors of Putting a Price on Riparian Corridors as Water Treatment Facilities (Riley et.al. 2009) calculated that  a typical bay area riparian corridor of 4000 feet for a stream with a flow of 0.5 cfs provides treatment equivalent to a physically constructed stormwater treatment plant designed to treat 320000 gallons of runoff per day.  Using the annual value of 30000 linear feet the STRAW project provides the treatment equivalent of a stormwater treatment plant designed to treat 2.4 million gallons of runoff per day. The study further concludes that each 7500 linear feet will provide a cost avoided benefit of approximately 2.1 million dollars. For the annual value of 30000 linear feet the total will be approximately 8.4 million dollars. Literature Cited Riley A. 2009. Putting a Price on Riparian Corridors as Water Treatment Facilities.

Because these wells are critical for the management of ACWD's groundwater basin ACWD began a program to replace those monitoring wells in 1995. Due to limited funds only a few wells could be replaced each year. The general project concept is to install a sufficient number of wells in each of the water bearing supply aquifers to model and monitor the groundwater basin. In collecting accurate groundwater data meaningful evaluation can be conducted and efficient management practices can be put into place. By accurately managing the basin ACWD can assure a reliable and safe source of drinking water.

","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: ACWD's ability to properly manage the basin would be severely hampered.

","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality ... iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) ... The portion of ACWD's water supply produced from wells in the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin has historically been between 30 and 60 percent annually depending on seasonal and annual demand requirements. To assure high quality water reliability and responsible stewardship ACWD performs a delicate balance of pumping and recharging of the basin to operate the basin conjunctively whereby water can be stored in the basin from one year to another. However the amount of storage is limited due to maximum and minimum operating levels which have been established to prevent excessive outflows (if groundwater elevations are maintained too high) and to prevent seawater intrusion (if groundwater elevations are too low). To continue to meet these high goals ACWD depends on a network of wells (monitored monthly or biannually) to supply quality data on the basin. Monitoring of these wells allows ACWD to evaluate trends in water quality use flow storage and saltwater intrusion movement. Loss of many of the wells due to development and age has begun to severely limit ACWD's ability to monitor the groundwater basin on a regional scale. The implementation of this project would allow ACWD to establish long term monitoring points in key areas with minimal chance of early demise due to development.

","Detailed description: The Dublin San Ramon Services District   East Bay Municipal Utility District (DERWA) Recycled Water Plant and Pump Station 1   Phase 2 Project (DERWA Phase 2 Project) will expand the existing recycled water treatment and pumping facilities located at DSRSD. The project will increase existing treatment and pumping capacity by 6.8 mgd. The project benefits the Tri-Valley region which encompasses Amador Livermore and San Ramon Valleys and the cities of Dublin Livermore Pleasanton San Ramon and the town of Danville. The Project is located in the IRWM  East  sub-region of the San Francisco Bay Area in the City of Dublin. This Project consists of expansion of the recycled water treatment plant and pumping facilities. The treatment plant expansion includes: two tertiary influent pumps two flocculation basins five tertiary filters and two UV disinfection modules. Additionally two new pumps will be constructed at Pump Station R1. The additional capacity is needed to serve new and existing demands of water customers in Dublin San Ramon and Pleasanton. The estimated capital cost for the project is $15 million. DSRSD currently produces and distributes recycled water in its service area as part of a joint recycled water program implemented with East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD Oakland). In 1995 DSRSD and EBMUD formed a Joint Powers Authority entitled  DSRSD-EBMUD Recycled Water Authority  (DERWA) to maximize the use of recycled water by implementing a recycled water program that would provide a reliable source of recycled water to serve the Livermore-Amador Valley which includes the cities of Livermore Pleasanton Dublin and San Ramon. In 2013 Pleasanton entered into an agreement with DERWA for the delivery of recycled water. ","Project Need: This project is needed to provide a local reliable drought-proof water supply to the region that will reduce reliance on imported water from the State Water Project and locally pumped groundwater. Water supply in the region has already been significantly reduced as a result of the drought and reduced pumping from the Delta due to environmental concerns. This project is needed to augment existing water supplies and to provide a reliable water supply to meet planned existing and future demands. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: As a region the East Bay Area is designated as an exceptional drought condition according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The DERWA Project service area encompasses the DSRSD EBMUD and Pleasanton water service areas all of which are significantly affected by the drought. The criticality of a supplemental water supply is particularly imminent in the current drought years. The current drought increases the urgency for additional water supplies in the region sooner than anticipated. Since 2014 DSRSD and Pleasanton have imposed a 25% mandatory water use restrictions in their service areas enforced with strict financial penalties. Available water supply to these agencies continue to be hampered by the lack of available supply due to the drought and reduced Delta flows due to environmental concerns. Available water supply in the EBMUD service area is also decreased due to the drought and lack of available supply from Mokelumne watershed. For the second year in a row EBMUD is relying on its emergency drought reserves by diverting Central Valley Project water from the Sacramento River. EBMUD has also imposed water use restrictions within its service area. Upon completion this project would immediately have a recycled water supply available to reduce reliance on the region's overstretched drinking water supply. Long-term reliable water supply for the DERWA partner agencies is predicated on the inclusion of recycled water to meet near-term and long-term water demands. Water supply planning of the partner agencies rely on recycled water as a local sustainable resource to meet existing and future demands including new development that has already been approved. A reliable water supply is imperative to support existing and new local businesses and is vital to the economic health of the community. Without recycled water water demand projections for the partner agencies exceed available supply in future years. ","Project Benefits: This Project provides the following quantifiable physical benefits: 1) Provides new water supply; 2) Improves quality of the San Francisco Bay; 3) Reduces diversions from the Delta and Central Valley Project; 4) Reduces energy consumption; 5) Reduces groundwater pumping.   This project will provide a new water supply of up to 2900 AFY of recycled water. This new supply will reduce demands on the State Water Project by an equivalent amount.   This project reduces discharge of treated wastewater to the San Francisco Bay thereby reducing pollutant discharge to the Bay.   This project will reduce demands on the Delta and Central Valley Project water. DSRSD and Pleasanton s primary water supply comes from the State Water Project via the Delta. EBMUD s primary water supply comes from the Mokelumne River located upstream of the Delta. This project will provide a non-potable local water supply that will reduce DSRSD EBMUD and Pleasanton s demand on the Delta.   This project will reduce energy consumed for the pumping and treatment of potable water and for the pumping of treated wastewater for discharge to the San Francisco Bay. This project will produce recycled water from DSRSD s wastewater that would otherwise have been pumped for discharge to the San Francisco Bay. In addition energy is consumed to pump DSRSD s potable water supply from the Delta to Zone 7 for treatment. This project will reduce energy consumed to pump and treat potable water and reduce energy consumed to pump treated wastewater for discharge to the Bay.

Significant impacts are also anticipated associated with levee improvements needed to address sea level rise. SMART Train alignments cross the upland transitional zone in the area and are driving plans for development of both transportation infrastructure and housing. Mapping: LIDAR data will be used to establish a basemap and select 12 transects for observation. Transects will be located based on physical controls on inundation and potential sources of water and sediment. Representative units include: diked baylands; unobstructed marsh; creek transitions active management (pumping) areas; and areas of natural gradient. Mapping parameters will include: plant communities; soil composition salinity and frequency of saturation; infrastructure controls. Two handheld GPS units will be dedicated to the project for use in mapping both vegetation profiles and water incursions during storm events.

","('West Bay';) | San Mateo ","37.464306 | -122.125472 "," "," ","The project extends along the bay front in East Palo Alto from the San Mateo County and Santa Clara County border north to Highway 84. ","Project Type Description: ","Detailed description: The Runnymede Storm Drain Phase II Project is intended to improve storm water conveyance within the City of East Palo Alto by diverting flows through a 2100-foot long drainage channel that empties into O Connor Pond for pumping into the San Francisquito Creek which flows into the San Francisco Bay. This drainage channel is adjacent to the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge Faber-Laumeister Tract and along the landward side of a levee in an area that contains Salt Marsh with Pickleweed. The project is also adjacent to the residential communities the Weeks and Gardens neighborhoods respectively which according to the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Community Panel Number 060708 0001B is located in the AE flood zone which has flood depths of eight feet. The repair of the O Connor Pump Station Outfall would involve the evaluation of the structural integrity of the O Connor Pump Station Outfall structure and a determination of needed repairs. The structural integrity of the concrete outfall structure has been to some degree compromised by subsurface erosion at the San Francisquito Creek. This erosion has been undermining the support underneath the concrete slab and has caused some damage to the structure. Restoring the support underneath the structure and enforcing the erosion control measure at the outfall are essential to safeguarding the integrity and operation of the O Connor Pump Station. Protection from future coastal flooding is vital to the success and operations of the Runnymede Storm Drain Phase II Project as flood waters from San Francisco Bay that could overtop the current unimproved coastal levees within the City of East Palo Alto would inundate the drainage ditch and overwhelm the O Connor Pump Station. The San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority (www.SFCJPA.org) is a regional government agency composed of three cities and two countywide agencies on the San Francisco Peninsula that are at once divided by the Creek and united by its watershed. The SFCJPA has initiated a process to plan and design the improvement of existing levees between San Francisquito Creek and Haven Avenue in order to protect these communities against anticipated flood events enable the restoration of historic mashlands and enhance recreation by closing a gap in the San Francisco Bay Trail. Separated by Highway 84 the proposed levee protection will consist of two major parts: 1. Improve 9880 linear feet (LF) of inboard levees from San Francisquito Creek to Highway 84 and 2. Construct 11400 LF new inboard levees from Highway 84 to Menlo Park border. The FEMA-designated floodplain extends landward of the levee and includes developed areas. The San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority (SFCJPA) is currently investigating alternatives and conducting design and environmental documentation for several projects intended to provide protection from creek flooding to areas within the 1% fluvial floodplain. Much of the fluvial floodplain overlaps with coastal floodplain of San Francisco Bay in the communities of East Palo Alto and Menlo Park. In order to remove residual risks to these areas and provide protection against 1% tidal flooding considering 50-year projected sea level rise the JPA wishes to conduct design and environmental documentation for levee improvements for this reach of coastal levees. The Project area extends from San Francisquito Creek in East Palo Alto north to Highway 84. These previously separate projects are being submitted as a single project for the BAIRWMP 2013 Update and will be cooperatively managed by the SFCJPA and the City of East Palo Alto.

"189 ","Bolinas Lagoon Ecosystem Restoration Project ","The ecological and physical functions of Bolinas Lagoon have been substantially altered by human land uses which have affected the shoreline and watershed and have resulted in a significant increase in sediment reaching the lagoon. A working group of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council that included Marin County Open Space District the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the public developed a document that identified thirteen recommendations for the restoration and management of Bolinas Lagoon. The critical recommendations of the plan include: 1) restore and reconnect the habitat along the lagoon s edge and upland habitats; 2) remediate watershed disturbances; 3) remove areas of unnatural levels of sedimentation (deltas) from the lagoon; 4) restore eelgrass if suitable habitat is available in Bolinas Lagoon; 5) investigate managing tidal exchange of Seadrift Lagoon to promote tidal circulation; and 6) plan and manage for sea level rise. ","('North Bay';) | Marin ","37.920713 | -122.681468 "," "," ","Bolinas Lagoon is located in western Marin County approximate 10 miles northwest of the Golden Gate Bridge. It is situated south of the community of Bolinas and north of Stinson Beach. ","Project Type Description: The general goal of the Bolinas Lagoon Ecosystem Restoration project is to reduce sedimentation into the lagoon and to restore biological and hydrological functions of the lagoon. These projects will benefit habitat and water quality of the lagoon. The project will also address lagoon watershed issues in a manner that will improve stormwater movement. Finally the project provides for improving the lagoon's ability to accommodate sea level rise. ","Detailed description: The Bolinas Lagoon Ecosystem Restoration Project focuses on addressing human impacts to the lagoon and restoring its natural hydrological and ecological functions. It identifies several recommendations to address human cause impacts to the lagoon. Each recommendation aims to provide long-term solutions rather than short-term fixes. The project recognizes that the lagoon is constantly changing and that the timing and affect of future natural small and large scale events (e.g. sea level rise frequency and intensity of major storms earthquake magnitude and timing) are uncertain and that the best way to ensure the long-term health of the lagoon is to restore the processes that allow it to evolve naturally. A key element of the project is floodplain restoration. The restoration and reconnection of habitat along the lagoon s edge and upland habitat will allow for connectivity between these ecologically valuable areas and allow the lagoon to move inland in response to sea level rise. Other key recommendations for restoration actions include:   Remediate watershed disturbances;   Remove areas of unnatural levels of sedimentation (deltas) from the lagoon;   Restore Kent Island as a dynamic flood shoal island;   Restore eelgrass if suitable habitat is available in Bolinas Lagoon;   Investigate managing tidal exchange of Seadrift Lagoon to promote tidal circulation; and   Actively plan and manage for sea level rise. The project also includes several management recommendations for Bolinas Lagoon including the implementing best management practices removing fallen trees from the lagoon establishing a responsible wildlife viewing program and developing an emergency response plan in the event of an inlet closure. Other recommendations focus on managing introduced species throughout the Bolinas Lagoon watershed such as a rapid response plan for immediate removal of introduced cordgrass and a plan for identification and removal of other invasive species. Management recommendations to protect the lagoon s water quality include: developing a local oil spill response plan replacing toxic-impregnated materials promoting environmentally sensitive use of restroom facilities and identifying toxins associated with the abandoned dredge. Combined these management recommendations will conserve the rich ecological diversity of Bolinas Lagoon and its watershed. Finally the project provides for adaptive management and monitoring program that includes techniques for reviewing and adjusting management practices based on information gained through monitoring. Managing for a healthy Bolinas Lagoon is dependent on the ability to learn and then adapt management practices. Adaptive management is an iterative process that allows resource managers the ability to implement conservation strategies monitor the outcomes and then adjust practices if needed. ","Project Need: Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 The ecological and physical functions of Bolinas Lagoon are influenced by ongoing interactions among sea level dynamics earthquakes and sedimentation. Since the early 19th century human land uses have altered the shoreline and watershed changing the proportion of human-caused sediment reaching the lagoon threatening water quality and altering the rate at which natural processes shape the lagoon. The result is a human-induced acceleration and alteration in the natural processes resulting in a loss of tidal prism and changes in composition of plants animals and habitats. Much of the lagoon s perimeter has been hardened by bordering roadways such as Highway 1 Olema-Bolinas Road Wharf Road and bulkheads at the Bolinas inlet and along the interior of Seadrift. These hardened shorelines limit the lagoon s ability to expand inland in response to rising sea levels. Many of the project recommendations focus on restoring the lagoon s edges (e.g. floodplain recovery and constructing causeway bridges) to allow the lagoon to move inland where possible and to preserve the ecological integrity of the lagoon while preparing for sea level rise. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Analyses of the 1854 T-Sheets and estimates from the 50-year projection indicate that humans will have caused a 1.2 million cubic yard reduction in tidal prism and a shift of habitats from subtidal and low intertidal mudflat to higher intertidal mudflat and tidal marsh. Subtidal shallows will be lost frequently submerged mudflat will decrease by 26% frequently exposed mudflat will increase by 24% tidal marsh will increase by 22% and fluvial delta (that supports riparian forest) will increase by 82%. Species abundance and diversity in the lagoon will change with these habitat shifts. However it is difficult to predict how individual populations will respond to these changes. The high productivity of estuaries is due to the in situ photosynthetic activity of various types of plankton submerged vascular plants benthic algae tidal marsh detritus and freshwater runoff. Shifts in habitats that support these sources in the lagoon s food web will have cascading ecological effects. The loss or conversion of wetland habitats   and reduction in tidal prism   affects the ecological functions of the lagoon but it proves difficult to quantify how these observed habitat shifts have impacted plants invertebrates fish and other wildlife. Eelgrass has largely disappeared from the lagoon and populations of large clams have declined. However long-term data on invertebrates and fish are lacking making it difficult to assess how shifts in habitat have affected populations of these taxa. Species that depend on specific habitats are expected to either increase or decrease depending on the trends in habitat loss or gain. For example one-third of the 99 invertebrates listed as occurring in the lagoon are associated with subtidal and frequently submerged mudflat areas and are expected to experience declines as their habitat areas decrease. Similarly decreases in deeper water habitat will reduce foraging habitat for two feeding guilds of diving birds (fish-eating and benthos-feeders) and most of the 38 species of fish known to occur in the lagoon. Some shorebirds are expected to lose habitat while others will gain. Marsh bird populations are expected to benefit as are migratory and resident land birds by the increase in marsh and riparian forest habitats. For example an increase in brackish marsh will benefit the state-threatened California black rail the salt-marsh common yellowthroat   a state and federal Species of Concern and the marsh wren. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality The project will remove sediment sources from the lagoon watershed on several drainages and will remove accumulated sediment within the stream deltas. Project has also identified and recommends removal possible pollution sources within the lagoon. Finally project includes working with adjacent private landowners to reduce sedimentation into the streams draining into the lagoon. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management The project includes several measures to address sea level rise. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The primary purpose of the project is to restore habitat within the lagoon through the removal of accumulated sediment restoration and protection of the watershed removal of non-native invasive species and restoration of riparian habitat wetlands and streams. Although not designed to improve recreation the lagoon and its surrounding lands are primarily owned by the Marin County and National Park Service and are available for public use. The restoration projects will not reduce public access opportunities and will enhance the recreational experience. ","  "," ","Marin County Open Space District ","0","1","0","1","0","0","1","0"
"190 ","Upper Napa River Water Quality Improvement and Habitat Enhancement Project ","This project will implement restoration along 4.6 miles of the Upper Napa River to address channel erosion a pollutant source identified in the Napa River Fine Sediment TMDL. Other reaches of the Napa River have undergone similar plans including the Rutherford Reach (Zinfandel Lane to Oakville) and the Oakville to Oak Knoll reach. This project will address the Upper Napa River from Lincoln Ave. in Calistoga to Bale Lane near St. Helena. A multi-disciplinary team is assessing geomorphology riparian ecology and fisheries as well as conducting outreach to private landowners to define a prioritized set of actions to address high velocity flows due to channel entrenchment. Entrenchment increases erosion of the channel resulting in scouring of bedforms (riffle pools and gravel bars) needed by salmonids and loss of riparian forest and shade canopy. Channel erosion due to entrenchment is identified as a major source of fine sediment pollution in the Napa River and a limiting factor for salmonid habitats. Restoration will encompass up to 20 acres of new riparian and instream habitats with a focus on the confluences of major tributaries and the river channel and major eroding banks. ","('North Bay';) | Napa ","38.561 | -122.522 ","6/1/2014 ","10/31/2018 ","4.6 miles of the Upper Napa River from Lincoln Ave. bridge on the southern end of Calistoga to Bale Lane near St. Helena. ","Project Type Description: Water Quality Improvement Unlike many watersheds where the sediment is primarily generated from land uses on hillslopes the Napa River is also impaired by sediment from channel erosion driven by a drop in the bottom elevation of the river channel. This drop in base level migrates backwards up every tributary and drainage ditch until hard rock or another type of grade control is reached. This process is increasing fine sediment pollution and damage to properties and habitat. This project focuses on widening the main river channel to reduce water velocities and thus stop any further drop in the river s base level and the subsequent long term sediment generation it causes. Habitat Protection and Restoration The physical form of the channel translates to healthy aquatic and riparian habitats. The riparian ecosystem needs complex channel habitats to regenerate new trees to replace older trees that erode into the water to provide for a diversity of tree species and to produce the physical heterogeneity of plant growth forms (trees shrubs vines and herbs) needed to support fish and wildlife. This project addresses the cause of poor habitat: a narrow and deep channel with high velocity erosive flood flows. The channel needs a larger area where flows can spread out and slow down. The project reach is rural and includes the confluence of numerous tributary creeks of importance to steelhead trout. ","Detailed description: The Napa River is one of the only large watersheds in the San Francisco Bay Area which remains in a rural state. The Napa River has been rated as one of five anchor watersheds for salmonid habitat restoration (CEMAR 2006). With agricultural uses protected and urbanization limited by local zoning the Napa River has the potential for restoration with long-term benefits to riparian and aquatic habitats. Steelhead trout and Chinook salmon spawn and rear in the drainage with Chinook primarily using the river channel. In 2012 the California Land Stewardship Institute (CLSI) received funding from the California State Water Resources Control Board to prepare a habitat enhancement and water quality improvement plan for 4.6miles of the Napa River between the Lincoln Ave. Bridge and the Bale Lane Bridge in the upstream area of the Napa River. The Upper Napa River suffers from channel incision with bank collapse erosion of riffles bars and pools important to salmonids and a reduced riparian corridor due to the lack of a functional floodplain. As the river erodes its bed and deepens the 20 foot banks collapse directly contributing fine sediment to the river and impairing beneficial uses. The incision of the main river channel is now progressing up tributaries increasing erosion and loss of habitat. There are four large municipal dams on major tributaries to the Napa River. Dams block sediment movement and release flood water that has a greater capacity to erode the river channel. The Kimball Reservoir is a large municipal reservoir which affects this reach. Additionally prior to settlement parts of the project area of the Napa River were dominated by wetlands fed by distributary channels from alluvial fans on tributaries. Over time the distributary channels were converted to more efficient drainage channels and the wetlands were drained and farmed. Removal of vegetation and gravel bars elimination of multiple river channels and riprap bank stabilization also took place along the mainstem. Extensive data collection fieldwork and analysis will inform the final concept plan. LIDAR topographic data for the Napa River from Napa County is being collected along with surveyed cross sections. Geomorphic features are being mapped using GPS/GIS technology. Changes in the width and form of the channel the loss of secondary channels changes in the amount of exposed gravel and the width of the riparian corridor were reviewed on historic aerial photographs. A riparian ecosystem assessment is being completed by defining geomorphic units for mapping vegetation mapping riparian vegetation by species and size class and analyzing biodiversity size class dominance and successional stage. The relative number of the four size classes and distribution of size classes over different morphological areas in the corridor indicate regeneration level and ecological successional processes. The mapping found that in a number of locations there was little to no regeneration of riparian growth largely due to the incision in the channel and the high velocity flows. A fish habitat assessment is also being completed in accordance with the methodology presented in the California Salmonid Stream Habitat Restoration Manual. The restoration plan will widen the river channel and recreate floodplains and secondary channels in select locations giving the Napa River a morphology closer to its pre-settlement condition. By widening the river channel and restoring floodplains ecological processes can create a diverse set of habitats including salmon habitat and reduce erosion of the river channel. Up to 20 acres of new habitat will be created. High medium and low priority restoration areas are being identified where the greatest increase in habitat values and largest areas of habitat can be attained. These areas were determined using parameters of multiple conditions of the river s riparian ecology biodiversity and geomorphology (existing side channel secondary channel functional floodplain areas eroding banks areas with low width to depth ratios over simplified channels and locations of high medium and low channel complexity). Lower priority areas are designated where habitat recreation will require much greater levels of effort and funding. In higher priority areas a strategy is in place for banks to either be setback to provide a grade that is sustainable or provide for passive retreat in which the banks are allowed to fail to avoid overly disturbing the area. Floodplain re creation will help floodwaters spread out and thus slow down create flood refuge areas at creek confluences create off channel habitats for salmonids increase large wood in the channel and reduce property damage from erosion. Passive retreat is a post flood response action to replace the typical practices of hardening banks and dumping rock into the channel to  stabilize  any bank erosion or channel adjustment. Because the land ownership along the river is entirely private the project will involve landowner cooperation for access and changes to land use adjacent to the restoration areas. CLSI has relationships with landowners to ascertain restrictions as well as areas open to change. This plan will implement the Fine Sediment TMDL for the Napa River. The erosion in the channels of the Napa River and its tributaries is identified as a major sediment loading source for the valley area of the watershed. The TMDL documents include specific guidance regarding channel erosion the fine sediment source directly addressed by this proposed plan:  Of all the sediment source categories channel incision has the highest priority for source reduction and control because sediment input from channel incision is produced locally and therefore may have a greater effect on fine sediment deposition at spawning and rearing sites in the Napa River than more remote sources of sediment delivery.\" This project provides a comprehensive approach to the channel erosion problem on 4.6 miles of the Napa River.

","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Channel erosion produces direct delivery of fine sediment into stream flow. The Napa River channel has entrenched up to 20 ft. Entrenchment of the main river channel involves downcutting of the channel bed into the alluvial valley. As the channel deepens flood flows are confined to the channel increasing erosion. If the proposal is not implemented the channel will continue to be disconnected from its floodplain on the valley floor. Water quality aquatic and riparian habitats would continue to all be degraded by the entrenchment process. River banks will fail adding more sediments to the river and floodwaters will create damage to properties. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) By widening the river channel and slowing the velocity of the flow groundwater recharge will increase. ii. Water Quality The project will provide a major improvement in water quality. The Napa River TMDL for fine sediment identifies channel erosion as a major source of this pollutant and recommends channel widening and floodplain creation to reduce this source of sediment. This project would provide for needed improvements in water quality. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Widening the channel will slow flood flows for the 2 and possibly 5 year frequency flood events. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) This project involves numerous private agricultural and residential landowners who are willingly dedicating land to the restoration effort. As part of the project a Benefit Assessment District is proposed that will provide funds to the Napa County Flood Control District to manage both the created habitat areas and existing habitat areas along the 4.6 mile river reach and remove invasive non native plants and repair bank erosion sites while maintaining large wood in the channel. Additionally a Technical Advisory Group of agencies landowners local environmental groups and scientists will over see the project design and increase their knowledge of large scale restoration projects.

","Detailed description: The proposed project will install shallow groundwater monitoring facilities and groundwater and surface water instrumentation at up to six locations adjacent to (within one-quarter mile of) the Napa River system. Each site is planned to include the following features:   Two nested piezometers at different depths installed in a single borehole and equipped with automated data collection instrumentation to continuously record groundwater levels and basic water quality parameters of temperature and electrical conductivity;   Located near an existing stream gauging station and/or near an area where stream stage and water quality monitoring can be conducted;   Located in the vicinity of existing groundwater monitoring facilities (i.e. typically water supply wells constructed to greater depths in the aquifer system); and   Located on property readily accessible to the County for construction of the proposed facilities access for data collection and ongoing monitoring following the grant period. The proposed monitoring wells constructed near the monitored surface waterway will provide dedicated monitoring sites for collection of water elevation and quality data to identify and characterize interactions between groundwater and surface water resources. Constructing new monitoring wells will provide controlled groundwater monitoring locations with detailed lithologic and construction details that can be used for long-term data collection and monitoring as funding allows. The proposed monitoring wells will be among the first monitoring wells constructed in the County to address high priority groundwater data gaps already identified.

The proposed monitoring wells will be among the first monitoring wells constructed in the County to address high priority groundwater data gaps already identified. ","Project Need: The proposed project will facilitate improved understanding of the manner in which the stream/aquifer system responds to utilization of the County s surface and groundwater resources and the potential effects due to climate change. The proposed groundwater monitoring facilities and the instrumentation proposed to be installed at the groundwater monitoring locations and at stream monitoring stations (existing and/or new stations) will help quantify exchanges of water between the surface water channel and the adjacent shallow alluvial aquifer sediments. The proposed facilities will also provide the data that will improve the information used to assess the status of the County s surface and groundwater resources and will provide for improved forecasting of future supplies and effective management of water resources. The extent and nature of groundwater/surface water interactions in Napa County are largely unknown along the Napa River. Groundwater levels throughout much of the Napa Valley are within 5 to 20 feet during times of seasonally high groundwater levels in the spring. These shallow groundwater conditions may result from a close hydraulic connection between groundwater and surface water stream channels for at least part of the year; however little or no data exist to discern this relationship. In a closely connected groundwater and surface water system relatively small changes in groundwater levels have the potential to greatly influence surface water resources. During periods of low flow groundwater level declines could result in decreasing stream baseflow conditions. Given the increasing pressure on natural resources and land use and since it is important to better understand water resource availability to meet projected increases in annual water demands monitoring of near-stream shallow groundwater conditions in key locations will contribute to this understanding. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The groundwater information is needed immediately because of findings in the 2050 Napa Valley Water Resources Study (West Yost Associates 2005 see http://www.napawatersheds.org/app_pages/view/4282). The 2050 Study was based on data received from the various agencies and other sources and used a combination of population projections and land-use projections to estimate the potential future water demands. The results of the 2050 Study illustrate the need for integrated water resources planning on a countywide basis. Based on estimated surface and groundwater supply availability (the certainty of which was constrained in many areas due to data limitations) the study indicated supply deficits for the Main Basin (includes the incorporated and unincorporated areas in the vicinity of Calistoga St. Helena Yountville Napa and American Canyon) for multiple and single-dry water years and projected deficits for 2020 and 2050 for all water year types. Specifically the study predicted that the unincorporated water demand in the Main Basin will exceed the available supply by 1340 acre-feet per year (afa) in 2020 and by 5640 afa in 2050. By improving the groundwater level monitoring network the potential increased demand on the groundwater basin and any potential for associated effects on surface water can be accurately assessed. The additional information on stream/groundwater exchange provided by the proposed facilities will be needed to make informed groundwater decisions in the future and ensure water resources sustainability for the natural environment and future generations. The proposed facilities will also improve forecasting of future supplies and effective management of water resources. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) The proposed groundwater monitoring facilities and the instrumentation proposed to be installed at the groundwater monitoring locations and at stream monitoring stations (existing and/or new stations) will help quantify exchanges of water between the surface water channel and the adjacent shallow alluvial aquifer sediments.

","Detailed description: This project is a regional collaborative effort of the Bay Area water agencies and will leverage and expand the implementation of existing water conservation education and consumer incentive program and build on regional waster conservation initiatives. The Program includes a suite of program elements that promote high-efficiency technologies and best water conservation practices to improve indoor and outdoor water use efficiency thoughout the San Franciscso Bay Area. The specific program elements are proposed that will provide quantifiable and sustainable water savings including: 1) High-Efficiency Toilet and Urinal Direct Installation and Rebates 2) High-Efficiency Washer Rebates 3)Water-Efficient Landscape& Irrigation How-To Education Video projects 4) Water-Efficient Landscape and Weather-Based Irrigation Controller Rebate and 5) Large Landscape Irrigation System Retrofit for Recycle Water. Participating agencies will develop design and print marketing materials specific to the participating program and region. Agencies will have the flexibility to collaborate to ensure consistent messaging throughout the region. Customer will purchase and install qualifying product and submit rebate application to participating agency. Each agency will review and evaluate customer rebate application. An agency may require a purchase receipt and/or post inspection prior to issuing a rebate. Rebates will be issued in the form of a check or water credit on the customer water bill. Public Outreach may include customer and retailer marketing and public outreach activities will be conducted to implement the incentive program and verification process. Specific activities include outreach to retailers publishing rebate materials and postcards associated with the distribution of the incentives. For each high efficiency hardware install is quantifiable water savings based on manufactures lifetime water savings data. Combined these program elements target significant indoor and outdoor end uses of water in residential commercial and institutional sectors and meet the Best Management Practices required by California Urban Water Conservation Council the Demand Management Measure required by Department of Water Resources Urban Water Management Plan and the meet the requirements of SBX7-7 Water Conservation Bill. ","Project Need: The purpose of the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Water Conservation Program is to improve water use efficiency provide drought relief benefits and improve long-term water supply reliability to the San Francisco Bay Area Region in response to recent dry years and other strains on Bay Area water supplies and the Delta. As water shortages and increasing demands upon infrastructure occur throughout the state emphasis upon regional and local water conservation planning technologies and practices is paramount. New technologies and methodologies are evolving at an unprecedented rate. Water agencies and local governments throughout the San Francisco Bay Area currently have limited financial resources to meet the challenge for increasing water conservation. Agencies need additional support to ensure that staff resources and financial incentives are available to address the water supply challenge and educate the public about what options are available to realize water conservation goals. This project provides project participants the flexibility to select the most appropriate programs to provide drought relief locally or sub-regionally and ultimately achieve water conservation regionally through collaboration with other agencies and educational programs. Recent legislation namely SBx 7-7 mandates the implementation of water efficiency measures regardless of cost-effectiveness. Water agencies and local governments throughout the San Francisco Bay Area currently have limited financial resources to meet the challenge for increasing water conservation. Agencies need additional support to ensure that staff resources and financial incentives are available to address the goals mandated by SBx 7-7. High-Efficiency Toilet and Urinal and Direct Install Program (HET HEU); The average costs for HET/HEUs are considerably more than for moderately priced standard toilets/urinals. Bridging the cost difference with a rebate or a direct-install program will increase demand for HET/HEUs and thus begin to transform the market. High-Efficiency Washer (HEW): Funding for this project element will maintain the momentum of an existing Regional High-Efficiency Washer incentive offer. The end use of water for clothes washing with standard washing machines is approximately 25 percent of indoor water use. HEWs reduce water consumption for clothes washing by approximately 50 percent and energy consumption by 60 percent. Landscape Rebate Program: More than half of urban water use throughout the Bay Area is for landscape irrigation. Of that the majority of the water is used to irrigate lawns. Lawns also require regular mowing which results in greenhouse gas emissions from mechanized landscape maintenance. Lawn irrigation often results in run-off which delivers pollutants to local creeks and streams. Weather-based Irrigation Controllers: The typical home irrigation system is only about 40-50% efficient meaning half of the water applied to the landscape is wasted not benefiting the plants and results in run-off or non-point source pollution. Improving water irrigation efficiency is perhaps the single most important goal for water conservation professionals. Large Landscape Irrigation System Retrofits: Enable utilities to provide financial incentive to customers with large landscapes and failing outdated irrigation systems to make critical hardware improvements and reduced water consumption. This program will also include customer hardware irrigation retrofits for customers converting irrigation systems from potable water to recycle water a direct offset of potable water in the region. Landscape & Irrigation How-To Educational Video Project: Landscape irrigation accounts for approximately 50% of urban water use in California. This is and will be a primary focus for water conservation throughout California for the next several decades. In addition the amount of water waste in landscape is staggering. Problems such as overspray onto pavement leaking valves blocked sprinkler heads improper scheduling broken drip lines and more are common in residential landscapes. The initial concept for this project was to search for videos that were already on the internet. However what we found was that like most items on the internet many of the how-to videos on the internet provide incorrect information or they didn t capture the key concepts needed. Water agencies determined that by collaborating on this project the instructional videos could be completed correctly and cost effectively and they could be provided to our collective customers. This project will result in water savings reduced property and landscape damage reduce water run-off which eventually ends up in local streams. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Without this project water supply reliability is uncertain and there will continue to be stains on Bay Area water supplies and Delta. Recent dry years water supply shortages and increasing demands upon water and wastewater infrastructure elevate the need to emphasize regional and local water conservation planning technologies and practices. Water agencies and local governments throughout the San Francisco Bay Area currently have limed financial resources and need additional funding to ensure that educational resources and financial incentive are available to address the water supply challenge. This Program will support the conservation component of each agency's Future Water Supply Plan and their Urban Water Management Plans is consistent with the Statewide MOU's Best Management Practices and the San Francisco Bay Area Integrated Regional Water Management Plans and will support meeting the Governor's water conservation goal of 20 percent reduction by 2020(SBX7-7). ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.)Being able to support e ... ii. Water Quality ... iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) Water Quality   Potential and anticipated water quality benefits derived from reducing the amount of water used by customers in the Agencies  water supply areas including providing flow to improve aquatic ecosystems and the habitat restoration of many Federally listed species; Statewater Harvest Mouse California Clapper rail Delta Smelt Splittail Steelhead Chinook salmon fresh water shrimp and Coho Salmon. Instream Flow   Reduce urban demand for water from the Bay-Delta and Tuolumme River will provide greater instream flow. Water Quality   Additional water quality benefits to the State will result due to reduced diversions[r1] for the Tuolumne River system that supplies the greater San Francisco area and a proportional reduction in waste water discharges into streams and bays regionwide. Reduced wastewater discharges also improve the water quality locally. Water Supply Reliability   Agencies each have water conservation plans that call for future water shortages based on current projected demands. SBX7-7 new law mandates Agencies to evaluate water supply reliability and to reduce per capita water consumption 20% by 2020. The water use efficiency improvements are necessary in this region are directly connected to the water savings attained through this program. Supply and Demand: Agencies who rely on Delta-Conveyance will reduce their demand on state water pumping that has be subject to court order reduction due to their impact on the eco-system habitat. Environmental Stewardship: Marketing will highlight the environmental benefits of water conservation and programs like the landscape video education and will strongly support a holistic approach to natural resource conservation and directly engage participants in energy reduction pollution prevention habitat preservation and other environmental actions. Removal of lawn utilizing the Sheet mulching along with other key ecological practices with recycled content cardboard compost and mulch covers the lawn in place eliminating the need to use herbicides or to remove trasport and landill the turf increasing the organic matter and the water holding capacity of the soile. Regional collaboration Among Independent Agencies   Legal agreements between the Agencies to partner in cost sharing in the implementation of their programs will continue to exist for water efficiency. Over the past two years there is great success with the current High-Efficiency clothes washer program. A total of 623 acre-feet of water have been saved due to the existing program.

The project addresses Water Quality Improvement by monitoring temperature pH dissolved oxygen and other water quality parameters to identify where and how water quality improvements should be best directed. Instream flow has been designated The monitoring project will benefit habitat protection and restoration by informing effective adaptive management for aquatic species habitat. ","Detailed description: The San Gregorio Creek Tributary Monitoring project is proposed to take place in 6 San Gregorio Creek tributaries including El Corte De Madera Creek Bogess Creek Harrington Creek La Honda Creek Alpine Creek and Mindego Creek. The tributaries proposed for monitoring encompass all perennial tributaries and four of five subbasins in the San Gregorio Creek Watershed. Tributary monitoring will consist of instream flow and temperature monitoring stations in each tributary over the low-flow season and monthly WQ spot-checks of each tributary monitoring location occurring throughout the year. The San Gregorio Creek Tributary Monitoring project will facilitate effective water management and conservation in the watershed better quantify water quality for both the human community and aquatic species and contribute to habitat protection and restoration for Central Coast steelhead and Central California Coast coho among other species. Instream flow monitoring will consist of installing a Hobo Water Level Logger and taking flow measurements using a portable velocity meter. The water level and flow measurements will be used to set up a discharge rating curve to estimate flow during the low-flow season. Concurrent temperature readings will provide further information on habitat suitability for aquatic species. Water quality spot-checks of each tributary monitoring location will occur monthly throughout the year using a YSI Multi-parameter hand held meter hach turbidity meters and chemical test kits to measure dissolved oxygen pH specific conductance barometric pressure and turbidity. ","Project Need: While flow and habitat monitoring efforts are underway for the mainstem of San Gregorio Creek current monitoring and conservation efforts in the San Gregorio Creek Watershed do not address the need for a cohesive long-term monitoring strategy for tributary water quality or streamflow inputs. Flow monitoring in San Gregorio Creek tributaries will help prioritize water conservation efforts in the drainage contributing to future water supply sustainability for the local community as well as improving habitat for aquatic species in the San Gregorio Creek Watershed. Low flow in San Gregorio Creek and its tributaries has been recognized as the primary water issue in the drainage by both agencies and the local community. Climate change is likely to exacerbate water availability in the dry season this making this project an important part of future planning efforts. The project will facilitate updating the San Gregorio Environmental Resource Center's established citizen monitoring program to reflect current watershed management needs and goals including promoting water conservation strategies quantifying limiting factors to future water supply sustainability and salmonid reintroduction and involving the community in water management. Aquatic species of interest in the San Gregorio Watershed include CCC coho and steelhead among others. San Gregorio Creek was ranked third in the State of California to develop instream flow requirements by CDFG. The recently released NMFS Draft Recovery Plan for CCC Coho Salmon identified the San Gregorio Creek Watershed as one of 28 focus watersheds for their recovery. CDFG has also designated San Gregorio as one of 9 watersheds for CCC coho re-introduction. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: SGERC's citizen monitoring program is the only watershed group in the San Gregorio and the major source of both watershed education as well as networking on environmental issues land use planning and restoration. The proposed project will allow updating of the current volunteer monitoring program to reflect current needs. The cost of updating the current watershed volunteer program to fill data gaps and answer water conservation restoration and land use planning questions so projects in the area are conducted in an informed effective manner is more cost effective than hiring outside consultants and also empowers the community. To do this funds are needed to purchase and maintain monitoring equipment and hire a project coordinator. In addition the project will provide information on San Gregorio Creek tributaries allowing water management to have a basinwide approach. The partnerships with other groups like American Rivers and CEMAR working in the San Gregorio Creek Watershed will allow education of the local community to better steward the local water resources.

Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) By identifying flow status in the largest tributaries in the watershed the project addresses drinking water supply by identifying where water conservation strategies such as forbearance tank programs and water conservation education can be best directed thus contributing to long-term sustainability of drinking water in the watershed. Employing citizen monitoring and educating local efforts will contribute to data collection and analysis needs informing effective water conservation projects in the future. ii. Water Quality The project addresses water quality Improvement by monitoring temperature pH dissolved oxygen and other water quality parameters to identify where and how water quality improvements should be best directed. The monitoring project will benefit habitat protection and restoration by informing effective adaptive management for aquatic species habitat. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The project promotes resource stewardship by training and recruiting local volunteers as citizen monitors contributing to educating the local community about the importance of water conservation and watershed management in this Watershed. SGERC hopes to impact open space by helping facilitate monitoring of projects on open space land using community volunteers. The goal of streamflow monitoring is to inform effective water conservation and improve stream flows in San Gregorio Creek and its tributaries. Instream flow has been determined to be the most important limiting factor to salmonid populations and coho re-introduction in the San Gregorio Creek Watershed (San Gregorio Creek Watershed Management Plan 2010). Improving streamflows and addressing water quality issues are necessary to support current salmonids and an essential precursor to coho re-introduction.

The increased impervious surface associated with urban development also impacts watersheds' hydrographs causing erosion and sedimentation in waterways and water bodies. The potential exists however to retrofit streets with Low Impact Development features that introduce systems that mimic natural functions to remove pollutants and diminish impacts to hydrology which is a start in alleviate impacts to water resources. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If this project is not implemented stormwater runoff from streets will continue to be conveyed untreated to waterways and water bodies will continue to convey urban pollutants and will continue to be discharged at rates that are conducive to erosion and sedimentation. ","Project Benefits: Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) The Contra Costa County Green Street Retrofit Network Project will improve the water quality of stormwater runoff from Contra Costa County streets. Runoff from streets will be routed to bioretention facilities that remove pollutants and counteract hydrograph modification associated with the increased impervious surfaces present in the urban environment. Wherever possible treated runoff will be infiltrated. Related pedestrian and bicycle improvements will further reduce automobile-related pollutants from being introduce into stormwater. Monitoring of runoff from project sites before and after retrofits are implemented will help quantify the benefits of such projects which will be helpful in prioritizing future projects and determining how retrofitting existing streets with Low Impact Development features fits into the overall picture of improving the quality of urban runoff. Educational signage may cause incidental benefits by informing the public about stormwater pollution issues and what they can do to improve water quality. Flood and Stormwater Management Although specific project sites have not been selected for the Contra Costa County Green Street Retrofit Network Project if retrofits are implemented in areas that are prone to floowding (or upstream of areas that are prone to flooding) the Low Impact Development features will help to alleviate flooding.

"197 ","Petaluma Flood Impact Reduction Water & Habitat Quality Recreation Phase IV ","Petaluma Flood Impact Reduction Water & Habitat Quality Recreation Phase IV links seven individual project sites to achieve the maximum benefits of flood reduction habitat enhancement groundwater recharge and when feasible passive recreation while improving overall water quality and ecosystem function. Components of the projects include: design and construction of channel recontours flood terraces and where appropriate trails to reduce flood elevations and connect existing trail and passive recreational links; implementation of water quality improvement and groundwater recharge components; and habitat enhancement for numerous riparian corridor species. The project was developed to further efforts currently underway and connect related projects that support effective River and stream corridor management and enhancement for multiple benefits. ","('North Bay';) | Sonoma ","38.25 | -122.63 ","01/15/2014 ","10/31/2019 ","Project sites are located in the upper Petaluma River Watershed and extend from just north of the town of Penngrove along Lichau Creek down through the confluence with Capri Creek and include reaches on Lichau Willowbrook and Capri creeks as well as portions of the upper reach of the Petaluma River. ","Project Type Description: Utilization of flood terraces adjacent to the riparian corridor provides opportunity for sediment and pollutants including trash to settle out of the flowing water to facilitate easy pick-up and disposal following the storm events. Bank repairs channel recontours and installation of a sediment capture feature to increase the stability of project reach channels and reduce sedimentation to the River and tributaries. Flood terraces reconnect the flow channel to the historic floodplain reducing depth of out-of-bank flows; and where possible allow the daylighting of culverted storm flows to a natural channel way. Augmentation of the river corridor floodplain to capture and transport additional surface flows. Slowing the storm flows allowing ponding and recharge through pervious soils within the flood terraces provides recharge benefits for shallow aquifers. As with groundwater benefits infiltration of water from ponding and terracing improvements reducing the volume and velocity of downstream runoff. Improvements undertaken within the riparian corridor include the removal of invasive non-native species replanting with native species bank stabilization and installation of in-stream habitat structures to improve habitat quality for Central Coast Steelhead red-legged frog western pond turtle and other special status and non-listed species within the Petaluma Watershed. Flood model analysis of flood terracing projects already completed have proven significant reduction of base flood elevations in the vicinity of the improvements can be achieved. A terrace as short as 1000 linear feet of river corridor can result in a reduction in excess of 1' of flood depth thereby eliminating shallow flooding of residential and business structures which frequently occurs even in lower intensity storm events. ","Detailed description: The concept for the project was created using integrated pieces from adopted policy documents (see response #2 of this section for specific references). Connecting flood reduction improvements to opportunities to enhance groundwater recharge is a natural assumption. Intertwining passive recreation and public education and stewardship was essential to meet the expectations of an active engaged citizenry and interest groups. Identifying seven specific project sites allows maximization of benefits in the areas of reduced flood depths elimination or significant reduction of structure inundation connectivity of trails to destinations passive recreation and public and corporate stewardship opportunities in direct proximity to businesses and residential areas and groundwater recharge in areas of direct benefit to agricultural and rural land uses within immediately adjacent groundwater basins.Proposed physical improvements consist of channel recontouring and/or flood terracing adjacent to the creek or river removal of non-native invasive plant species replanting with native species to improve habitat and maintain storm flows providing passive use trails where appropriate and implementing groundwater recharge and water quality improvements within the recontoured flood terraces. ","Project Need: The proposed suite of projects will help to address several important challenges facing the Petaluma Watershed which includes the need for flood hazard reduction improved groundwater recharge water quality improvements that support Total Maximum Daily Load requirements yet to be developed for multiple parameters and improving habitat for listed species including but not limited to the Central Coast Steelhead. The projects meet the core objectives identified in the Upper Petaluma River Watershed Flood Control Project Scoping Study currently underway by the Sonoma County Water Agency and their consultant RMC Water and Environment. These include identifying flood hazard reduction implementation projects with a geographic focus on the upper Petaluma River Watershed that could help alleviate flooding within the City as well as increasing the beneficial recharge of groundwater. As previously mentioned in regards to land use planning the projects address needs and objectives identified in numerous planning documents including the City of Petaluma General Plan 2025. In addition to flood hazard reduction including passive recreation and public education and stewardship is essential to meet the expectations of an active engaged citizenry and interest groups. Efforts currently underway by NOAA Fisheries are focused on recovery for the Central California Coast Steelhead an important listed species that utilizes proposed project reaches on the Petaluma River and both Willowbrook and Lichau creeks for migration and spawning habitat. Projects such as these that increase channel stability and overhead canopy access to the historic floodplain and reduction in the delivery of fine sediment to the channel are critical to the stabilization and enhancement of critical habitat. In addition riparian and upland habitat enhancement will provide a critical buffer for adjusting to the uncertainties of climate change while assisting in carbon sequestration. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Environmental and economic impacts from flooding will continue unabated. For example the New Year s 2005 flood caused an estimated $56 million in damages from just one event. Groundwater levels will continue to decline and opportunities to slow and sink flows will be missed. Summer stream flow will also continue to decrease in relation to the depleted groundwater table affecting summering steelhead. Impaired water quality parameters will continue to persist while local stakeholder groups wait for the TMDL process to move forward in Petaluma. Opportunities for implementing in-stream and riparian enhancements that benefit recovery of the local steelhead population will be missed. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) The proposal consists of seven defined projects linked by location and relationship within the upper Petaluma River Watershed as well as the ability to provide sequential benefit to neighborhoods and habitat as tributaries drain seasonal storms flows from the upper watershed into the urban zone. Water supply benefits will be achieved primarily through passive groundwater recharge as a result of channel recontouring construction of flood terraces recontouring of an existing detention pond to improve function during peak storm flows and creation of a new drainage swale along a heavily impacted reach of the River corridor. The locations and methods for improving localized groundwater recharge will be identified during the preliminary design stage which will include hydraulic and hydrologic analysis on a project by project basis. By providing opportunities for storm flow to access and fan out over the floodplain at more frequent storm intervals connecting with constructed bioswales and other potential design features projects will maximize passive infiltration to the groundwater basin in the upper watershed. Additional water supply benefits can be achieved through the proposed Stony Point detention pond which would potentially provide surface storage for seasonal agricultural use. ii. Water Quality Water quality benefits will be realized through the repair of eroding stream banks installation of livestock exclusionary fencing deposition of sediment and other pollutants in the reconnected floodplain capture of sediment by a proposed sediment removal basin and the additional channel stabilization and filtration capabilities of installed riparian and emergent wetland vegetation and in-stream habitat structures. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Flood and Stormwater Management is a primary objective of this proposed suite of projects although it also provides excellent opportunities to deliver water quality and habitat enhancements as well. Through channel recontouring and bank stabilization construction of flood terraces recontouring of an existing detention pond to improve function during peak storm flows and creation of a new drainage swale along a heavily impacted reach of the River corridor all implemented in concert these projects will result in substantial reductions to peak surface flow. Utilizing the City of Petaluma s XP-SWMM Model and project  specific hydraulic analysis these projects will be designed to deliver substantial reductions in the volume and velocity of out-of-bank flows throughout the upper watershed. The proposed Stony Point detention pond which would include land acquisition and subsequent removal of permitted and unpermitted fill placed over the last three decades would greatly increase and improve surface water capacity and reduction of volume and velocity to downstream areas currently subject to severe flooding. This location affords an opportunity to link all the identified project types into a single project with an additional benefit of potential ponding for seasonal agricultural use. The Corona Reach parallel channel project located immediately downstream of the Denman Reach would create a linear detention channel to contain shallow surface flood waters currently ponding and flooding residential and business properties. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The proposed multi-benefit projects also include habitat protection and restoration as well as the creation of recreation education and stewardship opportunities along the River and tributaries where feasible. The proposed Denman Reach trail links will provide the last two minor links to connect Denman Reach Trailhead Phases 1 and 2 to Denman Reach Phase 3 currently underway with 100% funding and two major traffic/bicycle corridors (Corona Road and Stony Point Road). The links 740  and 825  in length will complete a section over 4200  in length with amenities such as flood terraces benches educational kiosks and a trailhead parking lot. Completion of the flood terracing and trail improvements will result in significant reduction of flood impacts within this river reach provide safe trails between two major roadway corridors widen the extent of the riparian corridor through restoration plantings and associated habitat improvements and provide a cohesive section of improvements for coordination of a neighborhood stewardship program between residents and business owners/operators. The Capri Creek recontour will provide for stewardship through education and outreach into neighboring residential areas including low-income neighborhoods presently adversely affected by flooding from this creek on a site also hosting a newly installed community garden. The Lichau Creek implementation project will install projects identified through a currently funded feasibility study intended to vet effective stream corridor management strategies for multiple benefits that include in addition to reducing peak flows and sedimentation to the waterway the enhancement of spawning and rearing habitat for Steelhead. Several projects will also provide fencing to limit access to the waterway by grazing livestock. ","  "," ","City of Petaluma

"198 ","Bay Area Water Supply and Conservation Agency (BAWSCA) Brackish Groundwater Desalination Project (Brackish Groundwater Project) ","The Brackish Groundwater Project is a critical for the implementation of brackish groundwater desalination in San Mateo County. California Water Service Company (CWS) has committed to partner with BAWSCA and the City of San Mateo to provide a desalination plant of the bay side of the Peninsula to benefit customers not only in the immediate area but also other BAWSCA member agencies. The brackish groundwater would be treated through membrane technologies to potable water standards for use by the BAWSCA member agencies. The Brackish Well Desalination Project will refine project yields from brackish groundwater aquifers by determining the hydraulic connection between the shallow aquifer and San Francisco Bay and will further refine anticipated costs for completing a brackish desalination plant. The Brackish Groundwater Project could ultimately provide up to 6.5 million gallons per day (mgd) of supply and will diversify the water supply portfolio of the region to increase reliability increase use of local water supply sources reduce dependence on imported surface water supplies and provide a potable water supply for emergency supply in the event of an earthquake or other major catastrophe.

","End of 2017 ","Brackish groundwater aquifer on the San Mateo Peninsula near the San Mateo Bridge ","Project Type Description: The Brackish Groundwater Project is the first phase of development of brackish groundwater aquifers in San Mateo County and will confirm (1) the yield quality and reliability of the brackish groundwater basin and and (2) creates a new active well that taps new brackish groundwater supplies which is a critical step towards implementation of a brackish desalination plant to provide a potable water supply to the 26 BAWSCA member agencies (three of which are CWS agencies) including Disadvantaged Communities (located in Redwood City East Palo Alto Palo Alto and Hayward) during drought years. ","Detailed description: BAWSCA has identified future supply shortfalls in drought years for the BAWSCA member agencies of up to 20% (43 mgd) in 2040 due to reductions on the SF RWS. BAWSCA s partner California Water Services Company (CWS) will need up to 10.7 mgd of new supply by 2040 given a 20% shortage on the SF RWS. Additionally CWS has a need to develop additional local supplies due to the limitations imposed on private retailers by the Raker Act. This information has been developed as part of BAWSCA s Long-Term Reliable Water Supply Strategy (Strategy) which is described below under the  Parent Project  header. One of the groups of possible water supply projects that has been identified and evaluated as part of the Strategy is the development of brackish groundwater supply that would be treated through membrane technologies to potable water standards for use by the BAWSCA member agencies. As a part of the Strategy BAWSCA developed the Strategy Groundwater Model (SGM) to estimate yield from and local and regional drawdown due to brackish desalination projects. In September 2012 the BAWSCA Board authorized funding the work to complete the SGM and evaluation of brackish groundwater desalination options. The model was be developed and calibrated in early 2013 and the Brackish Groundwater Desalination Feasibility Assessment   BAWSCA s Strategy Groundwater Model Development technical memorandum was published. Further study in 2014 provided an estimate of the potential yield of the brackish aquifers when limiting potential impacts to other groundwater pumpers in the region. Results of the SGM analysis were presented in Appendix A of the Long-Term Reliable Water Supply Strategy Phase II Final Report (Strategy Report) published in February 2015. Based on the SGM analysis BAWSCA estimates that up to 6.5 mgd of potable water could be recovered through brackish desalination if horizontal directionally drilled (HDD or slant) wells are used versus the typical shallow vertical wells to capture the brackish groundwater source. In addition initial estimates of source water quality as well as capital operations and maintenance costs have been developed for brackish groundwater desalination for different potential project yields. Analysis using the SGM indicated that yield could be maximized by using a series of horizontal wells located beneath the Bay and distributed across a fair length of Bay shoreline. In addition the source water would be a brackish aquifer instead of inland freshwater aquifers so pumping would have less of an impact on inland groundwater levels and the wells would recharge from the Bay. Slant wells and/or HDD wells use relatively new pipe drilling methods to drill at an angle beneath the Bay floor. Well shafts screens and a gravel pack slurry are inserted into the pipe to create the well prior to the pipe being removed. The slant well approach was recently piloted for a proposed facility in Orange County California and the horizontal approach is being considered for proposed facilities in Monterey and San Diego counties. As the first phase of the development BAWSCA and CWS (Project Partners) will define the potential range of hydraulic capacity of wells installed in the brackish aquifer identify source water quality further refine costs and identify potential impacts to other groundwater pumpers in the region via the Brackish Groundwater Project described here. The Brackish Groundwater Project is a shallow aquifer exploration program to refine project yields and evaluate the hydraulic connection between the shallow aquifer and San Francisco Bay in San Mateo County and would consist of the following steps: 1. Approach: After site selection implement a step-wise systematic well-drilling and data collection program with the following tasks: 1) drill test boring for extraction well; 2) install and test dual-purpose monitoring- and extraction-well; and 3) install supplementary monitoring wells (one shallow and one deep) and conduct long-term controlled aquifer test. At each point the data is evaluated to the suitability of the chosen location. If determined the data indicates the site is suitable the effort continues to the next step whereas if determined unsuitable the investigation is modified as appropriate. 2. Key objectives: Measure site-specific well yield and hydraulic connection between the shallow aquifer and bay. 3. Duration: Of sufficient length to appropriately measure and evaluate the hydraulic interaction between the shallow aquifer and bay. This may require one month or more of pumping to induce a sufficient response and acquire adequate data to estimate the effective hydraulic conductivity of the Bay Mud. 4. Chemical analyses: Determine potential changes in groundwater quality and estimate changes in the proportional contribution of bay water to the well yield. Drill Test Boring and Install Monitoring and Extraction Wells The geologic samples and geophysical survey from the test boring will confirm or refute the expected aquifer characteristics beneath the site (the cumulative thickness of fine-grained clay and coarse-grained sand and gravel). Groundwater that is hydraulically connected to the bay is also affected by tides and the magnitude of the tidal influence measured in the well is determined by the water transmitting and storage properties of the shallow aquifer. Water level changes in the well can be measured and analyzed to determine the water transmitting and storage properties of the aquifer. Continuous water level data collected in the well over a three-month period will be analyzed to determine the water storage and transmitting properties of the aquifer. The well can then be used to conduct a short-term pumping test (24 hours or less) to verify these results and determine actual well yield. The pumping test results will then be used to design a longer-term test (1 to 1.5 months) necessary to confirm yields and quantify the hydraulic condition between the aquifer and bay. Additional monitoring wells will be needed to prepare for this long-term test. Install Shallow and Deep Monitoring Wells and Conduct Aquifer Test Monitoring wells should be installed on-site to measure drawdown in both the shallow (100 feet or less) and deep aquifers (200 feet deep). Uncertainty in aquifer conditions specifically the degree of shallow aquifer confinement and the hydraulic conductivity of the bay mud produce a fairly large range in the possible groundwater level response to extractions from the shallow aquifer. This range in responses influences the volumes of water extracted and the required pump test duration. The SGM was used to estimate potential pumping rates pumping duration and monitoring well locations that are required for conceptual pumping tests located in the area of interest. The estimated pumping rate is 0.2 million gallons per day (about 140 gpm) and the simulated drawdowns range from about 30 feet in the pumping well to 2.5 feet in the shallow observation well; the pumping duration required to evaluate the bay-aquifer hydraulic connection could range from about one week to more than one month. For planning purposes we assumed the pumping test would be conducted for 45 days or less. Characterize Groundwater Quality and Mixing of Between Groundwater and Baywater After well installation and development samples of the pumped well water will be collected and analyzed to characterize the quality of water produced by the well and identify potential bay water indicators (for example chloride boron and stable isotopes of oxygen and deuterium). During the extended pumping test samples of the extracted water shall also be periodically collected and analyzed to determine relative changes over time in the proportional mixture of shallow groundwater and baywater produced by the well. Observed changes in water quality and the water level data can be used to quantify the hydraulic conductivity of the bay mud. Parent Project BAWSCA represents the 26 agencies in the Bay Area that purchase water on a wholesale basis from the San Francisco Regional Water System (SF RWS). The BAWSCA service area encompasses three counties (i.e. in San Mateo Santa Clara and Alameda Counties) and three of the four BAIRWMP subregions (i.e. West South and East). The BAWSCA member agencies currently serve over 1.7 million people in San Mateo Santa Clara and Alameda Counties. This service population is estimated to increase to over 2.1 million people by 2040. In February 2015 BAWSCA published the Long-Term Reliable Water Supply Strategy Phase II Final Report (Strategy Report). The Strategy Report represents a nearly five year effort by BAWSCA and its member agencies to identify appropriate water management actions that provide long-term water supply reliability for the region. For the Strategy Report BAWSCA performed a comprehensive assessment of the regional water supply reliability needs through the year 2040 evaluated potential water supply reliability projects that could be implemented to meet these needs and identified a suite of actions to achieve increased regional reliability. Successful implementation of the Strategy is essential to ensuring that BAWSCA will meet its water management objective   that a reliable high quality supply of water is available where and when people businesses and community agencies within the BAWSCA service area need it. The Strategy Report identified significant drought-year demands when cutbacks to the BAWSCA agencies from the SF RWS are projected to be as much as 43 mgd by 2040. Successful implementation of the Strategy is critical to ensuring that there will be sufficient and reliable water supplies for the BAWSCA member agencies and their customers in drought periods. Both individual agency-led and BAWSCA-led regional projects were evaluated as part of the Strategy including recycled water projects local capture and reuse projects desalination (brackish groundwater San Francisco Bay water) projects conservation and water transfer projects. After conducting an exhaustive evaluation of more than 65 possible projects BAWSCA identified only two types of projects that together could produce up to 80% of the 2040 drought-year reliability need: desalination and water transfers. The Strategy Report identified two types of projects 1) a project that produces 15 mgd of water sourced from an open intake in San Francisco Bay; and 2) a project that produces up to 6.5 mgd from brackish water sourced from either shallow vertical brackish groundwater wells or horizontal directionally drilled (HDD) wells extracting higher salinity brackish groundwater from under the Bay. Cost estimates were developed for a range of 0.7 mgd to 6.5 mgd for a brackish desalination project. Analysis done for the Strategy Report shows that brackish water desalination projects compare favorably with open intake desalination projects based on increased regulatory hurdles costs and issues with land availability and brine disposal associated with the latter.

During drought years the BAWSCA member agencies receive average cutbacks of up to 26% on their SF RWS deliveries depending on the severity and duration of the drought events. Cutbacks of this magnitude are expected to occur on average once every 11 years and to create a supply shortfall in the BAWSCA service area of up to 43 mgd by 2040. Because of how water from the SF RWS is allocated between the BAWSCA member agencies some agencies are required to absorb cutbacks to their SF RWS supplies that are as high as 40%. BAWSCA s partner CWS will need up to 10.71 mgd of new supply by 2040 given a 20% shortage on the SF RWS. The frequency and magnitude of these cutbacks will have a significant impact on the residential commercial and industrial customers in the BAWSCA service areas (e.g. it has been estimated that the regional economic impacts of such cutbacks could be up to $2 Billion in each year of a drought in 2010 dollars see http://www.donpedro-relicensing.com/Lists/Meetings/Attachments/79/CCSF%20Draft%20Socioeconomic%20Study_3_13_2014.pdf). In order mitigate at least a portion of the drought year impacts to the BAWSCA service area the Strategy evaluated the benefits of developing recycled water projects local capture and reuse projects desalination (brackish groundwater seawater San Francisco Bay water) projects and water transfer projects. After conducting an exhaustive evaluation of more than 65 possible projects BAWSCA identified only two types of projects that together could produce up to 80% of the 2040 drought-year reliability need: desalination and water transfers. The other potential regional projects provide tangible though limited benefit in reducing dry year shortfalls given the small average yields in drought years. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The Brackish Groundwater Project is critical to development of brackish groundwater aquifers to provide a new normal and drought year supply to the BAWSCA agencies diversify the water supply portfolio of the region to increase reliability increase use of local water supply sources reduce dependence on imported surface water supplies and provide a potable water supply for emergency supply in the event of an earthquake or other major catastrophe. Taking no action on this project would leave a valuable local resource untapped. In absence of additional drought reliability the BAWSCA member agencies and their customers will be faced with economic and other impacts up to $2 Billion dollars per year (in 2010 dollars see http://www.donpedro-relicensing.com/Lists/Meetings/Attachments/79/CCSF%20Draft%20Socioeconomic%20Study_3_13_2014.pdf) in each year of a drought. Further if the water supplies that are available to the BAWSCA member agencies are unreliable and subject to drought shortages existing and future customers will be increasingly affected. In a broad sense without sufficient additional water supplies to meet projected demands residential and economic development could be curtailed within the BAWSCA service area and potentially relocated to other parts of the State or elsewhere. This could result in loss of new housing jobs manufacturing and community services. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) Regional Project Benefit The Brackish Groundwater Project could ultimately provide up to 6.5 million gallons per day (mgd) of supply and will diversify the water supply portfolio of the region to increase reliability increase use of local water supply sources reduce dependence on imported surface water supplies and provide a potable water supply for emergency supply in the event of an earthquake or other major catastrophe. The BAWSCA Strategy provides a regional framework for the evaluation and development of supply projects to mitigate the economic and other impacts of future supply shortfalls during drought years. Rather than looking at just a single project for a single agency the Strategy allows evaluation comparison and implementation of a variety of projects that could create additional drought year supply for BAWSCA service area. Because they are potentially larger scale and more regional in nature some projects that were evaluated as part of the Strategy include the utilization of the existing SF RWS to convey the water to where it is needed. The implementation of the Strategy will provide benefits to both the individual agencies that might not otherwise be able to develop their own projects in as cost-effective a manner as well as to all of the BAWSCA member agencies by increasing the water supply reliability in the BAWSCA service area. The Strategy and its associated projects address multiple BAIRWMP goals including:   integrating of multiple resource management strategies;   providing direct benefit to three of the BAIRWMP subregions three of the Bay Area counties and multiple partners;   providing solutions that are technically feasible;   benefiting disadvantaged communities; and   providing for climate change adaptation.

","Detailed description: This project aims to restore seasonal and tidal wetland habitat by reconnecting tidal fluvial and upland components and by reinitiating related physical and ecological processes within Spring Branch Creek. A primary purpose of the project is to remove barriers to estuarine transgression in order to allow habitats to transgress up the Spring Branch Creek gradient as sea level rises. Tidal Marsh Restoration Features (Figure 3.2) Physical Modifications & Biological Enhancements Berm Removal & Service Road Closure. Remove levee and culverts at distal end of lower Spring Branch Creek (at current South Pasture Trail crossing) and revegetate area with native species. Removal of this levee will require permanent closure of the service road from the preserve headquarters to the South Pasture.Actively revegetate berm removal areaDitch Filling and Channel creation. Eliminate L-shaped berm fill accompanying borrow ditch and grade a new set of unstable distributary channels in lower Spring Branch Creek. Listed Species Recruitment. Evaluate potential for additional propagation and active recruitment of soft bird's beak.Revegetation and weed control in adaptive restoration context Invasive Plant Control. Monitor excavation sites to detect colonization by invasive weeds and respond rapidly with appropriate targeted weed control measures. Channel Modification o Remove the berm and culvert choking tidal flows storm surges and the transport of coarse organic debris in upper Spring Branch Creek; revegetate all graded areas. o Pull back incised creek banks into gentler side slopes o Replace the undersized Grizzly Island Road culvert with a bridge or a set of oversized culverts to allow unimpeded peak flows (including debris) and channel switching (avulsion events) to move from Upper to Lower Spring Branch Creek.   Seasonal Pools. Excavate shallow (less than approximately 2.5-3.0 ft maximum depth) seasonal wetland pools in backwater slough areas to create native amphibian breeding habitats and tri colored blackbird habitat that are relatively more isolated from populations of small predatory fish that are washed out of impoundments above the SLT property (see basis for design below). Vegetation enhancement and management:   Restore sedge-rush seasonal wet meadow and grassland sods in alluvium: o Limit the duration of livestock grazing in seasonal wetlands to brief grazing periods when soils are firm or graze with sheep instead of cattle to reduce trampling disturbance of saturated soils and the rhizomes of native clonal perennial graminoids.   Reintroduce clonal perennial dominants of sedge-rush-spikerush meadow in thick loamy alluvium.   Reintroduce brackish/alkali-tolerant native annuals (and Parish s pickleweed) via heavy seeding in alkali flats (harsh/unproductive eroded sandstone-derived soils which provide potential habitat for alkali wet grassland/forbs). Include uncommon/declining/rare plants (e.g. small-fruited peppercress native tarweed goldfields species). Visitor Education & Public Access Trail Realignment. Re-align South Pasture Trail and construct a boardwalk across Spring Branch Creek upstream from Berm Removal/Service Road Closure site. Eliminate upstream trail crossing resulting in access across lower Spring Branch Creek at one location instead of two. Interpretive Station Installation. Construct an interpretive station on a spur trail from the new South Pasture Trail to provide visitor viewing access to a population of endangered soft bird s beak and to provide passive controls to prevent use impacts. Agricultural Use & Emergency Vehicle Access Alternate Service Road. Establish an alternate service road originating from Grizzly Island Road south of where it crosses Spring Branch Creek to provide access for land stewardship grazing operations and public safety vehicles. Service road will consist of hard packed native clay soil similar to the existing service road.Livestock Crossing. Install gates and set up temporary fencing along shoulder of Grizzly Island Road providing livestock access across seasonal wetland to facilitate pasture rotations.Irrigation Pipe. Install and maintain a pipe across lower Spring Branch Creek to provide livestock water to the South Pasture and/or repair existing stock pond and well. ","Project Need: The intact gradual transition zone between tidal slough marsh and uplands at Rush Ranch is one of the most unique and ecologically important features of the preserve. Whereas tidal marshes are threatened with complete inundation throughout much of the SF Bay Estuary the connectivity between marsh and terrestrial habitat at Rush Ranch provides the possibility for estuarine transgression whereby marsh and transitional habitat can migrate upslope in response to sea level rise. Current estimates for the rate of sea level rise in the SF Bay estuary are predicted to be in the range of 26-55 inches by 2100 resulting in increasing water depth and in higher salinity. Climate change is also predicted to bring higher average temperatures and an increase in the severity of storms. In addition to sea level rise Rush Ranch will be impacted by salinity intrusion as sea level rises throughout the Bay Area. Salinity intrusions will likely result in changes in the composition and structure of the plant community with cascading effects in throughout the food chain. While the ecological changes brought about by sea level rise and climate change are difficult to predict the gradual transition zone at Rush Ranch presents one of the best opportunities for inward migration of marsh habitat and also provides an excellent opportunity to monitor the effects of sea level rise and salinity intrusion as it occurs. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the project does not occur the site will continue to function at a low ecological level with limited benefits to endangered species.

At present barriers block access to approximately 25 miles of high quality steelhead trout spawning and rearing habitat during moderate or low flows. Additionally when appropriate barrier removal will incorporate the addition of habitat improvement features into the project site and stabilize stream banks to protect from failure. ","Detailed description: This project will result in final project design and subsequent removal of the seven high priority fish passage barriers in the Napa River watershed (Napa River Fish Barrier Plan 2011). Barrier modification will improve fish passage to over 24 miles of high quality steelhead trout spawning and rearing habitat in the watershed. Six of the barriers are imposed by road crossings over tributaries (Mill Ritchey Kimball and Campbell Creeks) to the Napa River. Improving fish crossings at these barriers will require replacement or modification of existing road crossings. One barrier is a footpath that crosses the Napa River (Napa River Fish Barrier Plan 2011). Conceptual plans for modifying all of the barriers have been developed. For four of the barriers (Dry Kimball Campbell Creeks and Napa River) funding is needed for both construction design development and implementation. For the remaining three barriers (two on Ritchey Creek and one on Mill Creek) funding is needed for permitting and implementation only. Designs will be developed by an engineer and design firm with input from the Napa County Resource Conservation District (RCD) and landowners (the City of Calistoga CA State Parks Napa County). The firm will conduct a topographic survey of the barrier sites then conduct geomorphic assessments hydraulic modeling and geotechnical analyses to inform their design plans. The final design documents may then be used as a basis for contractor bidding and contracting. The design plans will include a title sheet (general notes location); demolition staging and access plan; project layout; profiles and cross-sections; channel restoration and bank stabilization details; structural details for thebridge; revegetation and erosion control plans and details. Specifications will outline and describe tolerances and materials detailed in the project plans. Upon completion of the 100% design and with coordination between design firm RCD and the City of Calistoga the RCD or the City should have all materials necessary to obtain permits and hire contractors for implementation. ","Project Need: The Napa River watershed encompasses an area of approximately 426 square miles at the northern end of San Pablo Bay in the San Francisco Estuary. The Napa River and its tributaries support a diverse community of native fishes including two salmonid species: steelhead and Chinook salmon. Steelhead spawning and rearing occurs primarily in the smaller high-gradient tributary streams throughout the watershed while Chinook spawning and rearing occurs primarily in the mainstem Napa River and low-gradient reaches of some large tributary streams. Both species are anadromous meaning they need an uninterrupted corridor from their freshwater spawning and rearing habitat to the ocean. Artificial migration barriers constructed during the past century have contributed to population declines of salmonids in the Napa River watershed by limiting access to potential habitat (Stillwater Sciences 2002). These obstructions range from small temporal barriers which can delay upstream migration depending on flow conditions to large-scale municipal dams (e.g. Conn dam Rector dam etc.) which completely cut off access to otherwise suitable habitat. Steelhead return to the Napa River to spawn in the winter typically from January to March; although in years with abundant late-season rainfall adult fish have been observed spawning as late as May. Steelhead spawning is difficult to document because adult fish migrate primarily at night and spawn during winter storm flows when water clarity is low. Therefore not much is known about the specific movement patterns of adult steelhead in the Napa River watershed. In order to maximize access to high-gradient and often intermittent streams adult fish typically migrate upstream on the receding limbs of winter storm flows. In years with below average runoff access to small tributary streams which this species prefers can be limited. Steelhead spawning in the mainstem Napa River has been recently documented although it appears to be most prevalent in dry years when access to prime tributary spawning habitat is limited by low streamflow (Koehler and Blank 2010). Juvenile steelhead rear in freshwater for one or more years before smolting (outmigrating) to the ocean. Juvenile fish typically remain in cool shady streams with perennial flow for up to three years before smolting at 125 to 200 mm in length (Koehler and Blank 2011). During their freshwater rearing and growth phase juvenile steelhead feed mostly on aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates and may move around within a stream and between streams at higher flows. Therefore unimpeded migration and dispersal routes are an important component of steelhead rearing habitat. The Napa River Fish Barrier Plan (2011) assessed hydraulic impacts and upstream fish habitat quality for the 21 highest priority fish passage barriers in the watershed (118 barriers have been identified high priority barriers are severe or impede access to high quality habitat). The plan identifies the seven barriers in this proposal as the barriers that should receive the highest priority for mitigation because they impedes access to 24 miles of high quality steelhead spawning and rearing habitat. The seven named tributaries feeding into the Napa River above the foot path barrier Mill Creek Campbell Creek Dry Creek and Kimball Cree offer abundant and relatively high quality spawning and rearing habitat for steelhead trout and Chinook salmon. The tributaries also support steelhead spawning to differing degrees. In contrast Chinook are not believed to utilize these smaller streams regularly. In addition to steelhead and Chinook the Napa River also supports an assemblage of 13 other native fish species including two that are migratory: Pacific lamprey and River lamprey. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If this proposal is not implemented the existing fish passage barriers will continue to impedes fish access to 24 miles of high quality steelhead spawning and rearing habitat in the Napa River watershed.

The program's long-term baseline data allows resource protection specialists to identify abnormalities in species abundance and distribution such as a die-off. During an environmental disaster like an oil spill Beach Watch's historic data alerts Incident Command about endangered or threatened species that normally occur on specific beaches in the area; thus helping to focus clean-up and protection resources to where they are most needed.

Beach Watch's long-term dataset dating back to 1993 provides resource protection specialists with information to determine how each beach segment has changed over time. Not only do the data demonstrate change in species abundance and distribution that could be linked to climate change but they also illustrate shifts in erosion patterns and surface runoff. In addition during extreme environmental events such as the 2007 Cosco Busan oil spill Beach Watch s historical data informs Incident Command about species most likely to be affected on each beach during a particular season. Beach Watch volunteers are also often the first to discover injured wildlife and newly oiled beaches. As a result Beach Watch s daily reports to Incident Command during oil spills inform the response effort accordingly. As a testament to the importance and rigor of the Beach Watch program s data the program was awarded a three-year grant from California Sea Grant to create baseline data for the new marine protected areas (MPAs) on California s north central coast. The Beach Watch program was selected among numerous worthwhile projects to be a key player in the MPA evaluation process. In addition our partners such as the US Coast Guard the California Department of Fish and Game s Office of Spill Prevention and Response (OSPR) the Point Reyes National Seashore the California Academy of Sciences the Golden Gate National Recreational Area and the Marine Mammal Center depend heavily on Beach Watch data.

The 1984 Puerto Rican spill that dumped 1.47 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (the largest spill ever in the San Francisco Bay Area) along with the unprecedented spill in Valdez Alaska in 1989 led to one of the most thorough examinations of the effects of oil on the environment. What was missing however was baseline data that would help determine what the area would look like if the disasters had not occurred. Beach Watch provides exactly that for the California coastline. Since the program began there has been a growing interest in tracking the impacts of climate change worldwide. As a result the Beach Watch program has become a valuable source of data to demonstrate long-term changes in the coastal environment. Many climate change programs just gaining traction today do not have the baseline of historic data that Beach Watch is able to provide. As a result the Beach Watch program fills an important niche in documenting the status of the program's 41 beach segments over time through data collection surveys and through beach profile photographs. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the Beach Watch program did not exist there would be no long-term record of what is \"normal\" for each of the program's 41 beach segments along the coast of the Bay Area. Decision-making by resource managers would be less informed and valuable habitat and species would suffer as a result. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality ... iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The Beach Watch program's benefits will most visibly be seen in terms of habitat protection and restoration. These benefits can be measured by documenting the number of a particular endangered or threatened species spotted during surveys over time. In addition the program collects data on tarballs encountered during surveys. Finally human activity is recorded during surveys using categories such as \"fishing\" \"dog walking\" and \"boating.\" With these data the Beach Watch program can quantify the change in human activity on a beach over time and this can be used to determine the benefits to habitat protection by the program. As mentioned above the Beach Watch program also provides essential data on the health of beaches before during and after an environmental disaster such as an oil spill. This information is used by SCAT teams and is also valuable in allocating clean-up resources to where they are most needed--a beach with nesting snowy plovers for instance. With beach surveys consistently continuing even after the disaster the Beach Watch program plays a vital role in documenting the restoration and recovery of each beach segment.

The project is located at 951 Turner Court in central Hayward Alameda County California just west of the Highway 880/Highway 92 interchange 2.5 miles east of the bay coastline. The City of Hayward is 25 miles southeast of San Francisco 14 miles south of Oakland 26 miles north of San Jose and 10 miles west of the valley communities surrounding Pleasanton. ","Project Type Description: The proposed Low Impact Development measures will address water quality problems typical of runoff from parking lots and roofs. Problem constituents include: suspended solids (coarse sand to finer silts and clays) gasoline and motor oil from the impervious surfaces as well as fertilizers and pesticides (nitrates and phosphates) from the landscaped areas. Other pollutants include: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) heavy metals nickel copper zinc cadmium and lead hydrocarbons from atmospheric deposition and trash (such as paper plastic polystyrene packing foam and aluminum materials) and biodegradable organic debris (such as leaves grass cuttings and food waste) that can be entrained in urban runoff. ","Detailed description: The proposed project seeks to implement Low Impact Development (LID) measures within a design to retrofit two existing parking lots that service Alameda County Public Works Agency (ACPWA) buildings 951 and 951A Turner Court in Hayward Alameda County California. The proposed project seeks to treat all of the flow draining both parking lots. The following LID site design and biotreatment measures will be implemented at the project site: pervious asphalt porous concrete and permeable pavers bioretention (rain gardens biofiltration and green gutters) flow-through and stormwater planters interceptor trees and rain barrels. The proposed project will serve as a site for education and outreach of LID concepts for Alameda County contractors and Clean Water Program stormwater managers. Built in the 1950s the existing parking lots currently provide no stormwater runoff water quality treatment. At 951 Turner Court the existing site drainage area (120000 sq. ft) consists of impervious asphalt paving roof runoff and small landscaped areas. All flow is routed below building 951 to the City of Hayward storm drain system. At the smaller 951A Turner Court building the site drainage area (22000 sq. ft.) flows south to a storm drain inlet that directly connects to the City storm drain. Both project sites ultimately drain into the Old Alameda Creek Flood Control Channel. At 951 Turner Court impervious areas will be reduced from 85% to 35% of the drainage area; at 951A impervious areas will be reduced from 50% to 40%. The design intent is to treat all stormwater runoff that drains to the receiving outlets at each site. The design approach follows the LID Feasibility Evaluation Process (Bay Area Stormwater Management Agencies Association 2011). Implementation of Low Impact Development measures throughout the project site and minimizing impervious surface areas while providing adequate drainage and parking facilities should pose no risks to water quality. ","Project Need: Project LID components can help reduce pollutant loading to the Old Alameda Creek watershed by reducing sedimentation petroleum hydrocarbons metals nutrients trash and debris input into the waterways. As per the San Francisco Bay RWQCB Resolution No. R2-2010-0100 the Basin Plan was amended to include additional surface water bodies. This Basin Plan amendment was adopted by the Water Board on July 14 2010. The State Water Board approved this amendment on December 5 2011. One of the new surface water bodies added to the Basin Plan was Old Alameda Creek (South Bay Basin) (the project watershed) and its beneficial uses were listed as: Estuarine Habitat Wildlife Habitat Water Contact Recreation Non-Water Contact Recreation. Possible pollutants from parking lot impervious surface runoff can impact the beneficial uses in the following ways: Excessive erosion transport and deposition of sediment in surface waters are a significant form of pollution resulting in water quality impairments. Excessive sediment can impair aquatic life by reducing beneficial habitat structure in stream channels affecting benthic fauna by filling interstitial spaces of spawning gravels impairing fish food sources and filling rearing pools. Petroleum hydrocarbons such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms from contaminated water sediments and food and are toxic to aquatic life at low concentrations. Hydrocarbons can persist in sediments for long periods of time and result in adverse impacts on the diversity and abundance of benthic communities. Trace Metals are of concern because of the potential for toxic effects on aquatic life and the potential for ground water contamination resulting from surface water infiltration to underlying aquifer systems. High metal concentrations can lead to bioaccumulation in fish and shellfish and affect beneficial uses of receiving waters. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Untreated stormwater runoff from roofs and parking lots will continue to flow directly into the piped storm drain system. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) LID components will yield greater infiltration for local groundwater recharge. ii. Water Quality LID components will provide water quality treatment for stormwater runoff. This will result in pollutant load reductions including Total Suspended Sediments (TSS) nutrients and metals. Following the ACCWP C.3. Technical Guidance Manual procedures major LID components have been sized to ensure adequate volume and duration for treated impervious areas flowing to each component. This preliminary hydraulic sizing of the stormwater treatment measures uses the Municipal Regional Stormwater permit s flow-based sizing criteria. This sizing procedure requires use of parameters such as drainage area impervious area composite runoff coefficient required capture volume and drawdown time for the treatment measure in order to calculate a) treatment area without any storage (maximum required area of biotreatment) and b) treatment area if maximum storage of 12 inches is allowed (minimum required area of biotreatment with 1-ft storage). Preliminary calculations show that the areas available for proposed bioretention have more than sufficient area for treatment of all tributary impervious areas. In this project pervious pavement and porous concrete reduce total impervious surface areas by nearly 50%. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Raingardens detention basins and bioswales will promote greater infiltration rates creating decreased runoff to storm drains. According to the ACCWP C.3 Technical Guidance Manual (2011) hydromodification management over the project must be designed such that any increase in surface runoff must be retained on-site with gradual discharge either to groundwater through infiltration losses by evapotranspiration and/or discharge to the downstream watercourse at a level below the critical flow that causes creek channel erosion. The method of Flow Duration Control is specified for design of hydromodification components which manages runoff discharge over the full range of runoff flow levels predicted through continuous hydrologic simulation modeling based on a long-term precipitation record. The Bay Area Hydrology Model (BAHM) was applied to predict pre- and post-development flows. BAHM includes continuous simulation modeling or pre- and post-project runoff from the site using actual long-term rainfall records scaled for the project location. In this project the amount of impervious area is actually reduced--from 84% to 35% at Building 951 and from 50% to 40% at 951A. Existing land-use conditions (impervious and pervious) were run against proposed land-use conditions over the site and the results show that the various LID features and increased pervious surfaces produce a mitigated condition where post-project runoff was less than pre-project flow rates.

","Detailed description: The Project proposes to evaluate and manage hazardous trees for public safety consistent with flood control objectives including stream-bank protection; protecting and restoring native riparian tree cover; and enhancing wildlife habitat along San Leandro Creek between the railroad crossing and the I-580 Freeway. The project will assess and rate the failure potential of the large trees in the corridor. Trees rated high will be removed. Many of the trees along the creek are non-native eucalyptus--with some specimens nearly one-hundred feet tall with extremely large diameters located on steep unstable banks. The project will also evaluate the stability of the creek banks and potential risk of failure resulting from tree failure to cause flooding erosion and sediment discharge into San Francisco Bay. Fallen trees/limbs have the potential of diverting flows into the creek banks resulting in bank failure and potential loss of properties. The project will also assess and implement improvement of the riparian corridor by removing or managing non-native species and planting native trees to improve riparian habitat richness.

","This project will take 18 to 24 months to complete. ","The Project addresses fish passage barriers at two sites both located within Memorial County Park San Mateo County on Pescadero Creek in the Pescadero-Butano Creek Watershed. Memorial County Park is located at 9500 Pescadero Creek Road Loma Mar 94021. The Sequoia Flats Crossing and the seasonal dam upstream on the main stem of Pescadero Creek. Both sites are within San Mateo Memorial County Park in southern San Mateo County near the Town of Loma Mar. The first site is the Sequoia Flats Crossing located near the Sequoia Flats Family Camp on the northern side of Memorial County Park approximately 2860 feet upstream from the vehicle crossing near the Tan Oak Trail. The extent of this site is 200 feet. The second site is the seasonal dam is located near the amphitheater on the southern side of the park. The total extent of this site is approximately 100 feet and the extent of excavation is approximately 60 feet. Together the extent of work is 300 feet. The Park is located in southern San Mateo County about eight linear miles inland from the Pacific Ocean. ","Project Type Description: This project will restore access for salmonids to 62.3 miles of spawning and rearing habitat by modifying the two remaining fish passage barriers on Pescadero Creek. Additionally the immediate site conditions will be improved through the readjustment of the stream bed morphology when the instream structures are modified. ","Detailed description: The Project will modifying the two remaining fish passage barriers on Pescadero Creek to improve migratory conditions for coho salmon as well as benefit migratory conditions for steelhead trout.Restoration Elements Proposed at Sequoia Flats Crossing Site : The Sequoia Flats vehicle ford is the first of two fish passage barriers on Pescadero Creek to be addressed by the Project. Design objectives at this site are to facilitate fish passage (especially local fish passage during low flow conditions) lower the invert opening so that stored sediment upstream of the structure can be naturally transported downstream and a more biological beneficial and stable channel morphology can re-establish itself. Other objectives are to widen the low flow opening to the maximum extent possible thereby increasing the window of opportunity for fish passage through the crossing at low flows and prevent hydraulic impacts to flow in the channel. Finally the design reflects concerns to continue to allow park users safe summer-time access to the Sequoia Flat Family Campground. To implement the project the existing vehicle ford would be demolished and replaced by a permanent pre-cast 15-wide arched culvert.Restoration Elements Proposed at Dam Site: The dam was established in 1938 and previously included flashboards that enabled the area to be used for swimming for Park visitors. These flashboards were also thought to support County Parks  water intake upstream. In 2001 the flashboards were removed after serious discussion among County Parks and the fisheries agencies about how to address this barrier to fish passage at the site. The current designs include adding a broad v-notch that extends nearly the width of the sill will be removed. This option would modify the dam to create a v-notch approximately 37 feet wide with a maximum depth of 4.1 feet with a 2-foot wide by 0.5-foot wide deep low flow channel at the bottom. In addition the concrete wing walls would be removed down to the level of the rip-rap immediately downstream . The surface of the dam would be left fairly irregular with roughness features added once the notch is cut and an adverse slope created at the dam to form a small low-velocity area just upstream of the lip of the dam. ","Project Need: The Project remediates the two remaining fish passage barriers on the mainstem of Pescadero Creek that limit access to more than 60 miles of spawning and rearing habitat in the creek and its tributaries in the upper watershed. Both salmon and trout live out their freshwater life stages in San Mateo County including coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) but these species have experienced substantial population declines here. While steelhead are still found in numerous streams coho remain as spawning populations in only a few streams. Populations are federally listed as endangered or threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). The Central California Coast evolutionary significant unit (ESU) includes San Mateo County and was among one of the first in which both coho and steelhead were listed. Historically coho ran in Pescadero Creek [1] . While coho are not currently present in the watershed the Pescadero watershed is critical for the long-term viability of the species as it will undoubtedly benefit from the barrier remediation actions over the long term. It is the only independent watershed (from a coho recovery perspective) in San Mateo County. This means recovery of coho here is inextricably linked to successful recovery in this watershed. All actions supporting recovery including timely passage to spawning grounds and movement of juveniles is all that much more critical. And of course steelhead will enjoy immediate benefits when these barriers are addressed both in the short and long term The restoration and protection of Pescadero Creek and its watershed is a conservation priority for the State of California for reduction of sediment and addressing sediment transport within the watershed. The Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) has designated this watershed under the CWA Section 303(d) as impaired by excessive sedimentation due to erosion and sediment from natural geologic and climatic processes intensified by human land use practices including roads and timber clearcutting. Excess sediment has degraded aquatic habitat and led to declining populations of rare and endangered species including coho salmon steelhead trout tidewater goby California red-legged frog and San Francisco garter snake. RWQCB is in the process of establishing a Total Daily Maximum Load (TMDL) for sediment for the watershed [1]. The creek and its watershed is also a conservation priority for the State of California for recovery of salmonids. The DFG 2004 Recovery Strategy for California Coho Salmon includes priority tasks for implementation in the Pescadero Creek watershed including the work proposed for completion through this Project. The DFG 1996 Steelhead Restoration and Management Plan for California including the 2012 updated task list included priority tasks for implementation in the Pescadero Creek watershed also including work proposed to be completed through this Project. The creek and the watershed is also a conservation priority for the federal government as indicated in the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) 2010 Draft CCC Coho Salmon Recovery Plan: Appendix F-Pescadero Creek Watershed. The creek its watershed and work at the two sites are also high priorities as identified through the Integrated Watershed Restoration Program (IWRP) managed by the California State Coastal Conservancy (SCC). IWRP focuses on a voluntary non-regulatory approach to watershed restoration by providing funds for project designs and permits and establishing an interagency technical advisory committee (TAC). The TAC consists of representatives of various state and federal resource agencies who vet project plans and design and address permitting issues. IWRP for San Mateo County identified the two fish passage barriers in Memorial County Park as high priorities for remediation. DFG is a member (Jennifer Nelson and Krissy Atkinson) of the TAC and recommended the two sites be identified as priorities for remediation. DFG staff Elliott Dass and Marcin Whitman also asked the RCD to step forward as the applicant to see this Project completed. Work at the two sites were identified in the IWRP 2009 document List of IWRP TAC Priority Projects for San Mateo Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties compiled by Kellyx Nelson Jim Robins and Paul Robins. Finally in light of climate change models and the potential for water to become warmer summer flows to become reduced and the range of redwoods to shrink (conifer forest is directly correlated to coho habitat) this Project can support upstream movement of juveniles during the dry months. This is especially important in the Pescadero due to the issue related to anoxia and fishkills in the Pescadero Marsh downstream. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The two fish passage barriers impede migratory conditions for coho salmon and steelhead trout and impede natural geomorphic function upstream and downstream of the structures. Causes of Existing Problems at Sequoia Flats Crossing Site: This vehicle ford is the first of two fish passage barriers on Pescadero Creek to be addressed by the Project. The ford provides summer access across Pescadero Creek near the Sequoia Flat Family Campground. It is not used during the winter but remains in place across the creek. Because the crossing is overtopped during typical wintertime base flow the fundamental goal of the project was to provide juvenile movement during low flow stages reduce difficulties for entering the structure reduce maintenance and clogging issues and provide a better all-around fish passage conditions for the structure. The project was design to meet juvenile fish passage criteria from 3 cfs and a maximum of 20 cfs. Above 200 cfs and the structure is overtopped and fish passage is no longer needed through the structure. The structure is being replaced for several reasons; first the invert of the low flow opening/fish passage is high and as a result the structure has trapped sediment and degraded bed morphology conditions for approximately 600 feet upstream and second the current fish way structure is in disrepair clogs easily and is restricts juvenile passage during the low flow months. Also the slope of the structure general increases downstream. This accelerates flow and creates a jump into the structure at low flows for juvenile fish. The current velocities exceed juvenile passage criteria of 1 ft/sec throughout the structure. The structure can carry approximately 35 cfs before it over tops the concrete roadway. Adults can utilize the fishway at up 30 cfs but the entrance and the lower 20 feet or so of the structure has high velocities that are near or slightly exceed the CDFG passage criteria at these flows. Existing Problems at Seasonal Dam Site: The dam was established in 1938 and previously included flashboards that enabled the area to be used for swimming for Park visitors. These flashboards were also thought to support County Parks  water intake upstream. In 2001 when the flashboards were removed after serious discussion among County Parks and the fisheries agencies about how to address this barrier to fish passage at the site. Modifying the remaining concrete foundation of the dam is the second fish passage barrier to be addressed by the Project. The current barrier is approximately 1 to 3 feet tall depending on the flow and tailwater condition. The vertical drop of the dam is highest during low flows and can be drown out during very high flow conditions. It is generally believed that upstream migrating adult salmonids (especially steelhead which most regional models are based on) can pass the dam. Juveniles or younger fish however most likely cannot pass the up to 3-foot jump that can exist at the dam. The plunge pool at the base of the dam provides favorable conditions for jumping but the top of the dam is broad and flat and the shallow high-velocity flow creates difficult landing conditions for upstream migrating juveniles. In addition to the dam foundation there are wing walls and a concrete wall steps and pad that extend approximately 200 feet upstream of the dam on the north bank. The habitat conditions upstream of the dam are poor. The bed is relatively flat and wide the flow is generally shallow with few relatively shallow pools and there is an almost complete lack of cover and woody debris. These conditions are partly due to sediment that has been deposited in behind the dam and created a wide flat low-gradient channel. To some extent though the research immediately upstream of the dam is naturally straight and uniform and should function as a natural transport reach for sediment and wood. Channel complexity substrate size mid-channel vegetation and bars woody debris pools depth depth to width ratio and sinuosity begin to increase upstream of the dam with more favorable habitat existing approximately 950 feet upstream of the dam. ","Project Benefits: Spawning benefits: While most of the sites surveyed in the Pescadero basin by ESA in 2004 were found to provide adequate habitat for salmonid spawning and rearing including suitable spawning gravels frequent pools good riparian forest growth a favorable population of benthic macroinvertebrates and adequate water quality (especially temperature) and flows the highest quality salmonid habitat observed was found in the upper Pescadero basin including the upper mainstem of Pescadero Creek and in the following tributary streams: Tarwater Creek Peters Creek Slate Creek and Oil Creek Remediating these two fish passage barriers will provide unfettered access to the upper mainsteam and tributaries. The ESA work in 2004 and the 2010 NMFS Draft CCC Coho Recovery Plan both focus on the primary limiting factors with regards to salmonid habitat in the watershed as a lack of deep pool habitat limited amounts and frequency of large woody debris and relatively high levels of fine sediments. The design approach for remediating both of these barriers was baseds on both passage criteria as well as the ability to recreate more natural geomorphic conditions upstream and downstream of the crossings to help create and maintain gravel beds for salmonid spawning. Channel complexity that is necessary to create and sustain high quality spawning habitat will be enhanced through these projects by allowing more natural geomorphic processes to shape the channel (i.e. removing unnatural grade control and constrictions) and by removing the perceived need to remove LWD for protection of instream structures (i.e. County Parks will no longer need to removal LWD to project the dam and the crossing).Rearing benefits: ESA in its 2004 watershed assessment also found the same factors that applied to limiting creation of high quality spawning habitat and suggested these were also limiting rearing habitat. These limiting factors are likely to have a greater significance for coho salmon than steelhead based on the life history and environmental plasticity to each species. Coho in particular require deep pools with low water velocities and adequate cover for survival and growth while steelhead are more adapted to occupying and foraging in the faster and shallower areas of stream channels . The lack of deep sheltered pools and undercut banks in the reaches surveyed for the 2004 study and in preparation for the design work for both passage projects indicates that there is little suitable rearing habitat for coho salmon in and around the project reaches. The best salmonid rearing habitat is again within the upper Pescadero basin including the upper mainstem of Pescadero Creek. Remediating the fish passage barriers on the mainstem of the Pescadero at the Project sites will help to open access to coho to better rearing habitat. As such this project will allow rearing juveniles unfettered access to higher quality rearing habitat upstream as well as create conditions for deeper pools cover and velocity refuge to develop in the areas directly upstream and downstream of the passage projects. Moreover the current climate change models and redwood response models predict reduced summer baseflows flashier winter high flows and reduced redwood canopy and fog capture in lower elevation coastal redwood forests. Since species recovery is a long-term effort and must account for these potential changes juvenile access to upstream summer rearing habitat is likely to become even more critical as our climate continues to change. Also the bed upstream of these features is relatively flat and wide the flow is generally shallow with few relatively shallow pools and there is an almost complete lack of cover and woody debris. These conditions are partly due to sediment that has deposited in behind the dam and created a wide flat low-gradient channel.Fish passage benefits: The ESA 2004 study found that Pescadero Creek below Loma Mar provides moderate quality spawning and rearing habitat and that these reaches were most important as a migration corridors. Fish passage modeling was conducted at both sites to determine current passage limitations for juvenile and adult fish. For the dam removal project passage data were reviewed by the IWRP TAC and the current design developed collaboratively with DFG (with specific technical oversight by Marcin Whitman) and NMFS to ensure that DFG passage design criteria were met for a large range of flows and were hydraulically similar to \"natural\" conditions in adjacent reference reaches. The current barrier is approximately 1 to 3 feet tall depending on the flow and tailwater condition. The vertical drop of the dam is highest during low flows and can be drown out during very high flow conditions. It is generally believed that upstream migrating adult salmonids (especially steelhead which most regional models are based on) can pass the dam. Juveniles or younger fish however most likely cannot pass the up to 3-foot jump that can exist at the dam. The plunge pool at the base of the dam provides favorable conditions for jumping but the top of the dam is broad and flat and the shallow high-velocity flow creates difficult landing conditions for upstream migrating juveniles. The habitat conditions upstream of the dam are poor. The juvenile salmonids passage criteria specified in the CDFG Culvert Criteria for Fish Passage (2002) were used to design the dam removal cross section size and shape. These criteria are the following:1. Maximum average velocity of 1 foot per second with roughness features and velocity shelters (orachievement of conditions similar to the channel upstream and downstream)2. Minimum depth of 0.5 foot at low design flow3. Low design flow = 95-percent exceedance flow and4. High design flow = 10-percent exceedance flow.The low and high passage design flows are 1.1 and 69 cfs respectively. Hydraulic conditions for each of these flows were evaluated using a HEC-RAS model of the post-project conditions. The HEC-RAS outputs indicate the post-project velocity over the dam is approximately: 0.3 ft/s the low design flow (1.1 cfs) approximately 2.0 ft/s at the high design flow (69 cfs) and 1.0 ft/s at a discharge of 20 cfs. Although 2.0 ft/s exceeds the design criteria for juvenile salmonids it should be noted that the predicted velocities downstream of the pool below the dam are substantially higher than they are at the dam. Additionally the level of the notch is 1 foot lower than the minimum expected water surface elevation in the pool downstream and thus is backwatered to reduce velocities and provide a continuous passage route for fish. Again Marcin Whitman has reviewed these findings and the site conditions and written an official letter of approval for the project.For the Sequoia Flats Crossing the target species are also Coho and steelhead with an emphasis on juvenile movement. Because the crossing is overtopped during typical wintertime base flow the fundamental goal of the project was to provide juvenile movement during low flow stages reduce difficulties for entering the structure reduce maintenance and clogging issues and provide a better all around fish passage conditions for the structure. The project was design to meet juvenile fish passage criteria from 3 cfs and a maximum of 20 cfs. Above 200 cfs and the structure is overtopped and fish passage is no longer needed through the structure. The structure is being replaced for several reasons; first the invert of the low flow opening/fish passage is high and as a result the structure has trapped sediment and degraded bed morphology conditions for approximately 600 feet upstream and second the current fish way structure is in disrepair clogs easily and is restricts juvenile passage during the low flow months. Also the slope of the structure general increases downstream. This accelerates flow and creates a jump into the structure at low flows for juvenile fish. The current velocities exceed juvenile passage criteria of 1 ft/sec throughout the structure. The structure can carry approximately 35 cfs before it over tops the concrete roadway. Adults can utilize the fishway at up 30 cfs but the entrance and the lower 20 feet or so of the structure has high velocities that are near or slightly exceed the CDFG passage criteria at these flows.In summary implementation of these two projects will provide vastly improved passage conditions for juveniles will all unfettered passage for adults and will facilitate more natural geomorphic processes upstream and downstream of the existing structures -- potentially creating improved local rearing conditions.

"215 ","Corte Madera Bayfront Flood Protection and Wetlands Restoration Project ","The project seeks to integrate habitat and flood protection for properties along the Corte Madera Bayfront. It will restore historic tidal marsh and enhance seasonal wetlands in order to provide habitat for endangered and migratory species. It will provide flood protection for the commercial/industrial/residential area of Larkspur east of Highway 101 and improve storm water runoff in that area. ","('North Bay';) | Marin ","37.93891772986292-122.51163482666016 ","5/1/13 ","9/1/14 ","wetlands and elevated properties east of the north south RR right of way in Corte Madera and extending north around the portion of Larkspur which is east of Highway 101 and west of the RR right of way. ","Project Type Description: The area of Larkspur in need of flood protection presently has flooding related to storms and high tides with the water coming in from the bay and Corte Madera Creek. Preventing high tides from entering this area will also allow the storm water runoff to be redirected from direct return into the bay to existing retention ponds. Two disadvantaged communities reside in this area. Both are mobile home facilities with perhaps 150+ permanent residents. The habitat restoration component of the project result in a significant increase in the tidal marshes along Corte Madera Bay that before diking and filling extended for many miles up Corte Madera Creek. ","Detailed description: The Corte Madera Bay west of the SMART RR right of way includes the Corte Madera Ecological Reserve which is one of the most important remaining tidal marshes in the Bay. This shallow bay is also the location where there has been extensive filling and development of historic tidal marshes. What remains is a mix of developed uses along with important wildlife habitat especially the Corte Madera Ecological Reserve that protects 100 acres of historic tidal marsh and supports a core population of endangered California Clapper Rails. This Reserve also includes 300 acres of formerly diked but restored tidal marsh. Several areas outside of the Reserve boundary are included in this project because they have been degraded by past filling and diking. The largest is a 72 acre site owned by the GGBHTD that is currently seasonal wetlands and ruderal lands on which there is a massive invasion of non-native pampas grass. An adjoining 5 acre parcel currently is in private hands had previously been proposed as office space and/or housing. there has been a recent appraisal and the current owner is in discussions with Marin Audubon Society regarding the sale of this property. The RR right of way currently owned by SMART is the west boundary of the property. There are several trails on the properties used for recreational purposes . The GGBHTD wishes to use the majority of this 72 acre site as mitigation for projects it has planned at several of their ferry terminals. The result of both restorations would be to provide improved habitat for the endangered California Clapper Rail as well as local shorebirds and migratory species. Water quality in the bay would be improved by expanding the wetlands and improve the health of fish in the bay as well as providing for carbon sequestration. It would also help with flood protection for the communities that lie west of the RR right of way by providing a transitional zone of wetlands which buffer storm surges. Ultimately the Marin Audubon Society will make sure the grant is utilized to restore the marsh and then it will be turned over to Fish & Game for oversight. The communities of Corte Madera and Larkspur west of the the elevated RR right of way depend on the levee for flood protection from high tides and sea level rise. There has been settlement of the levee and the communities need the levee to be reinforced to provide protection in the future. The residential/commercial/industrial properties of Larkspur which are east of 101 are also at risk from high tides in the Corte Madera Creek. A detailed engineering study in 1998 was performed by AN West (Industrial Way/Lucky Drive Flood Control Project) but never implemented. This project included improving the levees and creating a flood barrier inboard from Corte Madera Creek to protect two disadvantaged communities of permanently installed mobile homes as well as the many businesses also located on this site. Removing the periodic high tide flooding which impacts this area would also result in storm water runoff going into retention ponds rather than flowing directly into the bay. ","Project Need: Sea level rise with high tides have impacted areas of Corte Madera and Larkspur over the past twenty years. The situation is worse due to subsidence of the land and more homes are at risk of flooding in the future. This project would protect those homes and businesses located west of the levee and east of 101 that are currently subject to flooding from high tides and storm water runoff. It would prevent water quality issues from deteriorating due to oil and other industrial materials being captured in storm waters that inundate homes and businesses in this area. The storm water runoff would be pumped into adjoining retention ponds to allow settlement of any noxious materials before the water is pumped into the bay. The residential area in question is a disadvantaged low income community consisting of two permanent mobile home communities with a population of 150+ individuals. Reinforcing the north south levee and adding wetlands that can dampen the effect of high tides and storm surges will also help to protect all communities west of the levee and the currently degraded lands will be restored to viable wetlands for improved wildlife habitat. The restored wetlands will also act as a transition zone for sea level rise. This will expand the wetlands adjoining the Corte Madera Ecological Reserve and will improve habitat for the endangered California Clapper Rail as well as shorebirds migratory waterfowl and anadromous fish. This project will expand and enhance one of the largest wetlands in Southern Marin by restoring the currently diked and degraded historic baylands. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The need to restore and expand existing wetlands will not occur and the ability of wetlands to support endangered species shorebirds and other migratory birds will be diminished. Wetlands are needed to help remove toxins from the bay and expanding wetlands to accomplish this goal should be a high priority. Wetlands will not be expanded to act as a sponge to help clean the bay support a healthy fish population and increase carbon sequestration. If the project is not implemented opportunities to expand the habitat for endangered species will not occur reducing the chance for recovery of the endangered California Clapper Rail. The current Corte Madera Ecological Reserve marshes provide critical habitat for this species and is described in the USFWS Recovery Plan for Tidal Marshes as a core Central Bay Population of Clapper Rails. The existing habitat is threatened by urban uses and uncontrolled access. This project would improve recreational access and expansion of the tidal marsh which will improve the recovery potential for this endangered species. Flooding problems in Corte Madera and Larkspur will increase with subsidence of properties and sea level rise will increase their vulnerability to flooding. If flood protection is not provided there will be increased storm water runoff of oil and other toxins found on streets yards and in business or industrial sites ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality ...Flooding causes water damage as well as exposure to oil biological waste and toxins that the flood waters pick up as they spread. Preventing residential homes and businesses from being inundated with flood waters as well as toxins will prevent exposure to potentially harmful flood waters. This will protect the existing water system from being compromised by the flood waters. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ...Currently storm water runoff goes directly into Corte Madera Creek or the SF Bay by providing flood protection the storm water runoff will first go into retention ponds for settlement before being pumped into the bay. By improving the levees and creating a flood barrier the Larkspur community will be protected from future flooding and sea level rise. Expanding wetlands will buffer the levee and lands from storm surges and high tides which will provide enhanced flood protection. Material removed from the sites can be used to restore the levee to FEMA standards where the material will not impact wetlands. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) ...This will expand one of the largest wetlands along the Southern Marin shore and help restore the health of the bay as well as providing improved habitat for the endangered California Clapper Rail migratory waterfowl and native shorebirds. Creating transitions/buffer zones will also help with flood protection and provide high tide refuge habitat for the Clapper Rail. Expanded wetlands will improve the health and the fish population of the bay. Trails will be environmentally sensitive and maintained along the levees for recreational purposes and several observation sites may be created for viewing the shorebirds and migratory species.

"217 ","Southwestern Solano County Open Space Acquisition and Watershed Assessment "," ","('North Bay';) | Solano ","38.180112421915794 | -122.19659328460693 ","03/01/13 ","Oct 2015 ","The property to be acquired is comprised of two parcels totaling about 275-acres and is located in southwestern Solano County at the intersection of American Canyon Road and I-80 between the cities of Vallejo and Fairfield. It is adjacent to (southwest) of Lynch Canyon an approximate 1000-acre working ranch in western Solano County owned and operated by Solano Land Trust. ","Project Type Description: The project improves water quality by keeping watershed headwaters as well-managed open space. Erosion and sediment flow issues will be minimized through assessment and future implementation of erosion control projects. The acquisition will improve stormwater flow rates under I-80 culverts and downstream in American Canyon Creek by protecting and preserving broad floodplains and wetlands on the property. Habitats on the property will be protected by preservation of the property in perpetuity by the Solano Land Trust. The project envisions watershed and resource assessments that result in designing future enhancement projects for wetlands riparian corridors raptors and native grasslands. The property has easy access to local bike paths (McGary Road between the City of Vallejo and city of Fairfield) and the regional hiking trail the Bay Area Ridge Trail. The City of Vallejo is a disadvantaged community and planned public access on this property has the potential to be well used by citizens of this community because it is only a few miles to the north. ","Detailed description: The project has two phases the first phase is the acquisition of the property and the second phase is assessment of watershed health and resources and planning public access. Solano Land Trust (SLT) has partnered with Solano County to receive federal earmark funds for the purchase of open space with potential development of trails. These parcels proposed for purchase known as the Brown-Souza properties located in southwestern Solano County were selected because of willing sellers and their location adjacent to two existing open spaces: Lynch Canyon (Solano County) and Newell Open Space (Napa County). The properties are scenic grasslands with ridgeline views of San Pablo Bay Cities of Vallejo and Napa and inland hills. They contain areas of native grasslands riparian waterways and freshwater wetlands. The acquisition has an 80% match committed through federal funds and we are seeking the remaining 20% match with this application. Resource assessment is an essential part of future management of the property for open space. For the Brown-Souza properties SLT is proposing a watershed assessment similar to that completed at the adjacent Lynch Canyon for the purpose of prioritizing watershed health enhancements such exclusion fencing for riparian areas and springs designing and implementing erosion control projects and restoring native grasslands freshwater wetlands and riparian areas. The watershed assessment will survey creek sections evaluate stream hydrology map native vegetation and invasive plants and prioritize problem areas where the creek is undersized unstable or without cover. Resource assessment will inventory the plant communities and wildlife evaluate hydrology and geomorphology and assess the area s habitat potential. The watershed work will designate areas on the property that have the potential to restore habitat for sensitive species such as the California red-legged frog or nesting raptors and evaluate the potential to partner with the Solano County Habitat Conservation Plan. SLT will complete the watershed and resource assessment prior to planning public access infrastructure so that impacts to sensitive areas are avoided or minimized. Public access is active at the adjacent Lynch Canyon and is administered by Solano County Parks Department. Pursuant to amending our agreement that agency will also administer access on these new parcels. The trail network at Lynch Canyon could link to trails that will be planned at these new parcels. This network could provide an essential link to the Bay Area Ridge Trail. Access to the Brown-Souza parcels is from an existing I-80 freeway frontage road at the American Canyon Road exit. ","Project Need: This project is a combination acquisition and watershed assessment project. When federal funding became available for acquisition of open space with trails the Solano Land Trust (SLT) was contacted to be the potential owner and operator of this property for public open space. Solano County is the only county in the Bay Area that does not have a regional park district to acquire open space for preservation and recreational purposes. SLT functions in Solano County to purchase and maintain open space in trust for the public. However because SLT is a private non-profit we do not have a source of funding for acquisition and must seek outside funding to do so. This requested funding will match the 80% exiting funding and also provide funds to implement public access in a manner that preserves and protects the watershed and its resources. The project benefits are many including: watershed protection riparian habitat enhancement agriculture and public access available on the property in a manner that does not impact resources and implementation of regional plans for open space in the County. The addition of these 275 acres adds to the adjacent 1000-acre Lynch Canyon Space and the 640-acre Newell Open Space for a total of 1915-acres of open space that will eventually be open to the public. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the project is not implemented SLT will have to seek funding from other sources or lose this opportunity to purchase this land and add to existing open space property. The citizens of Solano county would lose the opportunity for this key purchase. There are not many sources of acquisition funding to match federal funds at this time. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply The project will protect 275-acres of upper watershed lands that drain into Suisun Bay. ii. Water Quality The project will provide in perpetuity protection and management of upper watershed lands. The Solano Land Trust will assess these lands for resource protection and prioritize erosion control and sediment flow issues in these ephemeral drainage for remedies. In perpetuity management will protect water quality through grazing management public access management and periodic watershed health assessments. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Protection and managing the upper watershed to include vegetated riparian buffers and creek floodplains will decrease flood risks downstream. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The acquisition of the 275-acre project area by the County/Solano Land Trust partnership will preserve the area in perpetuity for open space. The land protected adds to existing protected lands thus increasing its value for watershed habitat and recreation. The project will provide the baseline for watershed management through assessment of watershed health and resources within one year of purchase. The project will provide outdoor low-impact recreational opportunities to nearby disadvantaged communities. Up to 5 miles of trails may be planned on these parcels. The trail connections to the Bay Area Ridge Trail on the adjacent open space is important to create linkage in this network. The project will provide wildlife habitat enhancement including that for: California red-legged frogs and other wetland species; raptors including golden eagles and other raptor species that are both resident and migratory; and nesting grassland birds. The project will protect water quality by defining vegetative buffers to riparian corridors freshwater wetlands and springs. The project will increase stewardship opportunities by providing projects for local volunteer groups and schools as well as tours for visitors to highlight the importance of our local wildlife and vegetation to the larger watershed systems. The site has the potential to develop increased environmental education due to its proximity to local cities. ... ","  "," ","Solano Land Trust ","0","1","0","1","0","0","1","0"

","Project Type Description: ","Detailed description: Since the fall of 2009 staff from the SFCJPA and one of its member agencies the Santa Clara Valley Water District have been analyzing what capital improvements are necessary to provide 100-year flood protection for the flood prone reach of San Francisquito Creek upstream of U.S. Highway 101. Creek capacity improvements being analyzed include bridge replacement channel widening and naturalization floodwall construction or enhancement a bypass culvert and upstream detention facility. It is likely that a suite of these alternatives will be required to address the flooding problem. This analysis is being conducted locally but adheres to Army Corps of Engineers  planning standards. It is also important to note that improvement to the flow capacity would not be constructed until project improvements at U.S. Highway 101 and downstream to the San Francisco Bay are completed. The alternatives being considered consist of various project elements. Some of the elements are well developed and will move into the design phase in the near term. These elements will be analyzed at the project level in a Programmatic EIR in the spring of 2013. Other elements are less developed and are still being analyzed for technical feasibility. These elements will be analyzed at the program level in the Programmatic EIR. 50-year Flood Protection Baseline Project Elements:When constructed these Project elements would provide for conveyance of the approximately 50-year flow event along the Project reach. These elements represent the  baseline project  and are a needed part of any project alternative being contemplated to achieve protection from the 100-year flow event. Bridge crossings at Newell Road University Avenue Pope/Chaucer Street and Middlefield Road would be modified to convey up to the 100-year flow event however conveyance would be restricted to the maximum downstream channel flow capacity (50-year event) by temporary structural measures. Removal of these structural measures would be included as part of a future 100-year project that would also include downstream improvements. The project area also includes 6 channel constrictions or bottlenecks that impede conveyance. These bottle-necks would be widened to improve channel hydraulics and effectively reduce water surface elevations in the channel during storm events. 100-year Flood Protection Project Elements: Additional project elements are still being developed and one or more of these would be implemented in conjunction with the bridge and bottleneck elements mentioned above to provide protection from the 100-year flow event along the Project reach. The environmental impacts of these elements would be evaluated in the EIR at the program level. These elements include:   Flood walls from Highway 101 to Pope/Chaucer   A 4000  underground bypass culvert that would extend under Woodland Ave. between Highway 101 and University Avenue or under Highway 101 at University Avenue and east on O Connor Street to the Bay.   Detention basins on Stanford-owned land in the upper watershed. Within each of the alternatives project elements will be included that provide for ecosystem restoration and recreational enhancements when possible. These elements will likely include bank stabilization and revegetation of riparian habitat fish passage barrier removal/modification bike and pedestrian trails and interpretive signage.

"219 ","Bolinas Avenue Stormwater Quality Improvements and Fernhill Creek Restoration ","This project will restore drainage patterns to Fernhill Creek located south of Bolinas Avenue install storm water infiltration systems on Bolinas Avenue and improve the Bolinas Avenue storm drainage system. ","('North Bay';) | Marin ","37.9683353 | -122.5645442 ","Fall 2013 ","Fall 2015 ","Bolinas Avenue borders the Town of Ross and Town of San Anselmo. Fernhill Creek is located south of Bolinas Avenue and generally parallel along the rear property boundaries of the homes fronting Bolinas Avenue. ","Project Type Description: This project will increase infiltration improve water quality and increase the capacity of ground water recharge through the use of bioretention planter areas along Bolinas Avenue. This project will improve the existing storm drain system and add flood protection by increasing the storm drain capacity along Bolinas Avenue and divert a significant portion of stormwater runoff (30% or more) to Fernhill Creek away from the storm drain system. The restoration of Fernhill Creek would help restore historical riparian habitat to the area. ","Detailed description: This project includes three elements related to storm water quality and drainage: Over the years Fernhill Creek has been piped filled in fenced and otherwise obstructed making the creek ineffective for stormwater conveyance. Many of the homeowners have installed pumps that pump water onto Bolinas Avenue contributing to the flooding that occurs. Other stormwater that should have entered Fernhill Creek at the west end of Bolinas Avenue also appears to have been diverted by streets and storm drains to Bolinas Avenue. One of the project goals is to restore historic flows to Fernhill Creek so that storm flows on Bolinas Avenue will be reduced. This will also have the potential to increase the infiltration of water and improve water quality. It may also be possible to increase bioretention on Fernhill Creek if property owners are willing to allow it. Grant money would be used to restore the creek increase restrictive culverts and introduce bioretention opportunities.Make Bolinas Avenue a  green street  by creating bioretention in the planter strip areas along the street which will increase stormwater infiltration decrease flows and improve water quality. There may be opportunities to increase bio-retention and reduce impervious surfaces by replacing on-street parking with bio-retention ponds.Based on the hydrology and hydraulic analyses completed to date and the limited capacity of Fernhill Creek (even after restoration) a new culvert system will be needed on Bolinas Avenue to alleviate the flooding in the vicinity of the Richmond Road and Bolinas Avenue intersection. Without diversions to Fernhill Creek a culvert system of 48-inch and 54-inch culverts would be required to convey the 69 cubic feet per second to Corte Madera Creek at the downstream side of the Sir Francis Drake Boulevard Bridge south of Bolinas Avenue. If flows can be restored to Fernhill Creek it is anticipated there will be a 30% reduction in the flows along Bolinas Avenue. ","Project Need: Bolinas Avenue has had flooding problems spanning several decades. A preliminary hydrology and hydraulics study of Bolinas Avenue verified that the existing stormwater system is severely undersized a problem that primarily was caused by the diversion of water from Fernhill Creek onto Bolinas Avenue. This project targets the flooding problems on Bolinas Avenue while also improving stormwater quality and restoring historic stream flow which will in turn improve water quality reduce flooding and improve habitat values. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The intersection of Bolinas Avenue and Richmond Road will continue to flood causing: water to flood buildings and introduce contaminants into the surface watersflooding of the sewer system introducing raw sewage and potentially deadly bacteria into surface watersobstruction of pedestrian access on a school routetraffic delays on a school and emergency vehicle route. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) The addition of bio-retention areas on Bolinas Avenue would slow stormwater down filtering the stormwater and allowing for greater infiltration. This will improve both the capacity and quality of groundwater in the area. ii. Water Quality By adding bio-retention areas along Bolinas Avenue a portion of the stormwater runoff will be filtered before entering the storm drain system thereby improving water quality. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management The existing storm drain system is severely undersized. This project would simultaneously increase the capacity of the storm drain system and divert a significant portion of stormwater runoff (30% or more) to Fernhill Creek away from the storm drain system. iv.

The new well and tank would be installed on a parcel currently owned by the County in the vicinity of two existing CSA 11 water supply wells located approximately one mile west of the Town in unincorporated San Mateo County California. The current water supply system is estimated to last between zero (0) to four (4) additional years. The project would provide better access to the groundwater aquifer that was identified to provide sufficient storage to supply the community and would not increase the amount of extracted groundwater.

","Project Type Description: This project will help to ensure a reliable drinking water supply for Pescadero residents within CSA 11. A study conducted in 2001 by Todd Engineers hypothesized that the shallow configuration of the current CSA 11 drinking water wells causes a localized drop in aquifer water levels. Drilling a deeper well at a lower elevation will allow water to be extracted more reliably and efficiently without increasing the amount of groundwater extracted. The additional storage tank will increase the capacity of the water system to continue providing adequate water supply in the event of an emergency. Water conservation efforts will help to protect groundwater resources within CSA 11's drinking water aquifer located on a ridge one mile west of the Town. Water conservation will also benefit water quality within the alluvial aquifer located directly beneath the Town by reducing discharge from septic systems. The population of CSA 11 users have a median household income (MHI) of less than 80% of the State MHI potentially qualifying them as a Disadvantaged Community. ","Detailed description: The County of San Mateo Department of Public Works and Parks (County) proposes to construct a new municipal water well and storage tank for the purpose of extending the life of the drinking water supply and providing adequate emergency response for the County Service Area 11 (CSA 11) Water System (also known as the Pescadero Community Water System) which serves approximately 100 households within the Town of Pescadero (Town). The new well and storage tank would be installed on a parcel currently owned by the County in the vicinity of two existing CSA 11 water supply wells located approximately one mile west of the Town in unincorporated San Mateo County California. The current water supply system is estimated to last from zero (0) to four (4) additional years. The project would provide better access to the groundwater aquifer that was identified to provide sufficient storage to supply the community and would not increase the amount of extracted groundwater. The County will be responsible for maintenance and monitoring of the Pescadero water system including the new municipal water well and tank. Additional measures will be implemented to ensure a safe and reliable water supply system. The new 140000 gallon storage tank would be installed adjacent to the existing storage tank. The installation of the new well would consist of an approximately 16-inch diameter well hole drilled to a depth of 100 feet below mean sea level in order to intercept a deeper portion of the Pigeon Point Formation aquifer. Upon completion of the well installation pumping tests would be conducted to determine appropriate pumping rates and target efficiency. A permanent pump small pump house and connections to the existing storage tanks would then be installed. The well pump and associated monitoring equipment would be contained within a small pump house located over or immediately adjacent to the well head. An underground water transmission line would be constructed to deliver water from the well to the storage tanks. Electrical power for operation of the pump would be taken from the existing overhead electrical distribution lines at the storage tanks. In addition the County proposes to use grant funding to initiate a water conservation program for the Pescadero community served by CSA 11. Given the low-income status of CSA 11 households the County is planning to provide residents with low- or no-cost high efficiency toilet and washer replacement options. Additional water saving measures may include low flow faucet and shower heads and rainwater harvesting devices. Traditional rebate programs can exclude low-income communities from participating in water efficiency replacement programs where residents cannot afford to invest in a new toilet or washer and then wait as long as 8 weeks to be issued rebates. Therefore the County intends to recruit local community-based organizations (CBOs) to assist the County in management of the toilet and washer replacement program. The County and/or CBOs may perform the following tasks: public outreach and education efforts; household surveys to determine number of qualifying items needed; purchase warehouse and distribute new items; and dispose of old items appropriately. Funding for the replacement program may be provided to the CBOs up-front if the terms of the grant allow it. Local plumbers would be recruited to perform installations and post-installation monitoring. ","Project Need: Prior to 1993 the Town's supply of drinking water depended on small domestic wells water from surface impoundments and locally derived groundwater from wells installed in the alluvial aquifer of Pescadero and Butano Creeks. In the 1970's and 1980's these sources were found to contain relatively high concentrations of nitrate and other naturally occurring salts. This situation prompted the development of an alternative groundwater source located near the top of a hill one mile west of the Town. Two wells (one test well and one municipal water well) have been the Town's source of drinking water and fire protection since 1993. In April 2001 the County retained an engineering consultant to assess the long-term reliability of the water source for the Town's water system. The assessment concluded that based on the current pumping rate the existing wells would fail in 8 to 15 years estimating failure to occur between 2009 and 2016 (Todd Engineers 2002). The report hypothesized that the shallow configuration of the current wells causes a localized drop in aquifer water levels. The consultant recommended installation of a new municipal water well in the vicinity of the existing wells. Drilling a deeper well at a lower elevation will allow water to be extracted more reliably and efficiently without increasing the amount of groundwater extracted. Installation of a new municipal water well would extend the life of CSA 11's water supply to at least 38 years. Installation of an additional storage tank will increase the capacity of the water system to continue providing adequate water supply in the event of an emergency. Implementation of a water conservation program will further reduce water supply demand and help achieve the ultimate goal of a sustainable water supply system. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If a new deeper municipal water supply well is not constructed for the CSA 11 Water System the existing water supply wells could fail temporarily or permanently due to the localized drop in aquifer levels. An engineering assessment conducted in 2001 estimated failure to occur between 2009 and 2016 (Todd Engineers 2002). Permanent well failure would result in the need to find an alternate source of water which could require drilling of new wells in other areas water treatment and/or long distance distribution line installation and maintenance. The second storage tank would increase the capacity of the water system to continue providing adequate water supply in the event of an emergency such as pump failure natural disaster or major fire. Water shortages or outages due to inadequate water supply would result in the need for bottled water delivery boil water notices and the temporary closure of local businesses. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) Installation of a new municipal water well would extend the life of CSA 11's water supply to at least 38 years. Installation of an additional water storage tank would increase the capacity of the water system to continue providing adequate water supply in the event of an emergency. Implementation of a water conservation program will further reduce water supply demand and help achieve the ultimate goal of a sustainable water supply system. The estimated quantity of water used by CSA 11 is approximately 25 acre-feet per year. Installation of 120 High Efficiency Toilets and 80 High Efficiency Washers could result in an annual total water savings of 4 acre-feet or a 16% reduction in water use. ii.

This will restore design flood capactiy and convert upland areas back into wetlands. ","('East Bay';) | Contra Costa County ","37.989509 | -122.068460 ","August 2016 ","October 2016 ","Grayson creek between confluence with Walnut Creek to Chilpancingo Parkway in Pacheco and Pleasant Hill ","Project Type Description: The removal of accumulated sediment from the channel will return the channel to its design capacity to reduce flood risk to the surrounding community. This desilting project will also lower in-channel upland areas to turn the areas back to wetlands. ","Detailed description: The Grayson Creek Channel was constructed in the 1960s by federal partners (USACE and NRCS) and is generally a wide trapezoidal earthen channel. It's location near the bottom of the watershed means that the channel is slow moving and sediment deposition is common. The channel requires periodic sediment removal to maintain flood capacity. The last comprehensive sediment removal project was in 2006 and the next is anticipated to be needed around 2016. In 2006 the disposal of the material was challenging. The 32000 cy of material ended up going to a local park that was making a large wildlife viewing mound. Ideally the material would go to a project that is creating wetlands or adjusting marsh elevations to accommodate sea level rise. This project will remove approximately 35000 cy of accumulated sediment in Grayson Creek at selected locations between it's confluence with Walnut Creek and Chilpancingo Parkway a distance of about 9000 LF . Sediment would be removed from specific selected areas based on the channel cross section and the habitat type affected. Generally the sediment is removed from areas mapped as uplands and wetlands typically establish in the now lower area once the sediment has been removed. Because Grayson Creek is dynamic and sediment moves downstream each season the exact areas to be desilted will be determined by a topographic survey and wetland delineation closer to construction. The work is typically accomplished in the dry using traditional and long reach excavators working either from the adjacent channel maintenance road or from upland areas on the channel floodplain bench. The material is deposited directly into waiting trucks for offhaul and disposal (or ideally reuse). ","Project Need: Historically before development of the adjacent floodplain with residential and commercial uses Grayson Creek would periodically flood and deposit its sediment load on its broad floodplain. This improved the quality of the soils and kept the channel in balance. Unfortunately the development of the floodplain in the mid 20th century meant that the floodwaters (and the sediment) needed to stay within the creek. Flooding the neighborhood wasn't an option. The creek was channelized requiring periodic removal of the accumulated sediment. This project is also needed to prevent the seasonal wetlands present on the channel bottom from turning into uplands as more and more sediment is dumped on them. The sediment removal process (or 'desilting') will restore the design level of flood protection and will also restore wetlands that have been lost due to the natural deposition of sediments. This project is needed to restore proper function to Grayson Creek. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the proposal is not implemented Grayson Creek channel will be undersized to handle large flood events and the surrounding areas will be exposed to increased flood risk. Wetland areas in the channel will continue to be inundated with sediment and convert into uplands. ","Project Benefits: i.

","Project Type Description: Water Quality: Improves water quality through sustainable sediment management measures and reduction in contaminants from animal waste. Stormwater Improvement: Increases stormwater detention and enables sustainable sediment flow. Habitat protection and restoration: restores riparian vegetation and improves conditions for aquatic wildlife (allows for fish passage downstream). Flood protection: Enables the San Lorenzo Creek flood control channel to improve 100-year flood protection. ","Detailed description: Three major tributaries Eden Hollis and Palomares flow into Don Castro Reservoir in the upper watershed carrying approximately 12000 cubic yards of sediment each year from both natural and human-caused erosive processes. Today Don Castro Reservoir is nearly filled with sediment and does not have the capacity to provide flood protection. To return the reservoir s water holding capacity to the original design levels it is estimated that 500000 cubic yards of sediment need to be removed a total volume that would fill the Oakland Coliseum three stories high. Raising the major dam and improving the reservoir infrastructure already in place together with key modifications to the dam outfall structure will also allow sustainable sediment management techniques and the dam and reservoir can play a critical role in downstream flood protection. A new hydraulic model of San Lorenzo Creek indicates that holding water upstream in Don Castro Reservoir during high flood flows has the greatest impact on reducing the amount of water in the lower creek system. For example increasing water holding capacity and reducing the amount of water flowing downstream during a major storm by one-third could decrease the amount of water flowing into the San Lorenzo Creek flood control system to the level that the channel was originally designed for. The new dam mechanism will dynamically manage water levels to increase holding capacity when needed. The two-phase San Lorenzo Creek Flood Control Project relies on several components in the upper watershed and downstream working together to improve water retention and drainage and minimize future sedimentation of the reservoir. Phase 2 of the project involves modifying Don Castro Dam (5-ft dam raise) removing sediment and installing a mechanism for sustainable sediment flow. Phase 1 (listed as a separate project) will include construction of new 4-ft high floodwalls along roughly 3500 ft of the San Lorenzo Creek flood control channel downstream. Projects 1 and 2 together will enable the San Lorenzo Creek flood control channel to provide protection relative to the higher 1% annual chance stormflow (16000 cfs instead of the original 10400 cfs). ","Project Need: Flood Control Safety: Safety is a key factor. Communities downstream of Don Castro Dam/Reservoir are at risk of flooding if there is a major storm event. FEMA has de-accredited the San Lorenzo Creek flood control channel stating that stormwater would flow over the top of the channel during a 1% chance storm. Economic Loss: Flooding would cause an economic loss to individuals families businesses and communities downstream of the reservoir. FEMA s updated FIRMs have placed 1800 properties in the Lorenzo Creek area in Special Flood Hazard Areas. Property owners with federally backed mortgages are now required to purchase flood insurance. Water Quality: Is currently compromised by levels of sediment and contaminants from animal waste. Recreation: Don Castro Reservoir can no longer provide amenities it once had. For example fishing docks once built over water deep enough for fish are now almost surrounded by sediment. Wildlife Habitat: Fish and other aquatic wildlife are compromised by shallower warmer water caused by increasing sedimentation. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Community health and safety is at risk. Economic loss to community. Loss of wildlife/aquatic habitat and recreation facilities. ","Project Benefits: Improves water quality through sustainable sediment management measures. Provides critical flood protection for a few thousand parcels minimizing risk of loss of life community disruption and costly flood damage.

By reducing the City's reliance on Delta supplies the project could result in additional supply left in the Delta. This would in turn provide water quality benefits for Delta supplies. In addition replacing the existing well will improve the quality of drinking water provided to City of Pittsburg residents. This project will increase water supply reliability while maintaining quality thus maintaining regional recycled water quality. The data collected from the new Rossmoor Well will help characterize the groundwater basin to increase knowledge of the basin and protect against overdraft. By reducing the City's reliance on Delta supplies the project could result in additional supply left in the Delta. This would in turn provide water quality benefits for Delta supplies resulting in higher quality aquatic habitat in the Delta. Increasing groundwater production will reduce reliance on purchasing surface water from CCWD reducing water supply costs for DACs within the City's service area. ","Detailed description: In order to meet future water demands the City of Pittsburg will replace the existing Rossmoor Groundwater Well with a larger capacity well (~1200 gallons per minute [gpm]) and about 1500 feet of the 8-inch pipeline will be replaced with 10- or 12-inch pipeline to allow for increased use of the Pittsburg Groundwater Basin. The City currently relies mostly on purchased raw surface water from the Delta from Contra Costa Water District and supplements the remaining water demands with groundwater. The surface and groundwater is treated at the City s water treatment plant prior to delivery to its residents. The City produces groundwater from two wells one of which the Rossmoor Well has experienced biofouling which has caused a noticeable decline in the groundwater production. By replacing the existing well the City will obtain a more reliable groundwater supply and will be able to meet customer demands now and in the future while reducing dependence on the Delta. An IS/MND will be prepared for the Project. In parallel planning & design will be completed. Currently there is no specific design for the well beyond the size & materials. Well design (intervals & lengths of well screen/casing) will be completed following drilling & will be based on site-specific hydrogeology as observed in the field. ","Project Need: The City of Pittsburg relies primarily on surface water to meet its potable water demands. Approximately 90% of its water demands are met with raw surface water purchased from Contra Costa Water District. The remaining 10% of water demands are met by groundwater which is pumped from two City wells and blended with the surface water. One of the wells that the City pumps groundwater from for supply is the Rossmoor Well. It was constructed in 1991 and has experienced a decline in capacity (750 gpm to 590 gpm) due to biofouling. Because of this issue it has required rehabilitation work and chemical treatments in 2001 2004 2009 and 2010. Replacing the existing well will improve water supply reliability by allowing for increased groundwater production. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the Rossmoor well is not replaced with a new well capacity will continue to decline reducing water supply available to the City. The City would also have to continue to perform rehabilitation and preventative treatments and/or increase the amount of Delta water purchased from Contra Costa Water District. ","Project Benefits: The project will provide the following benefits: 1. Improve water supply reliability by increasing groundwater production. 2. Characterize the groundwater basin by using data collected from the well to increase knowledge of the basin and protect against overdraft. 3. Improve Delta water quality by reducing the City's reliance on Delta supplies potentially leaving additional supply in the Delta. 4.

In addition to further increase floodwater conveyance the project removes sediment from the San Francisco Bay to the Union Pacific Railroad tracks. Opportunities to integrate creek daylighting as part of these enhancements should be considered where possible when detailed design plans and specifications are developed. Background The Bockman Canal system is a series of engineered storm drains that drain the western watershed area south of San Lorenzo Creek. The system has insufficient capacity to convey the flow anticipated in a 1% annual chance storm event. While this area does not drain into San Lorenzo Creek surrounding properties would be flooded by San Lorenzo Creek in a major storm. For this reason this area is considered a subwatershed of the San Lorenzo Creek watershed. As such properties in the area would directly benefit from overall improvements to the San Lorenzo Creek flood management system including modifications to Don Castro Dam and Reservoir sediment removal and constructing the San Lorenzo Creek floodwall (San Lorenzo Creek Flood Control Project HS1). These improvements in combination with the Bockman Canal capacity/crossing enhancements and targeted sediment removal will provide much greater protection to both Bockman Canal area properties and areas throughout San Lorenzo as a whole. As with all capacity enhancements proposed throughout the watershed implementation of drainage system upgrades should seek to incorporate creek daylighting and naturalistic channel improvements in coordination with local planning efforts to accomplish the broadest range of community objectives.

The Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District undertook the Tule Ponds Project to develop a wetlands-based storm water treatment system at Tyson Lagoon. The site is a 17-acres centered around a sag pond in Fremont. The site has three constructed ponds that hold water during the during parts of the year located to the east of the sag pond. The three ponds were connected by a channel and designed to filter watersequentially as it flows from the urban watershed drains into the ponds. The constructed and natural ponds together with the wetland vegetation removes sediment and pollutants from the water prior to discharging out into San Francisco Bay. The site also supports a variety of native plants and animal which has allowed the center to become a major education center for elementary and middle school teachers and students. The site is located on Walnut Street in the City Fremont and is easily accessible by public transportation. ","Project Type Description: The treatment ponds remove pollutants from stomwater prior to discharge into San Francisco Bay. The site also has native flora and fauna including special status species that will be protected. The project also includes construction of a demonstration Native American village that is already included in the site environmental education program. The curriculum also includes study of the site geology and earthquake faults and the natural history and development of the sag pond at the site. ","Detailed description: Tule Ponds at Tyson Lagoon is a \"Wetland in the City.\" This innovative area is used for flood control but also as a wildlife sanctuary for the many species that live in an urban environment. The17- acre site has three constructed ponds that receive urban waters. Sediments deposit with the slow down of the flows in the ponds. Wetland vegetation further removes pollutants from the water. The project proposes to rehabilitate the 10 year old education building on site to include enlargement and replacing existing water and lighting new energy efficient systems; upgrade pathways and bridge crossings to ADA standards; and construct and that expand the classroom space of the building; and add a deck to the existing building to provide staging area for walking through the 17-acre facility. The existing parking lot will be converted to install features that demonstrate LID as part of the site education program. To continue providing the environmental experience to these elementary and middle schools the site will update its existing boat and dock and acquire a boat that can be used to ferry students including the visually impaired on the lagoon to observe the flora and fauna. ","Project Need: The increasing use of and demand for the center has resulted in inadequate capacity in the Education Center building. The wooden bridges crossing the ponds and flood plain are deteriorating. The pathways awe not ADA compliant and therefore limit access to many portions of the 17-acre site. In addition LID features will be installed to add to the site's educational value. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The site constructed ponds require resizing and reconstruction to assure adequate water retention during the winter moths. If improvements are not made the water quality function provided by the ponds will diminish allowing untreated storm water to discharge into the Bay. Additionally schools' participation will be limited. Many students would not be exposed to the available educational programs and the hands-on experience of exploring the site. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) The Existing Sag pond is a good example for students to see on how to maintain clean water quality. The training provided to students at the site is important in developing environmental awareness and stewardship in students from an early age. ii. Water Quality National Pollution Discharge Elimination System and the Municipal Regional Permits requires Municipalities to implement measures to reduce pollutants in storm water discharging into the Bay.

"230 ","City of Hayward Recycled Water Project ","The proposed project consists of installing a new Recycled Water Facility (RWF) located at the City's Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) at 3700 Enterprise Avenue. The RWF will deliver an estimated 290 acre-feet per year (AFY) of recycled water to 24 customers within the City of Hayward. The RWF will be served by approximately 1.5-miles of 8-inch diameter distribution lines to the north and south of the WPCF rehabilitation and connection to an existing and abandoned Shell Oil Pipeline (or construction of a new pipeline if an Agreement with Shell Oil is not reached) and over 3 miles of laterals to customers including installation of customer connections.

Several key steps have been completed to assess the viability of the project—an initial Feasibility Study was completed in 2007 and a more detailed Recycled Water Facilities Plan was firs ","Located within a 2-mile radius of the City's Water Pollution Control Facility at 3700 Enterprise Avenue ","Project Type Description: This recycled water project will supplement the City's potable water supplies which are provided by the San Francisco Regional Water System (Hetch Hetchy) and improve water supply reliability in the region. This project will reduce the amount of diversion from the Tolumne River which will improve flow conditions and benefit the river habitat. Also by releasing reduced amounts of treated wastewater to the Bay it will benefit the San Francisco Bay ecosystem. ","Detailed description: General Project Concept - The City of Hayward Recycled Water Project has been developed to increase the City s water supply portfolio and to reduce its reliance on SFPUC Regional Water System. The proposed project involves the construction of 1.5 miles of distribution lines to the north and south of the Hayward Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) rehabilitation and connections to an existing Shell Oil pipeline over three miles of customer laterals to 24 customers and installation of customer connections and retrofits. The project would deliver an estimated average of 260000 gpd or 290 AFY of recycled water for cooling towers boiler feed and irrigation. The City also anticipates utilizing excess tertiary treated recycled water from the Russell City Energy Center a 600 megawatt electrical energy generation facility located adjacent to the WPCF. Project Construction and Implementation - Distribution from the WPCF will be through two parallel 8-inch main pipelines to serve the north and south branches of Whitesell Road. The south branch will serve a cluster of recycled water customers in the area between the WPCF and Highway 92. The north branch will connect to the existing Shell Oil pipeline (8-inch) which will be rehabilitated for water use. Flow through the Shell Oil pipeline will split to customers on the north and south ends of the pipeline. Connections will be made into the Shell Oil pipeline for 6-inch laterals to a single customer or customer grouping. These customer laterals vary from a few yards to three quarters of a mile. The City is pursuing an agreement with Shell Oil to purchase the abandoned 8-inch diameter pipeline that could form the backbone of the distribution system. In the event that an Agreement with Shell Oil is not reached City will construct its own 8-inch recycled water pipeline. Treatment methods - The tertiary treated facilities at Russell City Energy Center include filtration (pretreatment using incline plate clarifiers and granular media filtration) and chlorination. If the City constructs its own treatment facility the process train at the planning level is expected to include filtration (pretreatment using flocculating clarifier and granular media filtration) and chlorination. This process train will be finalized during design. Key benefits to the City: (1) Economic growth and development - provides water for non-potable industrial uses and supports redevelopment of industrial areas near WPCF (2) Diversifying Water Sources - provides 290 AFY of locally-controlled drought-proof water supply for non-potable sources and reduces dependence on SFPUC imported water (3) Environmental Protection - reduces mass loading of regulated constituents to San Francisco Bay (4) Sustainability - conserves potable water for its highest uses and beneficial re-use of an existing City-owned resource. Potential Benefits to Other Stakeholders : (1) SFPUC/BAWSCA - reduces demand on SFPUC imported water system (2) SWRCB - assists in meeting statewide recycled water targets and extends Stae water supply with 290 AFY of drought-proof non-potable water Regional coordination - The project is included in the 2013 Bay Area IRWMP. ","Project Need: Dependence on SFPUC Regional Water System - The City of Hayward Water System serves a community of about 147000 residents industrial and office parks commercial areas golf courses recreational parks an airport schools college and a State University. The City receives 100% of its water supply from the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) which consists predominantly of snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada mountains and is delivered through the Hetch Hetchy aqueducts. Hayward shares its sole water supply with 25 other wholesale customers as well as the City of San Francisco. Although Hayward's contract with SFPUC does not include a cap on water deliveries the SFPUC has limited average water deliveries to wholesale customers to 184 mgd collectively at least through 2018. Development of additional water recycling conservation and groundwater projects is proposed to bridge the potential gap between demand and supply. The Hayward Recycled Water Project would offset the demand for up to 290 AFY of potable water. Water Supply Reliability - The majority of SFPUC water supplies are susceptible to drought conditions which could result in significant reductions in available water supply in dry years. The City's present water supplies are also vulnerable to service disruptions due to earthquakes and other such events. The Project would provide up to 290 AFY of locally produced drought-proof water supply. Wastewater Discharge - The City currently supplies Calpine with between 2 and 4 million gallons per day of treated wastewater with the remaining flow and its associated mass loadings of regulated consituents discharged to the San Francisco Bay. The Project would reduce discharges of secondary treated effluent and its associated constituents to the Bay. Resource Stewardship - Water supplies to the SFPUC regional water system result in diversions from the Tuolumne River which may impact flow conditions and the natural habitat within the river. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the Recycled Water Project is not constructed the City will remain 100 percent dependent on SFPUC water supplies as this supply faces increasing pressure and competition. The City's supply may also be impacted during drought and service disruptions due to earthquake and other catastrophic events. In addition the City will continue to discharge all of its treated effluent (except that portion used by Calpine) to San Francisco Bay which is listed as an impaired water body due to high levels of toxic substances in water and sediment. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) Water Supply - This project will provide water supply diversification and reliability. Hayward is currently dependent on SFPUC for 100% of the the City's water supply. While the City has no contractual cap on its water purchases the SFPUC has imposed an interim supply allocation at least through 2018. The Hayward Recycled Water Project has been developed to offset SFPUC purchases by up to 290 AFY. The project will supplement potable water demands and to the extent possible make drinking water quality supplies available for higher level purposes. Hayward's current supply is also vulnerable to drought conditions and service disruptions due to earthquakes. The Project would dampen the impact of reductions brought on by these occurrences and allow for the use of a reliable locally produced and drought-proof supply. ii. Water Quality Water Quality - The City currently discharges treated wastewater to San Francisco Bay in accordance with an NDPES permit. The use of recycled water would decrease mass loadings of regulated constituents to San Francisco Bay by reducing effluent flow. The discharge of secondary treated wastewater to the San Francisco Bay would be reduced by 290 AFY improving the water quality in this body of water. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management N/A iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) Resource Stewardship - The Hayward Recycled Water Project could reduce diversions from the Tuolumne River by 290 AFY an environmentally sensitive waterway benefiting the natural river habitat and improving the flow conditions.

","Project Type Description: This project will reduce sediment delivery to stream systems via rain and stormwater runoff and provide flood protection by attenuating runoff and reducing hydromodification. Implementation of LandSmart Plans will also improve upland and aquatic habitat and many of the practices recommended through the LandSmart program are consistent with actions necessary to adapt to climate change. ","Detailed description: Implementing natural resource conservation and management projects identified in LandSmart Farm Plans will improve water quality and wildlife habitat reduce stormwater runoff and hydromodification incorporate strategies consistent with climate change adaptation improve water use efficiency and assist landowners in the Sonoma Creek and Napa River watersheds to comply with adopted TMDLs and associated waivers of waste discharge. Through the LandSmart planning process land manager participants engage in a series of educational workshops and become familiar with resource concerns on their property and are provided with technical assistance to develop management practices to address the natural resource needs of their individual property. Once the LandSmart Plan is developed and appropriate management plans are identified the RCDs and other project partners work with the land manager to implement the practices and assist the landowner in identifying any on-going monitoring or maintenance needs required to sustain project benefits. In addition the RCDs in partnership with technical experts will offer assistance with project prioritization project oversight landowner communication and contractor oversight (when contractors are necessary for implementation). When appropriate RCDs will also offer educational workshops for landowners regarding best management practices and provide local youth and volunteer groups with opportunities to assist with restoration projects. Guidance in NRCS-EQIP program participation will be provided to assist with project costs. Project methods will include: 1. Prioritize projects in LandSmart plans by landowner interest sediment savings habitat benefit project cost permitting and feasability. 2. Identify a minimum of three multi-benefit projects in each of the three study watersheds for which to carry-out implementation. 3. Identify match funding possibilities for landowners including NRCS-EQIP County funds and landowner cost share. 4. Oversee final project planning permitting and implementation of projects including identifying volunteer student or community groups that may participate in implementation and receive environmental education. 5. Conduct at least one workshop per watershed focusing on water quality best management practices. ","Project Need: In 2009 the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) adopted a Basin Plan amendment establishing TMDLs for sediment in the Sonoma Creek and in the Napa River and an implementation plan to achieve TMDLs and related Habitat Enhancement goals for the two water bodies. The State Water Resources Control Board subsequently adopted the Basin Plan amendments in 2010. The Basin Plans were amended due to the decline of steelhead and salmon populations in the Napa River and Sonoma Creek as a result of high concentrations of fine sediment. Four significant categories of human-caused sediment sources have been identified: roads vineyards rangelands and channel incision/bank erosion. Subsequently the RWQCB has drafted waivers of Waste Discharge Requirements (Waiver) for vineyards and completed a Waiver for ranch properties. Ranch property owners and managers are currently completing farm plans to comply with the Ranch Waiver and those plans will be complete by November 2012. Southern Sonoma RCD Napa County RCD UC Cooperative Extension and NRCS are currently assisting grazing managers with completion of their Ranch Water Quality Plans. In order to comply with the Waiver for vineyards an eligible vineyard landowner/operator shall complete a comprehensive Vineyard Water Quality Farm Plan (Farm Plan) by March 31 2014. The LandSmart program assists vineyard and ranch managers with developing farm plans in compliance with the waivers. In both instances the resulting farm plans will identify specific water quality and habitat enhancement projects. The Farm Plans will be a comprehensive inventory and assessment of natural resources facility condition and management practices at a given property. The inventory and assessment is intended to assess and document existing management practices and guide a strategy for implementing additional management practices and projects that are designed to prevent the discharge of pollutants to surface waters. Management practices and implementation projects must address all potential sources of pollutants on the vineyard property including: road runoff and erosion surface erosion chemical and fertilizer applications excessive storm runoff and sediment delivery from sites such as gullies rills and landslides. The Farm Plan must also evaluate and identify opportunities to implement management practices and/or retrofit vineyard property drainage facilities to promote infiltration prevent increases in peak storm runoff and promote enhancement of multiple beneficial uses (including aquatic habitat) to meet all waiver standards. The proposed project will provide funding to assist landowners with implementing the management practices and projects identified in their LandSmart Farm Plans. At present the RCDs have funds to assist with farm assessment and planning but no funding assistance for implementing such work on private properties is limited. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If some level of public funding is not available to assist land managers with implementing expensive but pollution-reducing projects identified in their Farm Plans there is a risk that land managers will not have sufficient funding to implement projects in a timely manner to prevent sediment delivery and improve habitat. This will put aquatic habitat at risk of continued degradation over a more extended period of time. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality ...This project will improve quality by implementing sediment-delivery reducing projects identified in LandSmart Farm Plans for vineyards and ranches in the Napa River Sonoma Creek and Petaluma River watersheds. Typical projects include improvements to rural road systems that contribute fine sediment to waterways through chronic and episodic processes enhancement of riparian habitat and implementation of practices of treatments to control sediment delivery from rills gullies and landslides (when practical). Most if not all of these practices are carried out in a way that is sensitive to climate change and climate adaptation. iii.

"233 ","Miller Avenue Green Street Plan ","Over the last three years the City of Mill Valley has planned improvements for the community's main gateway Miller Avenue. The project plans to renovate the existing roadway originally constructed in the late 1800's with improved bicycle pedestrian and transit facilities for users of all ages and abilities. Miller Avenue will incorporate green street features including bio retention areas pervious pavement and creek day lighting designed to improve the quality of storm water runoff released to Corte Madera Creek Richardson Bay and San Francisco Bay. ","('North Bay';) | Marin County ","37.895841667 | -122.53817778 ","02/01/2013 ","05/01/2020 ","This project is located within the City of Mill Valley in Marin County. The extent of the improvement will be along Miller Avenue from Almonte Boulevard to Sunnyside Avenue. ","Project Type Description: This project will include several low impact development strategies including the construction of bio retention areas and pervious pavements capturing runoff from impervious surfaces. To facilitate future improvements to reduce the potential of flooding of Corte Madera Creek the project will relocate existing utilities including water storm drain sanitary sewer and electrical facilities. ","Detailed description: The project included in this grant application incorporates over 10 years of planning by City staff community members and other stakeholders. In the early 2000 s the Mill Valley community recognized the need to develop a plan to better balance the modes of transportation along Miller Avenue the community s principal arterial corridor. Following a series of studies to assess needs in 2009 the City Council assembled a Design Advisory Committee (DAC) to finalize a conceptual streetscape design for Miller Avenue. Through 2010 and 2011 the DAC worked to establish goals for Miller Avenue review technical data and coordinate public input. The outreach process included three public meetings to present concepts discuss tradeoffs and solicit input. Through this community based collaborative process the Miller Avenue streetscape plan identified the following goals: improve multi-modal transportation preserve and enhance ecology and landscape recognize cultural features and character and improve infrastructure. The City Council adopted the streetscape plan in July 2011. The streetscape plan will reconstruct Miller Avenue from Sunnyside Avenue to Almonte Boulevard adding continuous bicycle lanes and widening sidewalks. Recognizing that storm water runoff from Miller Avenue contributes to water quality in the Arroyo Corte Madera del Presidio; planners added the following elements to the project: Limit new impervious surfaces by reducing asphalt and concrete pavements and install pervious pavement where possible. The project s reduction in impervious surfaces reduces peak discharge to the watershed and improves ground water recharge.Install storm water best management practices such as bio retention facilities to intercept runoff from impervious surface removing pollutants prior to discharge to the watershed. The City plans to design and install these features in accordance with the Marin County's Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program. Experiment with alternative storm water quality features such as subterranean storm water quality blocks and evaluate their effectiveness by measuring influent and effluent. The City will employ these features in locations where pedestrian facilities are constrained by limited rights of way.Recognizing the history of flooding including the 2005/06 event along Miller Avenue and adjacent neighborhoods relocate existing utilities and provide basic infrastructure for improvements as identified in the Richardson Bay Watershed Work Plan currently being prepared by the County of Marin. Promote the importance of water quality by day lighting a portion of a tributary of Corte Madera Creek at Millwood Street. Remove invasive species from the creek. Due to the size of the project and potential to cause disruption the City will phase construction likely over a five year period and in coordination with the flood control project. ","Project Need: Miller Avenue currently has no facilities to remove pollutants from rainwater runoff to the Corte Madera Watershed. Runoff originates not only from the public street but from many of the private properties along the corridor. As this is one of the most dense portions of the community it represents a major contributor of non point source pollution originating from vehicle emissions and maintenance waste trash and pesticides. These pollutants are discharged directly to the San Francisco Bay. As defined in the Streetscape Plan the need to repair the corridor's basic infrastructure including pavement sidewalks and ramps and utility systems is great as the design life is exceeded. The City of Mill Valley has inadequate local funding to complete the project and is working to secure additional funds through a combination of sources including Transportation Authority of Marin Measure A sales tax and the State of California Safe Routes to School Program. These external funding sources prescribe how the funds can be expended precluding certain project features. The City of Mill Valley may not have adequate local funds to completely integrate storm water quality features into the improvements of Miller Avenue. Additional funding through the IRWMP program will assist the City in creating a green street that will serve as a model for other North Bay communities. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Miller Avenue will be re-constructed with as many of the elements defined in the Streetscape Plan as funding will allow. If funding is not received through the IRWMP program the City will integrate as many storm water best management practices as possible. However due to differed maintenance and competing requirements that are beyond the City's control a comprehensive storm water quality strategy many not be possible. ","Project Benefits: Flood and Storm Water Management In its current configuration Miller Avenue has 19.1 acres of impervious and 4.5 acres of pervious surfaces. When complete the street will be transformed to contain 17.5 acres of impervious and 6.1 acres of pervious surfaces. Approximately 1 acre of the project area will be reserved for storm water quality features limiting non source point pollution to the Corte Madera Watershed. As Mill Valley receives about 38 inches of rainfall a year about 60 AC-FT of currently untreated runoff will pass through a storm water quality feature when the project is complete. The second major benefit is the project will clear utilities and other obstructions to accommodate future flood control improvements identified by the County of Marin. The City and County have identified several alternative improvements which may include a bypass channel flap gates and/ or pump station. The City will coordinate the design of Miller Avenue with the flood control improvements. The third benefit is a section of creek will be day lighted and invasive species removed. The project will incorporate informational signage describing the importance of creeks and water quality. Finally when complete this project will serve as a model for other North Bay communities planning green street projects. The City will provide guidance related to balancing green and complete street components as well as solutions to challenges faced during construction. As the project begins operations the City will provide data related to maintenance and cost. While the total project cost is estimated to be $20 million storm water quality features represent about $1.8 million. ","  "," ","City of Mill Valley ","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1"

Martinez Reservoir is relatively shallow with moderate water clarity. In these conditions most algae grow well and can produce taste and odor producing compounds such as geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB). The persistence of taste and odor producing compounds creates a serious water quality problem for the City that cannot be overcome by conventional water treatment technologies or temporary use of alternative water supplies. In addition the Contra Costa Water District must treat the Martinez Reservoir using copper-based algaecides and other standard methods for treatment of MIB and geosmin. Minimizing applications of algaecides in the Martinez Reservoir is desirable for overall water quality as well as to reduce copper which can pass from the reservoir through other means such as industrial cooling water to the San Francisco Bay.

The project will improve habitat for salmonids reduce flooding in several locations and reduce flood-caused erosion in areas that have experience repeated roadway collapses. ","('North Bay';) | Marin County "," ","6/15/2014 ","10/15/2016 "," ","Project Type Description: Water quality and stormwater improvements are achieved by treatment of stormwater by infiltration through bio-swales and rain gardens. Groundwater recharge benefits are achieved by slowing and sinking run-off which aides to prolong instream flows longer into the summer months. Habitat for critically endangered salmon is achieved by improving water quality through infiltration and slowing down peak flows during high storm events by rain water storage. Flood protection is improved by slowing down peak flows through retention infiltration and storage of hihg flows during winter storm events and then releasing it back into the watershed during times of lower flows. ","Detailed description: The project will install green LID infrastructure elements (bio-swales rain gardens rain barrels erosion control structures etc.) at the Marin County Fire Dept. Headquarters (MCFDHQ) and three sites on private property in the San Geronimo Valley. The objective of the project is to reduce run-off of contaminants and erosion of sediment into a critical coho salmon stream. The projects will also help to reduce risks of flooding during peak storm flows. The projects have been identified as priorities in the San Geronimo Valley Landowner Assistance Program and address impacts related to the TMDL listing for this creek for sedimentation. As an educational benefit the project at the MCFDHQ will be showcased to the public at the annual 4th of July pancake breakfast. Members of the public will be recruited to participate in all projects and informed about the benefits of LID to the watershed Water quality improvements are achieved by filtration of run-off through bio-swales and rain gardens. Groundwater benefits are achieved by sinking stormwater run-off to recharge in-stream flows. Flood protection for residents in the valley is improved by slowing down peak flows through retention infiltration and storage of run-off during winter storm events and then releasing it back into the watershed during times of low flows. Green infrastructure projects on the HQ property The Marin County FD headquarters has approx. 1.6 acres of impervious surface. During storm events resulting runoff creates downstream erosion and habitat degradation. This community-based project integrates two main components upstream restoration and green infrastructure. Education and outreach will be built into each step of the project. The HQ has large roof areas and large impervious (asphalt) surfaces. A guiding principle of green infrastructure is to infiltrate water into the ground as close to its source as possible. In keeping with this approach a variety of LID strategies could be deployed at the HQ including large and small rain cisterns pervious roadway dry cells and raingardens. Because of the wide range of size and cost for each LID technique this project could be phased. Some components will require no design drawings and approvals. Others will. Since the HQ is County property all components have the benefit of requiring little or no County permits. The County would be the lead agency for CEQA purposes. Stream restoration of the Woodacre Creek tributary above the HQ The tributary overflows its culvert with every 5-10 year storm flooding into the HQ and Castle Rock Avenue. Adjacent to the point where the creek is culverted a  valley cut  across the roadway would channel any stormwaters (above the capacity of the restoration) into a raingarden. This raingarden is a project of the green infrastructure component of this proposal. ","Project Need: San Geronimo Creek and it's tributaries have been negatively impacted by urbanization in terms of water quality and water quantity. Run-off from impervious surfaces dimishes water quality and increased run-off in winter contributes to decreased flows in summer. Coho salmon are highly endangered in this watershed and improvements to water quality and water quantiy will aide in recovery of the population. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Stormwater run-off and contaminants will continue to wash from the Fire Station parking lot and from the roadway at the other three sites directly into the creek negatively impacting water quality. Increased storm run-off will continue to flush juvenile salmon downstream before they are ready and contribute to flooding and streambank failure in downstream reaches. ","Project Benefits: i.

The fine sediment TMDLs for Sonoma Creek and Napa River identify the FFF program as a recommended program for agricultural sites. ","Detailed description: Three watersheds in the North Bay- Sonoma Creek Napa River and Suisun Creek are primarily agricultural land and rangeland and support threatened steelhead trout. Both Sonoma Creek and the Napa River are listed as impaired by excessive fine sediment and pathogens. The Napa River is also listed as impaired for nutrients. The Suisun Creek Watershed Assessment and Enhancement Plan and 10 years of extensive water quality monitoring call for reducing fine sediment loading and water temperatures in Suisun Creek (Laurel Marcus and Associates 2004 California Sportfishing Protection Alliance 2011). The San Francisco Bay Basin Water Quality Control Plan shows the three waterways have the following beneficial uses: COLD MIGR RARE SPWN WILD REC-1 REC-2 Ownership in these three watersheds is more than 90% private land. The fine sediment TMDLs for Sonoma Creek and Napa River require a reduction in surface erosion associated with vineyards of 51% and grazing lands of 81%. In the Napa River drainage the TMDL requires a 51% reduction of fine sediment generated by road-related erosion a 51% reduction in sediment derived from channel erosion and a 51% reduction in sediment from human induced shallow landslides with a total annual sediment load reduction of 78000 metric tons. Proposed load reductions in the Sonoma Creek basin are even higher. Sediment is generated from numerous sources dispersed over each watershed and requires a cost effective and widespread solution. Similarly implementation of the pathogen TMDL requires changes in livestock management location of water sources and livestock concentration areas and increases in filter strips and riparian corridors. Addressing these pollution sources requires working closely with the managers of agricultural land and rangeland to foster widespread and long term implementation of management measures. The TMDLs in the Sonoma Creek and Napa River identify the FFF program as a means for implementing water quality improvements needed to reduce pollutant loading in the waterways and as a means of protecting beneficial uses primarily salmonid habitats. The Suisun Creek Watershed Plan recommends establishing the FFF program in the drainage as a tool to reduce fine sediment in Suisun Creek and its tributaries. This recognition comes from the comprehensive science-based approach the program uses to identify sediment sources and implement pollution prevention measures and stream habitat restoration and thus implement the State non-degradation policy for water quality. Recovery of threatened steelhead trout in these three watersheds and for the Napa River also Chinook salmon requires both improvement of water quality such as reduced fine sediment loading as well as creek and riparian corridor restoration water conservation and supply changes and reduced chemical use. A review of the potential to restore steelhead habitats in the SF Bay Area rated the Napa River Suisun Creek and Sonoma Creek basins amongst the top 5 watersheds (CEMAR 2007). With the level of private land ownership in these basins recovery of these fish species requires a high level of cooperation with growers and ranchers. This proposal would provide funding for the Fish Friendly Farming/ Fish Friendly Ranching (FFF/FFR) Environmental Certification Programs to be implemented on 25000 acres in three North Bay watersheds (Napa Sonoma and Suisun). The FFF/FFR program was designed to improve water quality and to restore and sustain habitat for the federally listed threatened Chinook salmon and steelhead trout. The FFF/FFR program is a voluntary certification program for farmers and ranchers who implement land management practices that restore and sustain fish habitat on their property and improve water quality. Landowners and managers enroll in the program attend 4 educational workshops on environmentally beneficial land management practices examine their property and develop a comprehensive farm/ranch plan with a FFF/FFR technical staff member and implement sediment reduction and ecological restoration projects. The FFF/FFR staff complete a comprehensive sediment source inventory on each site that includes roads vineyards/grazing areas service areas all sources of concentrated flow and all creeks. Legacy erosion sites are also identified. Chemical use is reviewed as are water supply facilities and water conservation measures. For each site identified a management measure is prescribed and then listed in the farm plan as a required action with a timeline for implementation. In addition to sediment and pathogens the FFF/FFR program focuses on habitat restoration along streams. The FFF/FFR program uses a geomorphic and ecological approach to stream restoration particularly incised alluvial creeks which are common in these watersheds. Creeks are assessed and measured to determine geomorphic features and any ecological concerns such as invasive non native plants lack of large wood and density and width of riparian canopy are noted. Restoration methods focus on setting back banks and widening riparian corridors to address the root cause of incision by reducing flow velocities and thus erosiveness while increasing floodplain area and complexity in the channel. We also review current management practices and work with the grower to eliminate those that are not conducive to natural processes such as clearing vegetation or large wood. The FFF/FFR program works cooperatively with growers and ranchers to achieve a different set of practices over the entire site so that natural features and water quality are sustained. The FFF/FFR program also works with owners to implement habitat restoration projects. Each farm/ranch plan includes a thorough mapping of each site the detailed inventory and assessment and a list of required actions. Certification is done by the three regulatory agencies: National Marine Fisheries Service San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board and the County Agricultural Commissioner. Implementation of the farm/ranch plan is then carried out and documented by annual photo monitoring and reporting. Recertification occurs on a 5 year basis and the farmer/rancher must demonstrate implementation of the required actions. Current Agricultural waivers for Napa River and Sonoma Creek proposed by the Regional Board require farm and ranch plans by nearly all landowners. These plans would cover the entire parcel the vineyard is on and require the same content that the FFF/FFR program already provides. The 501 c3 nonprofit organization the California Land Stewardship Institute (CLSI) runs the FFF/FFR program. The FFF program started in 1997 and was adapted for the Napa Valley in response to requests by the Napa Valley Vintners Association Napa County Farm Bureau Napa County Grapegrowers Association and the Sierra Club. In 2011 the program expanded to rangeland and with this addition can implement the management measures needed to significantly reduce pollutant loading over large areas of the Napa River Sonoma Creek and Suisun Creek watersheds. Currently over half of the vineyards parcels in the Napa River watershed are already enrolled in the FFF program totaling over 50000 acres with 4000 acres of vineyard parcels enrolled in the Sonoma Creek watershed and 2000 acres of vineyard and ranch parcels enrolled in the Suisun Creek watershed. In the Napa River watershed 90 miles of creek 18 miles of river and 256 miles of road have been assessed and had BMPs applied through the FFF program. In the Sonoma Creek watershed 8 miles of creek and 17 miles of road have been assessed and had BMPs applied through the FFF program. In the Suisun Creek watershed 7 miles of creek and over 9 miles of road have been assessed and had BMPs applied through the FFF program. For the 2004-2010period a detailed sediment reduction estimate was completed for sheet rill and gully erosion from roads vineyards and legacy erosion sites on certified FFF sites in Napa County. The implementation of management measures resulted in a source reduction of 4-6 tons/acre/year for 40951 acres of agricultural land. The FFF/FFR program identifies major projects and works to bring groups of landowners along creeks or river reaches together to work cooperatively to restore habitats. One example of this is the Oakville to Oak Knoll Napa River Restoration project which encompasses 9 miles of the Napa River. The FFF/FFR program recognizes that improved land stewardship is best accomplished through a cooperative and positive working relationship with landowners and farmers/ranchers. Landowners and managers make numerous decisions regarding land management and will use improved methods if encouraged and if technical and financial assistance is available for projects. ","Project Need: The Napa River Sonoma Creek and Suisun Creek watersheds support populations of federally listed threatened Chinook salmon and steelhead trout. In 1990 the State Water Board listed the Napa River as being impaired by excessive fine sediment. Fine sediment fills pools necessary for rearing and clogs gravels needed for spawning. Recovery of these listed species requires a reduction in fine sediment in these areas. The fine sediment TMDLs for the Napa River and Sonoma Creek identify vineyards grazing land roads and creeks on private land as primary sources of fine sediment and set reductions goals for each source. Individual sources in these watersheds are not identified but instead the sources are distributed throughout the drainage. To address improvements to water quality and TMDL implementation individual parcels have to be assessed and management measures applied to control erosion and sediment sources. The FFF/FFR program targets non-point sources of sediment in the three watersheds on private agricultural and ranching lands and applies BMPs to reduce erosion and associated sediment from entering the waterways. The TMDLs for the Napa River and Sonoma Creek identify the FFF program as a method for implementation of pollutant loading reduction and TMDL implementation. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Water quality improvements will not be implemented and instream and riparian habitat improvements will not occur. The FFF/FFR program is very popular with private landowners and is able to make significant changes to land management measures resulting in sustained environmental improvements. Currently there are no other programs of this type or scale in these watersheds. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) As part of every farm and ranch plan water supply facilities are inventoried and inspected. If a direct diversion is used then it must be fitted with a fish screen that is compliant with NMFS regulations. The amounts of water used for irrigation and frost control are reviewed and participants are required to apply BMPs to their water use including soil moisture testing prior to irrigation and use of non water alternatives for frost control if feasible. We also look at whether the water supply has a major effect on fish habitat and may recommend changes. This project would apply these management measures on 25000 acres of land. ii. Water Quality The FFF/FFR staff complete a comprehensive sediment source inventory on each site that includes roads vineyards/grazing areas service areas all sources of concentrated flow and all creeks. Legacy erosion sites are also identified. Chemical use is reviewed. For each site identified a management measure is prescribed and then listed in the farm plan as a required action with a timeline for implementation. The FFF/FFR program works cooperatively with growers and ranchers to achieve implementation of ecologically sound practices over the entire site so that natural features and water quality are sustained. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management All drainage systems on the property are mapped and evaluated for adequacy and erosion effects. To the extent possible infiltration of stormwater is a priority rather than installation of pipes and dispersal of water at concentrated flow outlets is required. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) In addition to sediment and pathogens the FFF/FFR program focuses on habitat restoration along streams. The FFF/FFR program uses a geomorphic and ecological approach to stream restoration particularly incised alluvial creeks which are common in these watersheds.

We also review current management practices and work with the grower to eliminate those that are not conducive to natural processes such as clearing vegetation or large wood. Through the FFF/FFR program numerous creek and river restoration projects are identified and CLSI seeks additional funding to implement these in collaboration with the owners.

The IRWMP will enhance EBMUD's ability to meet the needs of its 1.34 million business and residential customers by providing a reliable alterative recycled water supply that will conserve high quality potable water supplies. This project will help to offset demands for potable water by substituting recycled water for beneficial landscape commercial and industrial water uses currently served by EBMUD's supplies from the Mokelumne River which is a tributary to the Delta. During dry and critically dry years the project will reduce EBMUD diversion from the Mokelumne and/or Sacramento Rivers. By increasing the proportion of recycled water used EBMUD will be albe to save a larger percentage of its high quality potable water supplies for residentail and commercial potable uses thereby icreasing regional supply reliability. The project reduces wastewater discharges to San Francisco Bay by reusing wastewater that would otherwise be discharged to San Francisco from City of San Leandro's wastewater treatment plant. The project will reduce the amount of water that must otherwise be delivered from the Mokelumne River to EBMUD's service area. Reducing deliveries can result in higher reservoir storage levels in EBMUD reservoir in the Sierra Nevada foothills and increased reservoir releases to the lower Mokelumne River. Once that water reaches the Delta ut provides additional benefits for Delta resources ad water users. ","  "," ","East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) ","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1"

","Project Type Description: MMWD will be mapping critical water supply infrastructure along the shoreline which is vulnerable to sea level rise and shoreline erosion. Damaged infrastructure is vulnerable to breakage and impacts to water quality and safety. The proposed natural shoreline projects are intended to provide and protect salt marsh habitat including the endangered and listed plant Point Reyes Bird's Beak. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of natural approaches to combating wind-wave erosion under current and sea level rise conditions. Direct coastal flooding is a serious impact to the eastern Marin shoreline which has extensive infrastructure and population along shoreline areas very vulnerable to sea level rise. ","Detailed description: The proposed project will design and permit five different shoreline approaches projects within Richardson Bay that demonstrate the ability of constructed natural estuarine beach systems and marsh enhancement using dredged sediments to successfully inhibit wind-wave erosion and provide flood protection under current and anticipated sea level rise conditions. We have included implementation funding for one project called the Seminary Shoreline Project (project 2 below) to demonstrate the capability of these types of systems to protect critical infrastructure (in this case a roadway) from erosion undercutting of the roadway slope. The five proposed projects and their demonstration values are as follows: Project location Demonstration Value 1. Seminary Drive shoreline Tiburon Construction and monitoring of the effectiveness of a constructed estuarine gravel and cobble beach berm system abate wave erosion of unconsolidated road embankment fill that is currently eroding beneath an active roadway as an alternative to conventional boulder armoring that may have greater adverse environmental impacts. 2. Southeast Bothin Marsh shoreline Mill Valley Ability of a constructed narrow coarse-grained marsh-fringing estuarine beach slope (composed of fine gravel coarse sand and (native SF Bay) oyster shell hash) to protect a retreating wave-eroded salt marsh supporting special-status wildlife and plants where conventional shoreline stabilization would be incompatible with this habitat and likely infeasible for permitting. 3. Bayfront Park shorelines Mill Valley Protection of a wave-eroded salt marsh-fringed shoreline bordering frequently used pedestrian and bicycle trails in a public park using a constructed coarse-grained estuarine beach where conventional rock slope protection would conflict with shoreline access and existing recreational uses. micro-groins 3. Lower Coyote Creek/West Bothin Marsh Demonstrates the beneficial reuse of hydraulically placed dredge sediments to create high marsh habitat areas and increased shoreline flood protection in an existing marsh with listed species while emulating natural wetland structure and processes. This project also demonstrates methods to beneficially reuse dredged sediments to raise essential high marsh-upland transition zone habitats above rising sea levels. 2000 ft N 4 2 5 3 Few areas of SF Bay have as many people and critical infrastructure in low-lying areas unprotected by levees as Marin Baylands. In the Tam Junction area of within Richardson Bay there is occasional high tide flooding of roadways causingtraffic lane closures even in dry weather conditions. Sea level rise acceleration is expected to intensify tidal flooding frequency in tidal flood-prone bayland roadways and trails. Therefore the Marin Baylands can serve as an ideal test location for proof of concept for these types of projects that can inform shoreline erosion designs all around San Francisco Bay. This project aims to build upon a successful project in Eastern Marin (the Aramburu Island beach restoration project in Richardson Bay that aims to demonstrate the ability of estuarine beach systems to inhibit wind-wave erosion and adapt shorelines to rising sea levels. The ability of a natural beach system to resist erosion depends on matching the proper slope and grain size with the dominant wind-wave energy. A fully developed constructed beach profile can also include a sandy foreshore that dissipates wave energy through friction as well as a gravel/cobble beach and storm berm that adjusts in slope and elevation in response to the local wave energy. An outcome from this project is to provide engineering design guidance to the more traditional engineering design community to design these types of systems. The specific goals of the project are as follows:   Design and permit four projects and then construct at least one project of engineered shoreline improvement projects utilizing natural analogues of beach and estuarine marsh systems to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these systems to inhibit wind-wave erosion and provide flood protection under SLR conditions   Monitor and develop engineering design guidelines and proof of concept for the larger engineering design community to promote these types of engineered natural shoreline projects in areas where the proper design conditions (i.e. slopes and rock size match the dominant wind-wave energies).   Protect eroding salt marsh areas that contain sensitive habitats and multiple special-status species using methods and materials compatible with their conservation (i.e. alternative to armoring with rock) particularly where those marsh habitats are threatened by erosion and currently provide some level of shoreline protection   Demonstrate the beneficial reuse of dredge sediments (project 5 Lower Coyote Creek/Bothin Marsh) to reconstruct and enhance high marsh to maintain sustainable high tide flood refuge habitat and shoreline resilience as sea level rises. An additional element of this project will be mapping of critical drinking water infrastructure along the Richardson Bay shoreline by the Marin Municipal Water District (MMWD) and replacement of threatened infrastructure in critical locations threatened by sea level rise. This mapping task will delineate the location and elevation of critical drinking water pipes and allow the proposed shoreline protection alternatives to integrate with their infrastructure. ","Project Need: Few areas of SF Bay have as many people and critical infrastructure (i.e. water and wastewater treatment access roads community facilities) in low lying areas unprotected by levees as eastern Marin. In some locations within Richardson Bay there is roadway flooding and traffic lane closures even under current high tide conditions without any rain inputs. Unless we demonstrate alternatives to rock rip-rap and sea walls to protect eroding and flooded shorelines the public is going to demand these hard engineering solutions that have aesthetic and habitat impacts as valuable marsh and estuarine beach habitat is lost to shoreline engineering. The Aramburu Beach restoration project in Richardson Bay constructed in 2011 has provided a successful demonstration of natural beach system to protect shorelines under relatively high wave energies as compared with many of the 4 demonstration projects proposed here. This project will extend these concepts into more visible urban areas to provide a higher visibility and demonstration value to the public as well as to the engineering design community as to the effectiveness of these systems. MMWD will be coordinating the mapping and replacement of critical drinking water infrastructure in conjunction with the shoreline adaptation work under this grant application. MMWD provides drinking water to the residents of Marin County and some of their facilities are directly threatened by sea level rise and coastal erosion. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: There are large residential areas and associated infrastructure that will become more and more inundated as sea levels rise. There will be greater community demand for hardened engineering structures such as rock rip-rap and seawalls to protect the shoreline and community from flooding. There will be greater demand to armor the shoreline and the existing marsh habitat will be drowned out with an associated loss of habitat. Water supply will be compromised without planning for erosion and salt-water intrusion. Water quality and public safety could be compromised without planning. ","Project Benefits: i.

Further land subsidence is viewed to be a major concern of communities within the SEBP Basin (low lying area flooding is seen as major risk and land subsidence can elevate that risk). Also note that low lying areas within the SEBP Basin for the most part correspond to those regions identified as disadvantaged. ","Detailed description: The primary task associated with establishment of a subsidence monitoring network within the SEBP Groundwater Basin involves conducting an extensive field survey. That effort will also include the construction of survey monuments throughout the basin. Details of this work effort follow. A basin-wide GPS land survey will be conducted to establish reference datum for subsidence monitoring. The survey will cover the area from Bay Farm Island in Alameda to the City of Hayward. Such a survey will allow entities within the SEBP Basin to tie their individual groundwater monitoring wells together from an elevation perspective (and hence assure for consistency regarding water level readings subsidence monitoring etc.). Those wells which are already in place will be coupled with the construction of new survey monuments (permanent monuments) to measure land subsidence. EBMUD has an in-house surveying group that will be called upon to conduct this work. Key tasks of this project include: GPS field surveys monument construction office processing and production of a technical memorandum documenting well elevation data. The work assumes a 3 man crew in the field and a party chief / survey supervisor in the office processing the data and preparing a technical memorandum that will serve as a work-product \"document\" for this project. The reference datum will be used to establish a base line condition for tracking land surface changes from seismic movement as well as from the impacts (if any) of groundwater pumping on surface elevation and water levels. Having a single recent survey will assure that survey data collected by various entities (Cities Counties Agencies etc.) is of great accuracy /  quality . The Stakeholder group formed for the ongoing SEBP Basin GMP effort will be informed of the plans for the survey. Data derived will be used to update documentation and models prepared as part of the South East Bay Plain Basin Groundwater Management Plan (currently in development) and hence will be of use / of benefit to all stakeholder agencies (City of Hayward City of Oakland City of Alameda the Port of Oakland etc.). ","Project Need: Land Subsidence is of critical concern to agencies (such as the City of Alameda) that have land surfaces very close to the existing elevation of the San Francisco Bay. Even small changes in elevation can create added flood risk to residents. In the future it is expected that the South East Bay Plain Groundwater Basin will serve as an increasely used feature. EBMUD plans to utilize it to address water supply needs during times of drought. Likewise the City of Hayward envisions continued use of the Basin. Other entites such as the Port of Oakland and various golf courses with the region may rely more and more on water from said basin to address non-potable water supply needs. In order to prevent land subsidence from taking place within the Basin due to mismanagement it is important to have a detailed baseline survey with set benchmarks that various users can refer to as a reference. This project effort allows for a detailed baseline to be established. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If a detailed survey is not performed stakeholders would not have this particular tool in place to properly management the Basin to prevent land subsidence from occurring (due to Basin mis-management / overpumping).

In order to maximize benefits and efficiencies these efforts need to be considered within a larger integrated regional planning process that is designed with an eye toward applying new technologies and anticipating future requirements. SFEI s Green Infrastructure Initiative will address the following key question: What should wastewater stormwater and water reuse/recycling look like in 50 years in the Bay Area both in terms of what is necessary and what is feasible? SFEI will work with municipalities and the Regional Board on planning projects focused on stormwater wastewater and ecosystem restoration at a range of time horizons. Key outputs will include regional and sub-regional analyses of benefits (water quality water security water reuse flood protection and habitat) and associated costs with the goal of identifying optimal regional and sub-regional master plans.

Understanding the current and future trends for transitional zones between marshes and upland should help mitigate stormwater issues by improving flood protection planning and implementation. Our project is already guiding the restoration of upland transitions and the DSS will assist with prioritizing sites for restoration/protection. We propose to partner with USGS/USWFS to address key data gaps. Understanding the current and future trends for transitional zones between marshes and uplands will provide for a better undertanding of the needs for and benefits of a potential \"buffer\" for storm water events and anticipated sea level rise. Our project has been working in Alviso (USFWS Environmental Education Center) and East Palo Alto (Cooley Landing Park and Faber-Laumeister Tracts) for years and will continue to provide assistance free of charge to disadvantaged communities. ","Detailed description: Restoration of the tidal marsh ecosystem in San Francisco Bay is a regional priority for natural resources managers. The Bay Goals (2000) and USFWS  Tidal Marsh Ecosystem Recovery Plan both call for the protection and restoration of upland transitional (aka ecotone) habitats and the Recovery Plan in particular places a high priority on allowing for landward migration of marsh habitats onto bordering plains as sea level rises (i.e. climate change adaptation). However these documents do not fully describe transitional habitats quantify the amount needed to aid species of special concern while allowing for SLR nor prioritize specific sites for protection and restoration. Without an understanding of these habitats water resources projects also cannot adequately consider them during planning. We will provide the information needed to help planners consider both current and predicted needs of the tidal marsh ecosystem in designing their water resources projects. We will develop a GIS decision support tool and utilize it to identify and prioritize marsh-upland transitional habitats (aka ecotone) in order to assist land managers in protecting and restoring San Francisco Bay s tidal marsh ecosystem. We propose to take a strategic approach towards decision support accounting for the landward migration of the ecosystem in response to predicted sea level rise (SLR). The first phase will describe and characterize transitional habitats with an advisory committee of regional specialists. Utilizing the definition developed in the first phase the second phase will inventory and map the current (and potential historic) extent of these transitional habitats within the San Francisco Bay Estuary. Then utilizing the characterization developed in phase one the third phase will identify criteria to rank and prioritize sites for land managers based on both ecological needs and management goals. ","Project Need: Land managers currently lack a comprehensive understanding of the distribution extent and ecological integrity of important habitats (e.g. for species of special concern) contained within the open space they manage. This is due in part to missing data but can also be attributed to poor data access (i.e. unknown sources) or organization. We propose to fill these needs for the entire estuary by developing a decision support toolkit for tidal marsh-upland transitional habitats. We will utilize it to inventory characterize and prioritize these habitats to assist land managers restoring and protecting San Francisco Bay. We will help managers allocate limited resources on prioritization alternative/scenario evaluation and adaptive management which will include considerations for the influence of future climate change and land-use scenarios. This project will aid management decisions by utilizing SLR predictions to strategically prioritize conservation. It will address uncertainties by identifying and prioritizing transitional habitat locations that specifically allow habitats to adapt to predicted change. It is timely due to a current regional focus on the tidal marsh ecosystem including transitions. This project will help inform management at regional scales and provide a framework that could be utilized for the conservation and management of other habitats. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: (1) Obligate fauna utilize transition zones as high tide refugia and there is a current lack of information about the distribution of these habitats and their adequacy to meet this need. Without adequate information water resources planners and managers will be unable to fully account for these needs in their projects. (2) In the face of potential SLR without proactively identifying and managing transition zones the impact of SLR and storm water events might not be mitigated as effectively as possible by water resources planners and managers. The USFWS ecosystem recovery plan refers to this as \"Strategic Habitat Conservation\" and promotes it vigorously. (3) And there are dozens of rare threatened endangered extirpated and extinct plants (i.e. species of special concern) that once thrived in the transition zones that cannot be addressed without these habitats receiving adequate attention. Without the methods and materials required to actively manage these habitats they will remain impaired by weeds and not provide the functions and values needed by native transitional habitat plants or obligate tidal marsh fauna. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality Tidal marshes are known to provide water quality benefits so their conservation creation restoration and enhancement should provide some measure of this. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Our projects  primary nexus with water resources is floodwater management which often includes creating flood protection levees where sea level rise threatens infrastructure. We anticipate being able to provide enough information to help planners locate flood protection infrastructure in such a way as to avoid or at least minimize impacts to the tidal marsh ecosystem help them design levees that actually provide habitat value and climate change adaptation to the tidal marsh ecosystem and then provide them with detailed methods and materials for restoring appropriate plant communities on newly created upland transitional areas. The landscape wide mapping of existing and potential sites along the tidal marsh / upland interface will also assist in prioritizing sites that might also help mitigate the impacts of SLR. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The development of a Decision Support System (DSS) for the tidal marsh / upland transitional zones as well as our affiliated projects that fill data gaps and support habitat restoration implementation are to better inform resource stewardship of the tidal marsh ecosystem enhance habitat protection and restoration and mitigate the impacts of Sea Level Rise (SLR) on coastal communities. By providing decision support to managers making choices that may impact the tidal marsh ecosystem we will better enable them to consider these natural resources and make more informed decisions about their management. Our findings will be organized at the parcel level to allow for easier application to planning work and provide managers with a list of parcels that are a priority for tidal marsh ecosystem recovery. Better resource stewardship is possible when data is not only available but also provided in a manner that makes it easy for managers to interpret and utilize. The DSS will assist better decision making by synthesizing available (and newly collected) data and our knowledge into a set of easy to use tools. Primary among these will be a prioritized list of sites for protection and restoration. In addition we will provide more detailed maps of existing tidal marshes throughout the estuarine system. The biotic abiotic (incuding projected SLR) and socioeconomic datasets will be integrated into a set of maps to characterize (and then prioritize) tidal marshes in order to assess the relative quality of their upland transitional habitats. Other important characteristics include the topography adjacent to a tidal marsh what quantity of open space is available and the plant community currently occupying it as well as adjacent land uses to assess their impacts and sea level rise models to prepare for their predictions. Our partners will collect needed data on the use of upland transitions by species of special concern to better characterize their structure and function. These data will be compiled into GIS and used to assess upland transitional parcels through a parcel based model weighting the different habitat characteristics and potential threats (land use SLR etc). The model includes habitat metrics based on important habitat characteristics we ve identified through our work with many regional specialists. The metrics will be assigned importance values relative to one another such that once combined into an index score will allow for parcel rankings to be produced. Managers referring to our parcel rankings will be able to access the justification for the scoring through the GIS. Land managers will be able to assess the overall value of protection or restoration of given sites within the larger landscape wide prioritization assisting in identifying the most cost effectiverestoration sites.

","Detailed description: The proposed project will construct several habitat restoration projects which were selected as highest priorities by the San Geronimo Valley Landowner Assistance Program. The projects include large wood structures riparian corridor restoration bank stabilization and fish passage. The projects are multi-benefit in that they protect and restore critical coho salmon habitat and they protect homeowners from high flood flows and loss of property to erosion. The project will remove invasive riparian vegetation repair eroding and collapsing creek banks and install wood and boulder structures to create channel complexity. A barrier to salmon migration will be replaced with a fish friendly crossing and rock weirs will be installed to stabilize the channel and facilitate fish passage into the upper tributaries of San Geronimo Creek. The proposed projects includes a partnership with a local non-profit the San Geronimo Valley Planning Group who is the lead for the Landowners' Assistance Program (LAP) with local residents. The LAP works to develop projects to restore endangered coho habitat and improve water quality in the San Geronimo watershed. The projects were selected as highest priority for this program and will serve as a model of restoration to the 40+ landowner participants in the program and all other residents in the valley. ","Project Need: San Geronimo Creek in the Lagunitas watershed is listed for TMDLs for excessive temperature and sediment; causing impacts to cold water fisheries specifically endangered coho salmon and steelhead. Removal of invasive plants and restoration of the riparian zone is needed to improve stream temperatures and repair of eroding and collapsing stream banks is important to improve water quality both in Lagunitas Creek and downstream into Tomales Bay. Installation of large wood strutures will increase channel complexity and provide refugia for coho salmon during high flow events.

"247 ","San Francisco Groundwater Supply Project-Lake Merced and Golden Gate Park Central Well Stations ","The SFGW Project will provide a reliable local source of groundwater to supplement the San Francisco municipal water system. The Project consists of construction of six municipal-supply well stations and extraction of an annual average of up to four million gallons of water per day (mgd). The SFGW Project will: (1) expand and diversify the SFPUC s water supply portfolio to increase system reliability; (2) increase the use of local water supply sources; (3) reduce dependence on imported surface water; and (4) provide potable groundwater for emergency supply in the event of an earthquake or other major catastrophe. ","('West Bay';) | San Francisco ","37.7476519 | -122.498583 ","3/16/2015 ","12/31/2016  ","40th Ave. & Quintara St. San Francisco (West Sunset Playground) which is approximate center of project area ","Project Type Description: Will integrate project with other local water supply sources. Project will be operated sustainably and provide management framework for northern part of Westside Basin. More groundwater recharge from the project could be beneficial for sustainably managing northern part of the Westside Basin. ","Detailed description: The SFGW Project includes two primary components: (1) Construction of six groundwater well facilities including four new facilities in Phase 1 and the conversion of two existing irrigation well facilities in Golden Gate Park to potable groundwater well facilities in Phase 2. Each of these facilities will include a groundwater well and a pump station. Disinfection equipment will be included at two of the facilities. (2) Construction of a pipeline distribution system to connect five of the groundwater well facilities to Sunset Reservoir the largest municipal water-supply reservoir in San Francisco. The Lake Merced Well Station will connect directly to the Lake Merced Pump Station (which pumps water to both the Sunset and Sutro Reservoirs in San Francisco) and will not require additional off-site pipeline construction thus allowing this well station to be constructed on an accelerated schedule. The Golden Gate Park (GGP) Central Well Station will be completed within 6 months of the completion of the Lake Merced Well Station. This proposal is requesting funding assistance for the construction of the Lake Merced and Golden Gate Park Central Well Stations. Proposed Grant Request: $3.0 million. $3.9 million (57%) of total project cost of $6.9 million will be provided by SFPUC Water System Improvement Program (WSIP) bonds. While this project is a city-wide project that does not specifically target but is inclusive of disadvantaged communities within San Francisco the additional water supplies provided by this project will benefit these communities. This project is being implemented in conjunction with the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department and is supported by the City and County of San Francisco Board of Supervisors. This project supports many of the objectives in the California Water Plan the established goals in the City and County of San Francisco s Urban Water Management Plan and the SFPUC s Water System Improvement Program s Level of Service Goals for Water Supply. ","Project Need: SFPUC has committed to developing 10 mgd of either new sources of water supply or offsetting water demand in San Francisco by 2018. Meeting this commitment will allow SFPUC to meet the contractual water demands of its Hetch Hetcy Regional Water System (wholesale customers) and satisfy other goals of its Water System Improvement Program. The SF Groundwater Supply Project would help to achieve the 10 mgd goal by providing up to 4 mgd of local groundwater supply. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Less water supply would be available to San Francisco and possibly to SFPUC's Hetch Hetcy Regional Water System (wholesale) customers which could lead to more water rationing during drought conditions. ","Project Benefits: The SFGW Project will achieve multiple benefits including increasing water supply reliability and the delivery of safe drinking water increasing local water supply groundwater management and drinking water treatment and distribution. In addition as California is currently facing a severe drought this project will reduce reliance on local and imported water supplies thus helping to provide immediate and long-term drought relief. The SFGW Project s benefits include supplying an annual average of up to 4 mgd of local (San Francisco) groundwater which will offset the need to obtain this amount from the Hetch Hetchy Regional Water System. This local groundwater supply would diversify San Francisco's water supply sources and in turn would increase the reliability and allow more flexible operation of the water system. The Lake Merced Well Station will provide approximately 0.43 mgd of the Phase 1 total of 2.8 mgd. The GGP Central Well Station will provide approximately 1.33 mgd of the Phase 1 total of 2.8 mgd. The combined well stations will provide an annual average of approximately 1.8 mgd (64%) of the Phase 1 total of 2.8 mgd. The GGP Central Well Station is the highest capacity well in the SFGW Project. It is being constructed in collaboration with the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department. One of the primary purposes of this well is to serve as a backup irrigation supply for Golden Gate Park which would help avoid having to use treated municipal-supply water for irrigation use. This well will assure continued use of groundwater for irrigation use: (1) during peak demand periods for park irrigation; and (2) in the event that one of the other two Golden Gate Park irrigation wells is down for routine maintenance or repairs. The Project will also provide an emergency source of drinking water supply in San Francisco as two of the well stations have been designed to operate with portable electrical generators if necessary and with on-site disinfection.

There is no construction associated with this project. ","Project Type Description: ","Detailed description: The Bay Area's major water agencies which serve the needs of over 5.6 million residents and businesses are working together to jointly develop a regional brackish water desalination project (Bay Area Regional Desalination Project or BARDP) to improve the region s water supply reliability especially during droughts and emergencies. The five water agencies include Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District - Zone 7 (Zone 7 Water Agency) Contra Costa Water District (CCWD) East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) and Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD). These agencies are also working cooperatively to inter-connect their water systems with interties to increase the overall reliability of the regional water supply system. These projects when completed will not only improve the ability to sustain adequate water supply after catastrophic events such as earthquakes but also increase the ability for these agencies to develop and share water resources more efficiently and cost-effectively. A Feasibility Study (2007) identified three feasible Bay Area locations for a regional desalination project. A pilot test (2010) conducted at an eastern Contra Costa County site proved that desalination is technically feasible pending further development of institutional and other technical issues related to water rights water conveyance etc. Currently site-specific analysis is being conducted to evaluate the potential environmental effects of installing a brackish water desalination facility at the eastern Contra Costa County site. The potential environmental effects are associated with Delta water quality and supply brine discharge fisheries and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition hydraulic modeling is being conducted to determine how water from the facility could be conveyed throughout the region and at what cost. Storage options to maximize yield from the facility are also being evaluated. The results of the site-specific analysis will demonstrate (alternatively:  inform the identification of ) the key alternatives that may be available (appropriate?) to include in the project. The AAR would include the following specific analysis: Facility Operations: Facility operation alternatives would be developed to evaluate a range of potential effects on water supply water quality and fisheries. For example altering pumping rates and schedule could alter potential environmental effects. The AAR would also evaluate intake design alternatives based on the potential to reduce fisheries impacts. A suite of alternatives would also be developed to evaluate how the BARDP yield could be increased by using off-stream storage capacity in CCWD s Los Vaqueros Reservoir. Alternatives would be developed with various options and the associated cost estimates and benefits of each would be prepared and analyzed. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Reduction: The brackish water desalination facility will use energy for raw water conveyance treatment and distribution. Depending on the energy source each operational scenario has a certain GHG emissions potential. Alternatives would be developed to minimize the GHG emissions potential and cost estimates would be prepared for these alternatives. Alternatives could range from using fully renewable energy sources to the currently existing energy sources such as PG&E. Alternative Analysis: The objective of the alternatives analysis is to identify options that increase the cost-effectiveness of delivering the desalinated water to the region while balancing it with the social and environmental impacts to develop an appropriate project description for the Environmental Impact Review process. The alternatives would be presented in the form of a matrix developed with information from previous tasks and studies enabling comparison based on key financial environmental and social criteria. The evaluation would be similar to a cost-benefit analysis that would help the agencies in determining the key components of the project. ","Project Need: The Bay Area's major water agencies which serve the needs of over 5.6 million residents and businesses are working together to jointly develop a regional brackish water desalination project (Bay Area Regional Desalination Project or BARDP) to improve the region s water supply reliability especially during droughts and emergencies.

These projects when completed will not only improve the ability to sustain adequate water supply after catastrophic events such as earthquakes but also increase the ability for these agencies to develop and share water resources more efficiently and cost-effectively. An Alternative Analysis Report (AAR) is proposed for developing an environmentally and socially responsible and cost-effective regional brackish water desalination project to benefit the San Francisco Bay Area. The AAR would identify and develop a range of project alternatives available for addressing some of the key issues associated with the regional brackish water desalination project. These issues include potential effects on water supply water quality fisheries and greenhouse gas emissions. The AAR would then proceed to evaluate these alternatives based on financial environmental and social criteria. Once an alternatives matrix is developed the Bay Area water agencies would use it to develop the key features of a brackish water desalination project that would be subject to more detailed environmental review and analysis.

","Detailed description: The Marin RCD will collaborate with local ranchers Southern Sonoma County RCD Marin Agricultural Land Trust the University of California Cooperative Extension Service (UCCE) and USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to implement local and regional watershed plans. We will build upon our demonstrated experience on grazing lands and water quality research to implement a three-year program to improve water quality. Fifteen projects will be implemented representing 20-30 environmental Best Management Practices on agricultural lands in Marin and Sonoma counties through the Conserving Our Watersheds (COW) program. The program goal will be implemented by providing ranchers with: 1) ranch/project planning and permitting assistance; 2) technical/engineering expertise; 3) construction contractors; and 4) maintenance and monitoring assistance. The BMPs/conservation practices to be implemented will be guided by a multi-agency technical advisory committee and are pre-approved by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA 2006) abide by California Department of Fish and Game s California Salmonid Stream Habitat Restoration Manual and are illustrated in MRCD s Groundwork: A Handbook for Erosion Control in North Coastal California. The practices were previously edited and approved in a public CEQA process for the Marin Coastal Permit Coordination Program (MCPCP) exclusively tailored to meet grazing lands conservation priorities. Seventeen types of NRCS conservation and restoration practices are intended for grazing lands to reduce erosion enhance aquatic and terrestrial habitat and assist ranchers with sound stewardship in our watersheds. These practices include access roads animal trails & walkways critical area plantings filter strips fish stream improvements grade stabilization structures grassed waterways lined waterways pipelines sediment basins spring developments stream channel stabilization structures for water control underground outlets and water & sediment basins. Project success will be evaluated using the Marin RCD Riparian Zone Monitoring Plan. ","Project Need: The North Bay is an important coastal resource of international significance harboring a rich variety of endemic plant and animal species including federally listed species such as coho salmon steelhead trout CA freshwater shrimp and CA red-legged frog. The project area targets: 1) watersheds identified by the USFWS Recovery Plan for the CA Freshwater Shrimp 2) watersheds identified by the DFG Implementation Schedule for the CA Central Coast for salmon and steelhead including the Lagunitas Creek watershed which boasts 16% of the State s remaining coho population and 3) areas of sensitive Critical Habitat for the CA Red legged frog. In addition one watershed is: 1) located in the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary 2) adjacent to the Bird Rock Area of Biological Significance and 3) includes three critical coastal areas (Lagunitas Creek Walker Creek and Tomales Bay). The Tomales Bay watershed has experienced water quality violations in shellfish growing areas. In September 2005 the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) approved the Pathogen TMDL for the Tomales Bay and the Conditional Grazing Waiver in 2008 which requires the implementation of Best Management Practices on agricultural lands. Neighboring agricultural lands in nearby watersheds have received very little attention in the past two decades. The San Antonio Creek watershed has yet to roll out an implementation program and properties in the Novato Creek watershed have not seen a focused implementation program since the 1980s. All watersheds have experienced a reduction in the quality and quantity of in-stream habitat and water supplies capable of fully supporting wildlife and anadromous fish populations due to increased fragmentation sedimentation water temperature nutrients and pathogens in water courses. Erosion and fine sedimentation are pervasive throughout the watersheds. In addition agricultural producers have identified lack of water as a primary issue in recent planning efforts. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The proposal will provide multiple watershed enhancement benefits to Marin and Sonoma County watersheds. If implementation did not occur ranchers and farmers would be at a loss to efficiently use their agricultural operations in ways that would conserve and protect our valuable natural resources. Critical areas of concern related to 1) agricultural sustainability 2) natural resources and 3) rural community quality of life would not be addressed properly. As a result watershed enhancements would not occur causing increased non-point source pollutants increased soil erosion lost opportunity for water conservation on agricultural land loss of additional enhancement to riparian corridors and ecosystem/fisheries restoration. Impacts would be realized by the following: Decline of coho salmon steelead trout CA red-legged frog CA freshwater shrimpDecreased instream flows for recreation and water consumptionIncreased closures for shellfish growing areasIncreased drought conditionsDrop in small family farms and agricultural acreage ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality ... iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) ..The intent and purpose of the grant is to assist the agricultural community in Marin County and a portion of Sonoma County s watershed based on watersheds plans and to implement efficient sustainable land management practices through conservation of natural resources. The proposed program is a well-coordinated collaborative methodical process that will deliver quality watershed improvements through a facilitated planning process which has been modeled after past programs in the district. The successes of past projects have shown to be beneficial to the residential and agricultural community as well as the wildlife communities that rely heavily on the resources within the watersheds. The COW project and collaborating partners are dedicated to our goals of constructing management practices providing long term benefits to ranchers residents tourists and recreational users of nearby beaches bays and estuaries. The Tomales Bay watershed in particular is an important coastal resource of statewide significance harboring a rich variety of endemic plant and animal species including federally listed species such as coho salmon steelhead trout CA freshwater shrimp and CA red-legged frog. The watershed is: 1) located in the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary 2) adjacent to one Area of Biological Significance and 3) includes three critical coastal areas (Lagunitas Creek Walker Creek Tomales Bay). Tomales Bay is used by boaters kayakers fisherman and enjoyed by beach lovers. The COW project will assist ranchers by implementing ranch water quality plans that specifically outline construction priorities and schedules by completing 20-30 management measures. Projects will focus on reducing sediment and associated nutrients and microbial contamination implementing efficient water conservation use promoting the removal of invasive and non-native species and enhancing riparian corridors. Projects will include but are not limited to streambank protection projects that stabilize eroding banks gully repairs that halt downcutting and advancement of upstream erosion and vegetative filter strip installation that filters runoff and traps sediment and other pollutants and installation of sheet flow ponds. Progress will be monitored to calculate estimates of the level of pollutant retention achieved at sites to indicate individual management measure and overall project effectiveness. We will also rely on other watershed monitoring efforts currently being conducted by partner agencies and organizations such as the Tomales Bay Watershed Council and RWQCB to guide our efforts. Random sites will be selected and intensively monitored to quantify management practice effectiveness in detail according to the Marin RCD Riparian Zone Monitoring Plan. Management practices are predicted to result in a 60-90% reduction in pathogen loading 50-75% reduction in fine sediment delivery from riparian fencing and revegetation projects and 75-95% reduction from headcuts gullies and streambank repairs. The resulting quantity of sediment nutrients and microbial pollution that the management measures and program reduce or retain will be dependent upon the total number of management measures implemented and the conditions of each site at the measures are implemented. Additionally it is expected ranchers will individually pursue implementation and monitoring of practices outside the program to meet ranch planning requirements and report annual progress to the RWQCB. Precautions will be taken to limit temporary negative impacts to stream channels where construction of biotechnical streambank stream channel stabilization and fisheries enhancement practices will occur. In stream projects may have a temporary risk to water quality however all projects will comply with CEQA and permit requirements which will minimize risks. For example qualified biologists will be on hand to supervise contractors and any necessary dewatering of sensitive stream areas. Each practice identified in the Marin Coastal Permit Coordination Program CEQA document contains a set of conditions which have been reviewed by local environmental groups and public permitting agencies. The conditions are written into permit documents and are provided to contractors to ensure compliance during the construction period. The project also offers additional benefits in the area of cutting edge carbon sequestration research. The Marin RCD in collaboration with the Marin Agricultural Land Trust University of CA Cooperative Extension Service Marin Organic USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and UC Berkeley are currently conducting carbon sequestration research associated with the implementation of agricultural management and restoration practices at 36 rangeland sites across Marin. The projects funded by COW II will further extend monitoring research into riparian areas. ","  "," ","Marin Resource Conservation District ","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0"

"251 ","Sediment Management Plan for the Gravel Creek Watershed ","The Sediment Management Plan includes passive elimination of an existing sediment pond and restoration of the pre-1968 pre-diversion Gravel Creek channel alignment and can be expected to improve water quality and instream habitat along lower Gravel and Olema Creeks. ","('North Bay';) | Marin ","38.03278 | -122.79037 "," "," ","Gravel Creek at Vedanta Society Retreat Center Olema CA ","Project Type Description: ","Detailed description: The nonprofit Vedanta Society of San Francisco (VSSF) has maintained an exisiting instream sedimentation pond on an unanmed tributary of Olema Creek referred to as Gravel Creek since taking ownership of their Vedanta Retreat property in Olema in the late 1960's. Implementation of periodic dredgings of the pond was contingent on the issuance of permits regulating such activity from the County of Marin Department of Public Works (DPW) the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) and the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). Preparation of a Sediment Management Plan was mandated by the County of Marin as a condition of the permit issued by the County for the on-site pond dredging conducted in November 2008. The permitting agencies had made clear their desire to end the practice of dredging the existing instream pond on the on-site tributary to Olema Creek due to the resulting environmental and biotic impacts. Clearwater Hydrology completed the \"Draft Sediment Management Plan for the Gravel Creek Watershed Vedanta Retreat Olema CA\" (SMP) in February 2011. The SMP for Gravel Creek was developed with the aim of providing for the low-cost geomorphically compatible removal of the existing on-stream sediment retention basin. As conceived the SMP will comply with the directive issued by Marin County to retire the existing sediment pond while providing for a reconnection of upper Gravel Creek with its approximate historical (pre-1968) alignment and its former floodplain. The SMP will also both minimize the extent and severity of construction disturbance to wetland habitat and enhance the potential for eventual anadromous fish access to Gravel Creek. Finally it will maintain or reduce the present flood risk to the Vedanta dwellings and outbuildings. ","Project Need: Significant water quality concerns for Olema Creek stem from its designation as habitat for the federally listed species including coho salmon steelhead trout California freshwater shrimp and the California red-legged frog. Due to its support of viable populations of the coho salmon and steelhead water quality objectives for Olema Creek and its tributaries are the referenced cold water criteria as defined by the RWQCB. The 303 (d) List of Impaired Waters maintained by the RWQCB lists Lagunitas Creek (including Olema Creek) as impaired by nutrients fecal coliform and sediment. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: While the existing sediment pond traps the majority of gravels finer material stays in suspension and is carried with the floodwater into the diversion ditch where it continues downstream along with decaying organic matter and fine sediment eroded from the banks of the ditch. Lower Gravel Creek has been subjected to heightened bed and bank scour due to the mining of gravel from the system via the sediment pond. Since a stream has a certain capacity to transport sediment at a particular discharge the lack of sediment supplied to the reach during the diversion period resulted in an increased tendency toward scour within the reach. The existing sediment pond and associated channel instability in lower Gravel Creek results in increased fine sediment loading to the Creek along this lower reach and increased quantities of fines delivered to Olema Creek. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality ...Returning the mainstem Gravel Creek channel to its pre-1968 alignment will eliminate the short circuiting discharge of floodwater through the sediment pond. While the pond traps the majority of gravels finer material stays in suspension and is carried with the floodwater into the diversion ditch where it continues downstream along with decaying organic matter and fine sediment eroded from the banks of the ditch. Lower concentrations of fine suspended material in Gravel Creek flow will decrease turbidity and coliform bacteria (vegetation derived) and increase dissolved oxygen content (DO).Rerouted channel flows will in the short- to mid-term incur significant new sedimentation in the current wetlands burying much of the fine decaying plant matter. After sedimentation has progressed mildly sloping floodplains will form that provide positive drainage and reduce the extent of backwater ponding. These floodplains will likely support a mix of wetland and other riparian plants (e.g. willows alder) that will reduce the area under a perennially saturated condition decreasing anerobic decay and its resulting odors.Rerouted channel flows will progressively form a stable channel through the lowlands. The re-formed channel will develop through the wetland and its gravel bed will reduce the frequency of contact of in-channel flow with any overbank wetlands especially once the sedimentation process begins to rebuild and reclaim its alluvial floodplain. Maintenance of an alluvial bankfull channel free of decaying wetland vegetation will reduce the suspended solid load and turbidity of the channel flows as well as dilute any coliform concentrations therein.The retirement of the sediment pond and the near elimination in flows conveyed in the diversion ditch will restore a balance to the sediment storage and management functions of the Gravel Creek channel and its floodplains. In addition this balance will affect the scouring capability of floodflows along lower Gravel Creek. This portion of Gravel Creek has been subjected to heightened bed and bank scour due to the mining of gravel from the system via the sediment pond. Since a stream has a certain capacity to transport sediment at a particular discharge the lack of sediment supplied to the reach during the diversion period resulted in an increased tendency toward scour within the reach. This tendency is most obvious in channel reaches downstream of large reservoirs where severe channel incision bank erosion and other bed instabilities can extend a more or downstream from the reservoir outlet. Less on-site channel instability will result in reduced fine sediment loading to the Creek along this lower reach and reduce the quantities of fines delivered to Olema Creek. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) ...Passive retirement of the existing sediment pond will eliminate future maintenance dredging on Gravel Creek. Past dredging activity while mitigated to the extent possible likely resulted in increased short-term delivery of fine sediments to the diversion ditch for later transport downstream to Olema Creek. Gravel Creek is one of the tributaries draining Inverness Ridge that supply critical summer base flow to Olema Creek. With adequate access the riffle-dominated reaches of Gravel Creek harbor potential rearing habitat for steelhead trout. Thus the retirement of both the instream sediment pond and the (further) upstream culvert crossing as well as the relocation of the cross-valley channel crossing and the installation of a more fish-friendly arch culvert would eliminate two significant barriers to steelhead. Other barriers may remain within the Vedanta lands however incremental progress toward the goal of enhancing habitat for this threatened species would be a significant benefit of the SMP.

"253 ","Implementation of the Napa River Watershed Assessment Framework ","The community is coming together to begin implementing or proposing new remediation projects to improve the Napa River watershed. But how do they know whether these programs are working? If they are not effective and even if they are how can watershed managers make them better? And finally how can leaders make intelligent choices about which promising programs are working best in the watershed over the long-term? A set of indicators for the watershed is required that links the structural and functional units of the system together and informs managers regarding applied remediation outcomes. This project will implement the results of the Department of Water Resources and Bay Delta Program - supported 2010 Napa River Watershed Assessment Framework (WAF) pilot study that was guided by multiple watershed goals integrated resource management strategies and involved the input and guidance from a number of local and regional agencies and community groups. Implementing recommendations set forth in the 2010 WAF pilot study includes peer review and additional stakeholder input on indicators of watershed health development of a watershed monitoring strategy/program for obtaining indicator metrics establishment of a central database and trend projections protocol and dissemination of a watershed annual Report Card. The Report Card allows watershed residents and managers to readily assess the condition of the watershed see trends or changes in those conditions over time and take action to achieve desired improvements (i.e. watershed goals) through adaptive management. In addition to implanting the WAF in the Napa River watershed this project will develop a Watershed Sustainability Index (WSI) that will be integrated with the WAF to provide watershed stewards a dynamic science-based measure of information on the status and trends of a watershed s ecological social and economic features as well as system changes from existing pressures and policy responses. The project is a public and private venture that will rely on strategic partnerships and multiple agency coordination to leverage all available resources and best available science with a mutual goal of establishing an efficient and effective monitoring program and database that provide for meaningful indicators of watershed health for the Napa River watershed based on stakeholder input and critical peer review. ","('North Bay';) | Napa; Solano ","38.082402 | - 122.232477 ","January 1 2013 ","December 31 2014 ","The Napa River watershed is the largest watershed in the North San Francisco Bay area (418 square miles) draining Napa Valley southward to San Pablo Bay. The Napa River acts as a central trunk stream collecting tributaries from the hills and canyons to the west and east that descend to the Napa Valley floor. Highest point in the watershed is found at the northern watershed boundary of Mount St. Helena (4344 feet elevation) which is also the highest peak in the Bay Area. The river supports the highest diversity and abundance of native fish populations and is regarded as a key watershed in the San Francisco Bay system. ","Project Type Description: Water Quality: The project provides for expanded monitoring and the collection of data that informs the water quality of the Napa River watershed. Monitoring activities will provide information on changes to water quality overtime and location for the Napa River (and select tributaries) which will illustrate special and seasonal trends in water quality in order to guide further management actions. Groundwater Benefits: The project will expand the state of knowledge of the Main Napa Valley Miliken-Sarco-Tulucay Jameson/American Canyon and Carneros groundwater basins through increased monitoring of indicators. Groundwater is a major component of the water supply for users within the Napa River watershed including agriculture and rural residents. It is important that local decision-makers and community members have knowledge of the status of groundwater level trends within the watershed as measured by select indicators in order to know when withdrawal is exceeding recharge rate and capacity. Habitat Protection & Restoration: The project will provide metrics such as riparian vegetation cover and other such indicators that quantify the various habitats of the Napa River watershed. Indicators related to habitat can inform managers of needed actions when the trends in indicators point to problems with habitat health. Indicators also provide valuable information on the success of restoration efforts by quantifying beneficial effects. Flood Protection: The Napa River watershed has long experienced problems with flooding. Potential data collection and related indicators could prove valuable to land managers in the watershed as considerations are made regarding alternatives to manage flood waters and minimize flood damage. Related to Disadvantaged Community: A significant number of people fish in the Napa River. Many are from low-income Hispanic populations in the watershed and the fish might provide their only family meal. Data collection and indicators will inform watershed managers regarding potential human health risks of eating fish from the River and the health of those fish populations related to fishing pressure they experience from humans. The project will assure that all sectors of the community are included in determining goals of the watershed. This will provide disadvantaged persons the opportunity to have their voices heard and their ideals for watershed stewardship incorporated into the assessment. ","Detailed description: The community is coming together to begin implementing or proposing new remediation projects to improve the Napa River watershed. But how do they know whether these programs are working? If they are not effective and even if they are how can watershed managers make them better? And finally how can leaders make intelligent choices about which promising programs are working best in the watershed over the long-term? A set of indicators for the watershed is required that links the structural and functional units of the system together and informs managers regarding applied remediation outcomes. The 2010 Napa River WAF and the implementation of its recommendations through this project recognize that the community needs more and better data and deeper analysis to understand the health of its watershed relative to established goals. To more accurately predict changes and take proactive adaptive management steps it is essential to regularly monitor indicators that reflect water quantity and quality directly and indirectly. Many basic conditions such as the state of the streams during the driest time of year the water use efficiency of residents and businesses the state of the local fisheries   cannot be tracked clearly (i.e. with great confidence) until watershed indicator monitoring efforts are increased and improved. This project consists of conducting peer review of the indicator report from the 2010 WAF and securing concurrence on interpretation and recommendations; sharing the results from the project with public stakeholder groups to obtain feedback on the appropriateness of the indicators and targets selected; reviewing all targets and scoring to verify that they mean the same level of watershed health across all indicators; designing/implementing a monitoring strategy for data collection on key indicators; and establishing a centralized database to track indicators conduct analysis and develop/publish a watershed Report Card over the long-term. Peer Review and Stakeholder Input on Indicators Consistent with WAF recommendations this project will assure that the results of the 2010 pilot study are further reviewed by a Technical Review Committee and watershed stakeholders to refine the approach and ensure the community s goals are accurately represented and tracked. At the start of the project a number of diverse experts will be asked to serve on a Technical Review Committee that will oversee the development of the monitoring and indicator program. Public engagement workshops and presentations will be designed and facilitated for interested citizens stakeholders in the Napa River watershed can review the WAF process and Report Card information from 2010 verify the appropriateness of goals objectives criteria and indicators selected and identify gaps that need to be fulfilled. Widely accepted group dynamic facilitator techniques (e.g. technology of participation pattern mapping open space technology world caf  etc.) will be employed for these steps. Design/Implement Monitoring Program Data are already being collected on various indicators in the watershed such as impervious surface amounts migrating fish populations access to public open space habitat fragmentation and connectivity aquatic biota groundwater stream temperature carbon storage and net primary productivity. Engagement with state and local agencies special districts will be done to integrate and coordinate the sources for different monitoring data of the Napa River watershed that have been identified as indicators of watershed health (such as the CA DWR CDFG Napa County Department of Planning Building and Environmental Services Napa County Public Works the Napa County Health Department etc.). Consultation with these agencies and other responsible entities will allow for the development of an effective and efficient monitoring program to support the Report Card work. Project implementation will rely upon establishing expanded organizational involvement to further refine current and future metrics and monitoring to inform additional indicators identified through the public engagement process. The project s monitoring program will build upon existing data latest available technology and best available science to achieve a robust range of relevant metrics. Database/Analysis There are a number of entities that collect data and report on various conditions of the Napa River watershed. The project will establish protocol and reporting specification to collectively assemble all available data being monitored that informs the health of the watershed. Data metrics and indicator measures will be compiled in a centralized database. The database will ease analysis and trend reporting by creating a centralized platform for all collected data. Report Card/WSI/Trend Analysis An annual Report Card will be produced that relates the status of the Napa River watershed relative to established goals and the previous cycle reporting condition. Data metrics and indicator measures will be compiled in a centralized database that leverages a number of already existing data compilations on the watershed as well as those planned to be implemented soon. Standard statistical analyses will be used to search for data patterns. The Technical Committee will be convened to review the monitoring program design and indicator dissemination through the Report Card. The Report Card will be printed annually in local and regional newspapers published on the Web and disseminated through a County of Napa mailing list. In implementing the WAF through the public verification process and conducting a monitoring program to support Report Card dissemination the project scope will also have collected sufficient data in order to develop a Watershed Sustainability Index (WSI) that presents a simple and timely picture of watershed sustainability. An index is an aggregate of indicators (or proxy) where the index illustrates in one measure the status of combined metrics that measure ecological social and economic data independently. A WSI can provide a much needed measure for organizations to assess the sustainability of the watershed not only creating a temporal and/or spatial comparison framework but also a means of identifying bottlenecks to achieving overall basin health. The project will develop an integrated dynamic science-based index that identifies the status and trends of the Napa River watershed s hydrologic environmental economic social and cultural features as well as changes from existing pressures and policy responses. ","Project Need: The overall need of the project is to engage the community to proactively monitor and assess the health of the Napa River watershed in order to identify performance relative to community goals and management actions. The 2010 Napa River WAF pilot study identified the pressing need to broaden the level of understanding on the health and function of the Napa River watershed. The 2010 WAF initiated an effort to identify the goals of the community select key indicators and develop a Report Card that scored the health of the Napa River watershed. There is a need for this project to pick up where the 2010 Napa River WAF left off by conducting peer review of the WAF process and approach validating assumptions identifying and expanding monitoring reviewing and securing concurrence on indicator reliability and establishing a routine reporting of watershed health. The multiple stakeholders within the watershed represent a wide range of preferences and ideals for the use and function of the Napa River. Integrating stakeholder objectives into common goals for the watershed is a pressing need. This will allow the community to jointly identify and prioritize the goals of the watershed and begin to work towards realizing their objectives. It will also empower citizens of the watershed to seek more secure funding that supports continued improvement and protection efforts of the watershed. The scientific data available through monitoring and other metrics that inform managers regarding the health of the Napa River watershed is insufficient to provide a meaningful assessment of the various indicators of health. Identifying the most effective and informative metric/indicators and collecting these metrics through routine monitoring within the Napa River watershed is another need and will provide the scientific basis for which meaningful assessments of Napa River watershed health can be made. These indicators might include: water quality issues such as nutrient sediment erosion toxins and biological oxygen demand (BOD); water supply issues such as municipal demands and supply sources agricultural irrigation needs and navigation; water resource stewardship issues such as habitat restoration fish migration and flood mitigation; and socio-economic issues such as disadvantage community nutrition recreation and property values. There is no single agency that is responsible for monitoring and reporting on the overall health of the Napa River and its watershed. Various data sources are collected by a number of different agencies and entities. There is a need to establish a centralized database to store collect and query scientific data related to the health of the Napa River watershed. Such a database would provide a reliable and accessible record of watershed conditions and identify trends in watershed health that would be described by the proposed basin-wide Report Card. Some of the types of critical questions that can be answered by the integrated assessment process that creates the Report Card could include the following. The watershed is listed as impaired under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act for nutrients pathogens and sediment. Sediment impairment impacts river gravels and degrades salmonid habitat. Some of the sources of pollutants identified by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board include non-point source pollution from municipal storm water agriculture (including grazing and vineyard operations) rural roads and open spaces and incision of the main stem of the Napa River. Point sources of poor water quality in the watershed include industrial plants wastewater facilities and landfills. A most important question to be addressed by the Report Card will be changes in patterns of pollutants in the watershed over time and whether landshed remediation including adoption of best management practices is making a difference in water quality. The Napa River watershed has long faced problems from flooding due to its many tributaries draining steep side valley canyons. Agricultural developments and other land conversions in the floodplain including draining and diking of the valley floor further reduces flood management capacity as well as affecting biological diversity and backwater and slough habitats. Report Card indicators that address measures of and changes in flood control capacity in the basin will be extremely important to managers in guiding their moving forward with planning further expensive remediation to prevent severe flooding. Present efforts by several Napa River watershed responsible agencies are focused on measuring the population dynamics of anadromous fish such as salmon using the Napa River for spawning. Not only will any Report Card indicators asking questions specifically about fish migration rates be important to these efforts but indicators for suspended sediments stream water temperatures and gravel permeability which are limiting factors for salmonid populations will further the understanding of providing improved habitat for salmonid spawning in the River. Indicators that provide metrics on fish migration patterns will help to identify area of concern. Fish passage barriers limit migration of anadromous fish but the project will help to discern the most effective location to mitigate through fish ladder or barrier removal projects. Human development within the watershed and groundwater extraction has resulted in hydro-modification and a lowering of the groundwater level. This coupled with stream flow diversion has affected aquatic and riparian habitats that are dependent on groundwater sources. The importance of a Report Card indicator questioning groundwater issues becomes paramount when so much of the agriculture in the Napa River watershed as well as domestic supplies relies upon groundwater pumping. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Lack of community involvement in identifying the goals of the Napa River watershed would result in apathy towards the health of the system. A critical mass of public engagement is essential in assuring that the diverse interests of stakeholders are identified considered and incorporated into the overall approach. The Napa River watershed community must be responsible for selecting the goals of the watershed. A participatory holistic and inclusive planning process that leads to positive concrete changes in communities lends credibility to a project initiative helps to gain further support and funding provides strength for action or political pressure blocks passive sabotage and creates community ownership of and responsibility for dealing with the issues of concern. Inhibit or restrict managers/agencies from making informed policy decisions about watershed programs. There is not at present an easily understood and accepted process that can be used to track the effectiveness of watershed improvement activities in an integrated fashion. There are a diverse array of agencies/stakeholders pursuing multiple objectives in the Napa River watershed through modifications to water supply infrastructure and operations reduction of nonpoint pollution restoration of stream geomorphology and biological productivity control of erosion and climate change management. This project would develop a community/stakeholder vetted approach for tracking indicators and reporting on their status relative to agreed upon goals. When monitoring and data collection allows for a consistent measurement at regular intervals programs become traceable and provide information as to whether or not actions/policies are effective in implementing goals. The assessment process seeks to find out if goals are on target to being realized and to identify where more effort is needed. A well-conceived indicator provides a baseline and a target which allows the implementer to understand the indicator trend. A good indicator will identify trends whether positive or negative and will identify a potential problem while corrective actions can still be implemented. Decision-making and policy formulation within the Napa River watershed would continue to be  business as usual.  Without leadership from this project reporting of indicators will continue to be implemented in an ad hoc manner with no integrated measure of the watershed health. The Napa River WAF approach is built on metrics and indicators that are organized into a hierarchical structure corresponding to aspects of ecological economic and social conditions based on community derived goals for the Napa River watershed. Central to the WAF is the description of goals for the watershed or sub-region being evaluated. From these goals measurable objectives are crafted and indicators selected to assess the condition relative to the established goal. A trend analysis based on watershed indicator measurements is critical for establishing the data and information on which to base policy decisions develop programs and assess their effectiveness in improving the health and function of the Napa River watershed and its receiving bodies throughout the San Francisco Bay ecosystem. ","Project Benefits: The project's immediate benefits are most directly related to resource stewardship as described below. However it is important to note that the project is critical in realizing overall health benefits to the entire Napa River watershed by establishing community goals collecting system wide data and indicators and assessing the watershed status relative to goals. From this important foundation subsequent programs can be implemented and their effectiveness measured. Implementation of the project will allow the community to make informed policy decisions and implement programs to achieve desired level of health and function of the Napa River watershed. These direct and indirect benefits are briefly described below. Water Supply: (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) The project will provide data and information on the quantity of water supplies that are available to the watershed. Detailed information can be used to inform policy decisions regarding the water availability and to develop programs to ensure continuous and reliable water supplies are available to all users. Water Quality: The project will provide data and information on the quality of surface and groundwater supplies within the watershed. This information will provide the community with a reliable and accurate representation of the status and trend of water quality for all water resources within the watershed. The baseline data and metrics on water quality parameters can be used to inform decisions on managing water resources to preserve and enhance the quality of water supplies. Flood Control and Stormwater Management: The project will provide important metrics and collect data on indictors related to flood management and control via the amount of non-developed flood plain within the watershed. This information can be utilized to adaptively manage for flooding and stormwater in a manner that provides benefits to the overall watershed. Resource Stewardship: (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) Project implementation provides for the selection of indicators analyses and report generation in an open and transparent manner thereby creating an educational (and networking) opportunity for all involved and linking structural and functional measures of the watershed. Implementation of the WAF will assist in restoring value and function of the watershed to meet community goals. Presently the Napa River watershed has no integrated way of documenting the changing dynamics of the system. The project will develop methodology to measure trends in system functioning for a number of important indicators including biological hydrological land use and economic. By identifying those sectors that are falling short of established goals the community can emphasis efforts and allocate resource in a targeted way on improving these trends through focused programs and strategies. The Project identifies metrics and indicators that will provide a meaningful measure relating the health and trend of the Napa River watershed relative to community goals. Currently data are generally insufficient or desperate to identify which metrics will best reflect whether an ecosystem is on a clear trajectory toward improvement because of the paucity of studies that couple functional measures with routine quantification of ecosystem structure. Choosing indicators that reflect existing conditions facilitates a better understanding of how actions in a specific region can affect watershed function and structure overall. For example downstream conditions are important to consider since tidal influence results in reverse flows on a portion of the River. It is likely that health of Napa River watershed (surface flows) is partially dependent on downstream conditions. By focusing upon a process that is community-driven for establishing an annual Report Card and Watershed Sustainability Index for the Napa River watershed this project will maximize public involvement as well as build local and regional partnerships. Application of the WAF in the Napa River watershed is one means by which to track a limited number of informative indicators allowing watershed residents businesses visitors and managers to easily assess the state of the watershed to see trends or changes in conditions over time and to adapt their actions to achieve desired conditions (i.e. watershed goals). This project will result in an assessment framework that decision-makers and community members can use to guide development of indicators that address real on-the-ground issues related to environmental social and economic health of the watershed (or any other ecosystem) stated as a report card.

Habitat Protection and Restoration - Project result will be a reduction in methylmercury production and concentration up food chain. ","Detailed description: Project involves consideration of several control methods to reduce methyl mercury production including the installation of a hypolimnetic oxygenator which will supply oxygen to the lower depths of the reservoir during periods of stratification (Apr-Nov). As the reservoir stratifies oxygen in the lower depths is depleted until there is no oxygen present. Under these conditions mercury present in the sediment can be converted into methyl mercury which is soluble and enters the food chain. Mercury consumed by aquatic species bio-accumulates. Providing oxygen to the lower depths of the reservoir will prevent depletion of oxygen and eliminate the production of methyl mercury.In order to generate oxygen a pressure swing adsorption module would be engineered and constructed on site (or construction of a large refrigerated tank to store liquid oxygen) along with associated communications equipment to permit remote monitoring and control via SCADA. Compressors would deliver the oxygen to the lower depths of the reservoir. A Speece cone or other inverted cone typical of hypolimnetic aeration or oxygenation systems would be engineered and constructed to allow mixing of the oxygen with waters in the lower depth without mixing the lake. Mixing of the lake is undesirable because this would result in warm water being released from the lake and this in turn is not suitable for the species of fish currently supported by the streams below the reservoir. Disadvantaged Community: This project does not provide benefits specifically for a DAC; the project will benefit the region in general. Scalability: The grant request amount is scalable. ","Project Need: Regional needs addressed by this project include the regional priority of Health of the Bay and Creeks. This project will protect and restore watershed conditions minimize non-point source pollution and improve conditions that have led to a Mercury TMDL for Walker Creek. Under current conditions mercury that is present in the sediment within Soulajule reservoir can be converted into methyl mercury which is soluble and enters the food chain. Mercury consumed by aquatic species bio-accumulates and is ultimately passed up the food chain including to human consumers of fish. This project would provide oxygen to the lower depths of the reservoir consequently preventing depletion of oxygen and eliminating the production of methyl mercury. Need - Reduce the potential for Methyl Mercury production in Soulajule reservoir. Benefit - wildlife that depends on aquatic life to survive. Reduction or elimination of MeHg from Soulajule will prevent bioaccumulation in aquatic species. Project monitoring will be conducted for at least ten years following project implementation in accordance with IRWM grant requirements. Marin Municipal Water District will conduct effectiveness monitoring by collecting water quality and fish tissue samples and report on findings annually. Measurable project goals include reduction of methyl mercury in fish tissue and reduction in aqueous methyl mercury; effectiveness will be evaluated by afore mentioned sampling and evaluation of results against the TMDLs. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If this project is not implemented mercury present in the sediment in Soulajule reservoir will continue to be converted into methyl mercury. The soluble methyl mercury will continue to enter the food chain. Mercury consumed by aquatic species bio-accumulates. So not implementing this project would result in continued bio-accumulation of mercury in aquatic species and continued passage of the mercury up the food chain. Critical impacts to Arroyo Sausal as the recovery of this stream as Coho Salmon habitat is limited with current water quality. As described above this project addresses the regional priority of Health of the Bay and Creeks. This project will protect and restore watershed conditions minimize non-point source pollution and improve conditions that have led to a Mercury TMDL for Walker Creek. ","Project Benefits: i.

Water Quality This project will provide a Water Quality benefit as it involves the installation of a hypolimnetic oxygenator which will supply oxygen to the lower depths of Soulajule reservoir consequently preventing depletion of oxygen and eliminating the production of methyl mercury. During periods of stratification (Apr-Nov) in the reservoir oxygen in the lower depths is depleted until there is no oxygen present. Under these conditions mercury present in the sediment can be converted into methyl mercury which is soluble and enters the food chain. Mercury consumed by aquatic species bio-accumulates. Providing oxygen to the lower depths of the reservoir will prevent depletion of oxygen and eliminate the production of methyl mercury. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) This project will provide a Resource Stewardship benefit as it involves improving water quality for the benefit of aquatic species. Project involves the installation of a hypolimnetic oxygenator which will supply oxygen to the lower depths of the reservoir during periods of stratification (Apr-Nov). As the reservoir stratifies oxygen in the lower depths is depleted until there is no oxygen present. Under these conditions mercury present in the sediment can be converted into methyl mercury which is soluble and enters the food chain. Mercury consumed by aquatic species bio-accumulates. Providing oxygen to the lower depths of the reservoir will prevent depletion of oxygen and eliminate the production of methyl mercury. This project will implement a solution which will generate and deliver oxygen to the lower depths of Soulajule reservoir in a manner which will allow mixing of the oxygen with waters in the lower depth without mixing the lake. Mixing of the lake is undesirable because this would result in warm water being released from the lake and this in turn is not suitable for the species of fish currently supported by the streams below the reservoir. So the project provides direct benefits to aquatic species by preventing production of methyl mercury and provides additional benefits by doing so in a manner that preserves cooler temperatures in water released to Walker Creek which benefits aquatic species downstream of the reservoir. No formal cost/benefit analysis has been performed for this project however the conceptual level costs for implementation of mercury control measures includes: Hypolimnetic Oxygenation - $2 Million Vigorous Epilimnetic mixing - $2Million These control measures in concert with other measures will result in an improvement to the water quality and aquatic habit in Soulajule reservoir and in the downstream waters of Arroyo Sausal and Walker Creek that are home to steelhead and Coho salmon.

","Project Need: Upstream erosion and pollution are primary sources of downstream water-quality degradation. San Lorenzo Creek is subject to excessive sediment that disrupts water conveyance and to heavily polluted water that further degrades water quality in the Bay. Primary upstream sources of erosion and pollution include: natural rainfall building encroachment cattle grazing equine facilities direct animal access to the creek bed animal waste agricultural practices failing septic tanks dumping and construction of private roads and structures. In many instances these activities occur on private property that border tributaries. Encouraging community participation and stewardship is critical to both the long-term health of the San Lorenzo Creek Watershed and the viability of the flood-control system. The Watershed Stewardship Program seeks to collaborate with residents and landowners to reduce erosion and pollution and to maintain and restore natural creek channels. These endeavors will contribute to improved flood attenuation water quality and creek aesthetics. Natural creek reaches in San Lorenzo Creek Bolinas Norris and Crow Creek watersheds present especially promising opportunities for maintenance and restoration. The middle watershed could also benefit from focused attention. Creek banks between the dams and the concrete channel continue to erode through natural processes and erosion has been accelerated because the reservoirs trap the sediment that would normally replenish this reach. The program relies on a strong public outreach element to convey the most up-to-date information about best watershed-management practices. Key components of best management practices include: utilizing modern biotechnical creek-bank stabilization techniques restoring floodplain terraces removing non-native species from the corridor retaining large woody debris planting native riparian vegetation eliminating grazing of cattle directly in the riparian corridor and reducing impervious surfaces where possible. Biotechnical bank stabilization is especially effective in minimizing erosion while respecting local ecology. The technique uses native vegetation and other natural materials to reinforce creek banks as opposed to the more traditionally-used concrete and steel. This treatment results in improved riparian and aquatic habitat; attractive natural bank conditions; and a more cost-effective long-term solution as compared to conventional methods. A robust and effective Watershed Stewardship Program requires the Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District and service-delivery partners to proactively cooperate with targeted communities to build trust and provide support through technical consulting and other disciplines to ensure that the efforts result in real change. In addition to public outreach an integral part of the Watershed Stewardship Program involves providing technical assistance to property owners to identify creek-related challenges and implement solutions. Assistance may include site visits methods and materials consultations access to equipment and in-the-field implementation direction. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Because San Lorenzo Creek is subject both to excessive sediment that disrupts water conveyance and to heavily polluted water that further degrades water quality in the Bay non-implementation of the Watershed Stewardship Program would mean continued upstream erosion and pollution which are the primary sources of downstream water-quality degradation. In many instances these activities occur on private property that border tributaries. Encouraging community participation and stewardship is critical to both the long-term health of the San Lorenzo Creek Watershed and the viability of the flood-control system. Without the Watershed Stewardship Program's collaboration with residents and landowners to reduce erosion and pollution and to maintain and restore natural creek channels the area will not benefit from flood attenuation and will continue to experience degraded water quality and creek aesthetics.

","Detailed description:  Agencies achieve more consistent reliable and efficient water service from working together across a regional area. The trend is to solve issues regionally    (Agency representative speaking to how regional collaboration benefits the San Francisco Bay Region 2009) The Bay Area's largest water agencies which serve the needs of over 5.6 million people are working together to connect their water systems with interties that will improve the ability to sustain an adequate water supply after catastrophic events such as earthquakes while also increasing the ability for these agencies to develop and share water resources more efficiently. The five water agencies include Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District - Zone 7 (Zone 7) Contra Costa Water District (CCWD) East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) and the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD). After disruptions in regular water supply sources or during planned outages of critical systems temporary water supplies can be moved (or  wheeled ) between these agencies through these interties to ensure adequate amounts of water are available to help meet health and safety needs while minimizing customer curtailments. These interties also complete most of the infrastructure necessary for these five agencies to wheel new water supplies including from regional desalination and water transfers or creation of new regional groundwater banking and surface water storage programs that they can share efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive manner. Existing inter-ties between the partner agencies include the EBMUD-SFPUC intertie which was completed in 2002 with a capacity of 30 million gallons per day (MGD); the untreated CCWD-EBMUD intertie was completed in 2007 with a capacity of 45 to 100 MGD; and the SFPUC-SCVWD intertie was completed in 2002 with a capacity of 30 MGD. Remaining links in this regional effort include an intertie between EBMUD and Zone 7 and an expanded connection between EBMUD and CCWD s treated water systems. Consequently this project will construct a 10-15 MGD intertie and pump station between EBMUD s East of Hills water system and CCWD s water system. The intertie would connect the two systems in Pleasant Hill and in the case of EBMUD deliver treated water south to the Walnut Creek area and for CCWD water delivered through the intertie would be delivered to residents in Pleasant Hill and Concord. ","Project Need: The Bay Area's largest water agencies are working together to connect their water systems to improve the ability to sustain adequate water supplies after catastrophic events and to convey water supplies to meet future demands; this project is one of the last remaining connections that will improve regional water supply reliability during droughts and emergencies. Based on future water demand forecasts Bay Area water agencies predict potential future supply shortfalls particularly during extended droughts (e.g. three or more years). As a result agencies are seeking out alternative supplies through numerous alternatives including the Freeport Regional Water Project storing water in the Los Vaqueros Reservoir and the Bay Area Regional Desalination Project. Supplies from all these potential existing and future sources would benefit from an expanded treated water connection between EBMUD and CCWD. The following is an example of how these projects and the EBMUD/CCWD intertie rely on each other and can work together to meet the future Bay Area water supply needs. EBMUD s Water Supply Master Plan 2040 incorporated an analysis of how EBMUD s participation in the Los Vaqueros Expansion could provide EBMUD with supplemental supplies. During wetter years EBMUD would store water in the Los Vaqueros Reservoir for use when needed in dry years. From Los Vaqueros Reservoir CCWD can deliver the stored water back to EBMUD through the existing untreated water intertie or through a treated water connection. Due to delivery limitations on the untreated intertie an expanded treated water connection adds an alternative delivery route to maximize the total water deliveries. The Bay Area Regional Desalination Project relies on a similar concept; during wet years excess production from the facility would be stored in Los Vaqueros Reservoir and delivered in dry years when partner water demand increases. Delivering water to EBMUD through an expanded EBMUD/CCWD intertie enables water deliveries to the other Bay Area partners (Zone 7 SCVWD and SFPUC). The treated water connection adds diversity and reliability to each of the Bay Area agency s water supply portfolio. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: An expanded EBMUD/CCWD treated water intertie greatly improves Bay Area water agency's ability to support each other during emergencies and droughts. Without it the ability for Bay Area agencies to efficiently manage supplies during shortages is hindered. For example without the expanded treated water intertie CCWD cannot supply water stored in Los Vaqueros to EBMUD unless EBMUD simultaneously is in a drought and taking water from Freeport. Getting water to EBMUD outside of this limited operational windowin turn enables water deliveries to SFPUC and SCVWD through existing interties and to Zone 7 through a new intertie (see IRWM project proposal). ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) In dry years when customer demands are highest the intertie could supply 10-15 million gallons per day of treated water. Once delivered from CCWD to EBMUD the water could then be delivered to Zone 7 through a new treated water intertie (see IRWM project proposal) SFPUC through an existing EBMUD/SFPUC intertie in Hayward and then to SCVWD through an existing intertie (or via shared customers) with SFPUC. ii. Water Quality ... iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) Improving the connectedness between Bay Area Agencies opens internal channels of coordination and communication that enhance the regional stewardship of water supplies. With future uncertainties related to climate change and species decline the importance of this regional coordination and joint stewardship of water supplies cannot be underestimated as the magnitude of shared challenges increases.

"265 ","Central Dublin RW Distribution and Retrofit Project ","This project is to extend DSRSD's recycled water distribution system to parks and schools in the established central part of the City of Dublin thereby reducing overall ultimate portable water demand in the DSRSD service area by approximately 200 acre feet per year. This project will also allow for future expansion of DSRSD's distribution system further to the western part of Dublin. ","('East Bay';) | Alameda ","37.7059457 | -121.9217323 ","10/1/2008 ","12/31/2012 ","Project in DSRSD's service area - 7051 Dublin Blvd. Dublin CA 94568 ","Project Type Description: Drinking Water Supply - This project will augment the Drinking Water supply by using Recycled Water for what is now potable irrigation. Water Reuse/Recycling - This project will help make Recycled Water available to customers in the developed central core of the City of Dublin. Groundwater benefits - This project will mean less groundwater will be pumped from local resources during the summer months and more of the imported water from the Delta may be used to recharge the local groundwater basin. ","Detailed description: The Dublin San Ramon Services District's (DSRSD) Central Dublin Recycled Water Distribution and Retrofit Project (Project) will expand DSRSD's existing recycled water distribution system to deliver up to 240 acre-feet per year (AFY) of recycled water within its service area. This Project entails constructing recycled water distribution pipelines to convey water for landscape irrigation to several sites which includes schools parks a multi-family residential complex and streetscapes and medians along the pipeline alignments. The Project consists of approximately 4260 feet of 12-inch recycled water main 1760 feet of 6-inch recycled water main and 2250 feet of 4-inch recycled water main. The lines will be constructed from the 16-inch DERWA main supply line located in the Iron Horse Trail to the Project customers. The Project will also provide plumbing retrofits to connect existing irrigation systems at Dublin schools and parks to the recycled water system. The Project will be designed to have a maximum delivery capacity of 340 AFY. This project will also enable the District to extend its recycled water distribution system further west into established areas of Dublin to connect other users in the future to permanently reduce potable demand by an additional 100+ acre-feet per year. ","Project Need: This Project will ultimately reduce/postpone development of new or expanded water supplies and will replace potable water currently used for irrigation and construction. The recycled water supply would also offset the water supply provided by the Zone 7 Water Agency (Zone 7) from the State Water Project (SWP) which would consequently reduce diversions reduce groundwater extraction and reduce energy use (by reduced pumping). The expanded use of recycled water would also reduce the burden on existing Federal water supply facilities such as the Central Valley Project (CVP). The SWP and CVP water contract allocations are closely inter-connected and the supply of recycled water would reduce demand and utilization of those valuable drinking water resources. Recycled Water is a drought resistant supply available all year long and can be stored in existing facilities already built. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Without this project there will be additional demands on the potable supplies provided by the State Water Project and the regional ground water basin. Thus DSRSD's water supply will be more reliant on the already stressed water resources. DSRSD's water supply will become less reliable in the future with less flexibility and less able to meet additional demands from continued development in our service area. Economic development in our service area will be stunted by the lack of reliable water supply. DSRSD's customers and regional customers will face their water supplies being reduced; with their water bills increasing. In the event of a state-wide drought increased pressure will be placed on the regional water basin; with the potential of salt water encroachment on the basin now used for potable storage. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality ... iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) ... This project will help make Recycled Water available to more customers for landscape irrigation project to replace potable water formerly used for irrigation in the central core of the City of Dublin. This project will help extend a successful DERWA joint venture (DSRSD and EBMUD) bringing recycled water to new areas for additional conservation of our potable resources. The use of recycled water in central Dublin will reduce irrigation with potable water by 347 AF per year. This project stretches the potable water supply of the Bay/Delta region by replacing some of the the potable water from the State Water Project now used for irrigation with recycled water from DSRSD's WWTP. Also drop for drop recycled water used for irrigation is that much less water that has to be pumped out to be disposed of in San Francisco Bay. So the project will result in 347 AF per year LESS of WWTP effluent disposed of in the Bay and the corresponding decrease in electrical energy consumption needed to pump those volumes from the Tri-Valley area to the Bay. By reducing potable consumption this project will help DSRSD as a Water Retailer meet the 20% by 2020 potable water reduction requirements set by state law. It will also serve as a demonstration project for the beneficial uses of Recycled Water to area residents. With this successful project underway DSRSD and DERWA will be able to bring additional Recycled Water projects to the Tri-Valley area for implementation.

Wildcat San Pablo Garrity and Rheem Creeks drain 40584 acres of land ranging from near pristine oak woodlands in portions of the upper watershed to highly urbanized regions in the lower watershed of El Sobrante Richmond and San Pablo California. ","Project Type Description: Water Quality Improvement: In order to improve water quality in the San Pablo Wildcat Rheem and Garrity Creek watersheds the coordinators will work with community project partners and cooperators to identify and create a plan to address and reduce non-point source pollution (NPSP) priority action areas. The coordinators will compile and analyze existing water quality data identify dumping sites and other NPSP and prioritize work areas. The coordinators will work with the City of San Pablo and Richmond to assist with fulfillment of Municipal Regional Permit requirements (MRP) and will recruit and train volunteers to help conduct at least three trash assessments in collaboration with Contra Costa County Watershed Program and municipal authorities. Based on preliminary findings the coordinators will determine if there is a need to perform additional samplings. Moreover the coordinators will engage the community in other stewardship activities such as creek clean ups and creek mapping. The coordinators will recruit volunteers through community meetings and newsletters; both of these will also serve to educate the public about issues associated with water quality and creek ecology and the most effective ways they can reduce their impact on the creeks. The coordinators will also work with the Cities of San Pablo and Richmond and West Contra Costa County School District to develop service-learning opportunities for students aimed at reducing NPSP. Stormwater Improvements/Infiltration: The watershed coordinators will initiate the development of multiple strategically located stormwater management projects using low impact development strategies throughout the San Pablo Bay South watershed. These projects will reduce surface runoff and flooding and will enhance infiltration. The coordinators will work with community groups and local municipal agencies to determine key project sites that will produce the largest impact on stormwater management and will enable effective and long-term community engagement. By building LID projects on the community level this plan will also increase watershed awareness and the overall ability of communities to understand the impacts of and properly respond to storm events. Additionally projects like rain gardens and bioswales will increase infiltration of surface water. Habitat Protection and Restoration: To address the improvement of habitat in the San Pablo Wildcat Rheem and Garrity Creek watersheds the coordinators will collaborate with project partners and watershed stakeholders to identify and prioritize invasive plant removal and re-vegetation project sites. Volunteers will be recruited trained and coordinated by the watershed coordinators to participate in invasive plant removal and native re-vegetation community work days. Coordinators will work with the Contra Costa County Recycle More program the Bay-Friendly Gardening program and cities of San Pablo and Richmond to coordinate native plant wildlife/green gardening or waste reduction workshops for homeowners and residents within select invasive plant removal and re-vegetation project sites areas. All invasive plant removal and re-vegetation projects will be initiated as grassroots efforts managed primarily by the local community in order to ensure long-term maintenance and care. Relation to Disadvantaged Communities: The majority of people directly served by the community-based activities in the work plan live in the Cities of Richmond and San Pablo or the unincorporated community of North Richmond all of which are marked as Disadvantaged Communities on the IRWMP maps. The projects in the work plan focus on community-based activities. These include a variety of stewardship opportunities such as invasive plant removal planting and maintenance of native plants trash assessments and cleanups water quality monitoring and active construction of restoration and Low Impact Development projects. In addition to engaging the community in stewardship community outreach is also used to include people in project planning and design. Service learning activities merge education with direct action to improve watershed conditions. We also will make numerous in-class presentations to students.

","Detailed description: The San Pablo Bay South Watershed includes some of the best remaining natural habitats in the Bay Area including the largest regional shoreline park the largest eelgrass beds and extensive mudflats and tidal marshes. The Watershed Project is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to inspiring and educating San Francisco Bay Area communities to protect their local watersheds. For more than 15 years The Watershed Project (TWP) has utilized watershed coordinator positions to facilitate watershed improvements at the local level by building consensus-based Astakeholder involvement in identifying watershed conditions and developing viable solutions to enable communities to most effectively address issues in their local watershed. Implementation of the proposed work plan in partnership with the San Pablo Watershed Neighbors Education and Restoration Society (SPAWNERS) a volunteer based community organization will provide one full time watershed coordinator position for the San Pablo Bay South Watershed to play the critical role of obtaining funding for projects garnering stakeholder buy-in and support and setting the stage for future project implementation in order to achieve identified watershed restoration and protection goals. TWP is located within this watershed and has a demonstrated commitment to working with other stakeholders to collaboratively improve our watershed. The expected outcomes include an increase in the sustainability and effectiveness of community-based watershed efforts measurable improvements in the reduction of non point source pollution and habitat improvement and a regional approach to improving the larger Bay-Delta system. The continued urbanization of the San Pablo Bay South Watershed farther into interior valleys and uplands threatens to further alter watershed processes and constrain opportunities for restoration of watershed functions. Nevertheless opportunities exist to slow or prevent the destruction and to restore some of the ecological functions that have been lost. This watershed is fortunate to have a few existing subwatershed groups that work in conjunction with numerous government agencies scientists and environmental organizations to actively seize those opportunities. Current watershed efforts do not have the resources or expertise to pursue sustainable funding effectively influence policy manage large restoration efforts or gain footing as leaders in the conservation community without the support of paid watershed coordinators positions. The Watershed Project s proposed work plan is designed to implement strategies that restore and protect critical watershed functions through community awareness stewardship and restoration so lessons are learned and past mistakes not repeated. The San Pablo Bay South Watershed Awareness and Action Plan will ensure the sustainability and impact of community-based watershed protection efforts. The campaign will : 1) Develop a strategy for reducing non-point sources of pollution in San Pablo Wildcat Rheem and Garrity Creek watersheds; 2) Create a plan for diversifying plant communities and increasing local populations of native plants while reducing the population of invasive vegetation in selected work areas of San Pablo Wildcat Rheem and Garrity Creeks; 3) Identify and implement key low impact development design features to be implemented on the community level; and 4) Ensure the continuation of these efforts by creating fundraising partnership building and information sharing strategies.

","Project Need: The issues of greatest concern in the San Pablo Bay South watershed are: Impaired water quality degraded habitat conditions and seasonal flooding in the watershed's urban communities. Impaired water quality: The bodies of water addressed by this work plan (which includes San Pablo Bay) are impaired by chlordane DDt dieldrin dioxin compounds exotic species furan compounds mercury nickel PcBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) selenium Diazinon and trash. Habitat conditions: A major biodiversity issue identified for this watershed is the presence of non-native vegetation and its negative impacts on habitat. Invasive plants such as Algerian and English Ivy Periwinkle Pampas Grass and Himalayan Blackberry compete with native vegetation choke trees and reduce niches for local wildlife. Seasonal flooding: Urban development causes higher creek flows during storm events which leads to increased creek bank erosion sediment transport and pollutant loading of the receiving water bodies. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Watershed coordinators are the glue that hold together integrated watershed management projects. Their primary goal is to facilitate partnerships and engage communities in on-the-ground action to protect our precious streams and bays. These coordinators will galvanize the community around the priorities identified in the visioning and planning projects conducted over the past five years. At least three new sites have been planned in the San Pablo Creek watershed two sites have been prioritized in the Wildcat watershed and one large restoration project has been planned for Rheem Creek watershed at Breuner Marsh. The successful implementation of these restoration projects depends on the coordination of multiple stakeholders and requires community involvement and stewardship. Many of these projects will fall apart at the seams without a watershed coordinator. The Watershed Project has also been working very closely with municipalities in the implementation of their water quality goals and the coordinator plays a strong role in the outreach and education component necessary to eliminate non-point source pollutants from the San Pablo Bay watershed and in the monitoring and assessment of pollutants of concern. Without the coordinator most of the sites will not be monitored by an impartial partner and short-term pollution removal projects will not develop into comprehensive management strategies that leverage support from the community. The coordinator will further develop partnerships with local youth groups schools and after-school programs to educate the community about pollution prevention and raise awareness about watershed issues. The coordinator will play an important role in creating stakeholder partnerships to further improve the watershed conditions and has the task of addressing issues that concern more than one municipality or local jurisdiction within all the watersheds of San Pablo Bay South. The San Pablo Bay Watershed is part of the CALFED solution area. It has been identified by NOAA as a priority for shoreline conservation due to its invaluable sudtidal and marsh ecosystems and has been identified as a critical riparian corridor by the Contra Costa County Flood Control District. Moreover municipalities have been working on multiple plans to address flooding issues and have identified the need for Low Impact Development measures to reduce the risk of flooding in the lower watersheds. Wildcat San Pablo and Garrity are plagued with trash and have been deemed trash hotspots by Contra Costa County. Rheem Creek has been identified as a priority for restoration of marsh ecosystems by East Bay Regional Parks District. The coordinator will work on long term solutions to the issues troubling these watersheds by uniting the energy of government nonprofit and community organizations to protect and enhance this critical watershed. ","Project Benefits: (A.) Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.): The Watershed Awareness and Action Plan for the San Pablo Bay South Watershed will increase groundwater recharge after each LID project has been implemented. Also revegetation or creekside properties with native plants will help with water conservation and increase percolation. (B.) Water Quality: All projects implemented in the watershed will lead to a cleaner San Pablo Bay. School based programs will result in greater stormwater pollution prevention awareness. Waste free events at schools and trash management education will results in lower levels of trash entering the bay. Monitoring stations will ensure constant monitoring of basic water quality and pollutants of concern around the watersheds of the San Pablo Bay. Cleanups and waste reduction programs will stop trash from entering local waterways. LID projects will not only serve as educational tools but will also reduce pollutant-filled storwater from entering the Bay. (C.) Flood and Stormwater Management: The implementation of community-based LID projects will result in reduced surface runoff in the region and will enhance infiltration. We expect to identify ten sites and to design and install three of those community-based LID projects by the end of the grant. (D.) Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.): Native plants create the necessary habitat to increase bird and insect populations in the area. We will increase the diversity in the restoration sites by 50% and increase structure diversity by 50%. This will increase the overall resiliency of the ecosystem and enhance its ecosystem value.

By reducing urban runoff LID projects are improving water quality since less non-point source pollutants are carried downstream. Infiltration is a natural water purifier process that allows for the groundwater replenishment. Also by increasing infiltration less peak flows will occur and flood frequency will diminish. Decreasing urban runoff and improving water quality as direct beneficial impact on nearby creeks and other water bodies. Demonstrating this projects in schools in Contra Costa County is extremely important since it will educate a new generation in several disadvantaged communities that deal with many environmental injustices. ","Detailed description: The Contra Costa County LID School Program offers classroom and on-the-ground LID education programs for students within the Contra Costa County. Students learn about watershed health stormwater management the causes and effects of water pollution and what they can do to protect local creeks and the Bay. The Contra Costa County LID School Program addresses local water quality environmental design and habitat issues. The program offers classroom lessons designed to complement teachers  curricula. Classroom programs serve as preparation for students to implement a demonstration LID project within the school facilities. With the demonstration project students have the opportunity to learn hands-on how LID system operate and spend time outdoors. ","Project Need: The Contra Costa County LID School Program aims to educate students and provide stewardship for water resources in the Bay Area region. The lack of awareness and understanding of the natural functions and components of the water cycle and the urban impacts on it bring up the issues of poor water quality floods erosion infrastructure incapacity extinction of natural habitats and others. There is an urgent need to educate communities on the impacts of urban life in our natural environment in this case water resources. Teaching Low Impact Development is beneficial to raise consciousness on how to mitigate most of the problems mentioned above. Many neighborhoods in the Contra Costa County are categorized as low income/ disadvantaged communities. These communities lack green areas suffer from constant floods deal with environmental injustice from one the biggest oil refineries in the country and need the knowledge to solve these issues in their own 'backyard'. By providing an educational program with demonstration projects conceived built and managed with the students themselves we are promoting their awareness and improving their knowledge to replicate these initiatives in other sites. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If there is not a strong educational program of Low Impact Development we are missing the opportunity to empower communities to solve a lot of the pollution and natural disasters problems that impact Contra Costa County and the Bay Area in general. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) This program will educate students about LID retrofit measures they can employ to reduce the quantity and increase the quality of stormwater runoff. These measures use infiltration evapotranspiration and harvest for use in irrigation to manage stormwater volumes and eliminate pollutant-laden runoff. ii. Water Quality These LID retrofit measures will eliminate disproportionately pollutant-laden  first flush  runoff from installation sites and reduce runoff volumes. Among pollutant sources to be addressed are atmospheric deposition (mercury dioxins etc.) vehicles (such as hydrocarbons and copper) landscape/building maintenance (including diazinon) and littering (trash). iii. Flood and Stormwater Management These LID retrofit strategies as designed will manage 100% of runoff from storms of up to   inch (and the first   inch of larger storms). iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) These LID strategies improve the general urban environment by providing more green areas reducing pollution and runoff reducing erosion in adjacent water-bodies improving the habitat conditions in adjacent water-bodies increasing groundwater recharge decreasing sewer overflow and floods providing educational opportunities etc. ","  "," ","The Watershed Project ","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1"
"268 ","Cleaning up trash in the Bay Area's stormwater ","This project builds on the San Francisco Estuary Partnership's Bay Area-wide Trash Capture Demonstration Project which provided federal and state funding to 65 Bay Area municipalities attempting to deal with our region's significant trash problem; and on a related project awarded Prop 84 planning grant in 2012 \"Tracking California's Trash.\" ","('North Bay'; 'East Bay'; 'South Bay'; 'West Bay') | Alameda; Contra Costa; Solano; Napa; Sonoma; Marin; San Mateo; Santa Clara ","37.89734321293039 | -122.42889404296875 ","As soon as contracting is complete ","Three years from project initiation ","The Bay Area-wide Trash Capture Demonstration Project is providing trash capture devices to 64 Bay Area municipalities. All of these have a permit requirement to capture trash especially the NPDES Phase I entities covered by the SF Bay Regional Water Board's Municipal Regional Stormwater Permit (Santa Clara San Mateo Alameda and Contra Costa county entities plus Vallejo and Fairfield-Suisun). Depending on the amount awarded we may decide to site very large (and costly) devices in bottom-of-watershed locations where they will capture trash from several municipalities before it enters the Bay; or we may continue to support a more distributed trash capture strategy. We hope that our Phase I municipalities (in Marin Sonoma Napa and rural Solano Counties) will join the IRWMP project. ","Project Type Description: Water Quality Improvement: 24 Bay Area locations are recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as impaired by trash. Save the Bay has listed 225 creeks and other sites where trash is a significant problem. Trash contributes to water quality impairment and degrades aquatic and riparian habitat in numerous ways. Stormwater Improvement: Storm drainage infrastructure is a major conveyance of trash from streets and developed areas to our creeks and the Bay. Trash capture devices installed in catch basins or storm lateral junctures as well as the portion of the project that will develop and test landscape-based trash removal strategies (LID) will dramatically improve stormwater quality. Habitat protection and restoration: Riparian areas and creek banks are collection points for trash as well as important habitat. This project will improve riparian habitat in many places. Flood protection: When trash clogs a storm drain inlet during a rain event (as often happens) flooding results. Removal of trash from inlets during regular maintenance will keep stormwater flowing through the system to its outfalls. Studies show that disadvantaged urban areas are significant trash generation sites. At the same time municipalities with large disadvantaged populations often have only minimal budget if any to deal with the problem. This project will prioritize location and installation of trash capture devices in disadvantaged communities. ","Detailed description: Antecedent projects: This project builds on the San Francisco Estuary Partnership's Bay Area-wide Trash Capture Demonstration Project (Demonstration Project) which provides full trash capture devices to 65 municipalities in seven Bay Area counties. The Demonstration Project also built the Bay Area Trash Tracker (www.bayareatrashtracker.org; login trashtracker; password 6f5fe58) a GIS-based system of tracking trash capture installation locations surrounding land use characteristics and maintenance data. In 2012 a Prop 84 award to the Bay Area Stormwater Management Agencies Association (\"Tracking California's Trash\") is providing funds to add a trash hotspots layer to the Tracker; add full capture devices/locations in the City of Los Angeles; and create a Trash Portal for the California Water Quality Monitoring Council. In addition the Prop 84 project will develop a method for measuring and monitoring trash in receiving waters; and charting the effectiveness of trash reduction best management practices. Results of these two elements of the project will also be posted on the Trash Tracker and the Portal. IRWMP project concept: We hope to use IRWMP funds to provide additional full capture devices in locations and of types that will be most efficient and cost-effective based on data gathered in the Demonstration Project. In addition we will design and test LID-based trash reduction solutions and add a LID layer to the Tracker. Throughout we will take advantage of lessons learned in the Demonstration Project and depending on timing the Prop 84 trash initiatives. How the project will function: SFEP/ABAG staff will manage all elements of the project in close cooperation with countywide stormwater program and municipal staff. Over the past three years we have developed excellent working relationships with Bay Area stormwater program staff at all levels. SFEP/ABAG will put out an RFP for trash capture devices that meet the standards of the Municipal Regional Stormwater NPDES Permit. ABAG will then contract with municipalities that will order oversee installation and accept ownership and maintenance responsibility for devices ABAG will purchase. In addition we will contract for development of LID-based approaches to trash reduction and install demonstration projects in cooperating cities. Finally we will contract for addition of a LID layer to the Tracker and work with cities and ABAG staff to enter useful information about LID projects into the map-based system. ","Project Need: All Bay Area residents are aware that we have a significant trash problem. Trash degrades water quality and aquatic and riparian habitat; contributes to the Texas-size horrific Pacific Gyre or \"Garbage Patch\"; causes flooding when trash clogs storm drainage infrastructure during storm events; may present a human health hazard; and creates eyesores and nuisance. Trash is ubiquitous but it tends to collect in commercial/industrial areas near schools and convenience stores along roadways and highways and in our region's most deprived residential areas. U.S. EPA has conservatively identified 24 Bay Area sites as impaired by trash (listed on the 2010 Clean Water Act section 303(d) list of impaired waters) while Save the Bay names 225 trash hotspots adjacent to Bay Area waters. Trash is a wholly anthropogenic pollution problem. Consequently the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board adopted in 2009 a Municipal Regional Stormwater NPDES Permit that requires our larger communities (\"Phase I\" NPDES communities) to reduce trash pollution to zero in phases by 2022. The State Water Resources Control Board is in the process of adopting a statewide permit for smaller communities (in the Bay Area in Marin Napa Sonoma and Solano counties) that will also require them to address trash. Yet due to severe budget restraints and municipalities' challenges in attempting to levy fees for property-based services (Prop 218) compliance with these permits and addressing trash is extremely difficult for our city and county governments. The San Francisco Estuary Partnership applies for these funds at the behest of the countywide stormwater program managers and the Bay Area's municipalities. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Trash will continue to degrade water quality and riparian/aquatic habitat. Flooding will occur in areas where trash clogs storm drainage infrastructure during storm events. LID-based strategies for reducing trash pollution will not be developed or implemented. Municipal budgets will be further strained by the costs of meeting trash-related permit requirements and some city and county governments will be out of compliance. ","Project Benefits: ii. Water Quality: The project will create significant water quality benefits as trash will be removed from the environment before it reaches creeks or the Bay. ... iii. Flood and Stormwater Management: Trash capture devices approved and supplied under this project will be designed specifically not to overflow during a storm event. Removing trash captured by devices before a storm event will reduce flooding hazard. ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) We expect devices provided by this program will be sited and managed for maximum watershed-based benefit in order to be maximally cost-effective.

Removing operating restrictions increases supplies for drinking water and recharge. ","Detailed description: The Amaden Dam spillway and outlet facilities were constructed in 1935. The reservoir has an average annual capacity of 4700 acre-feet which is approximately 4% of the local water supply produced by the District. In 1960 and again in 1999 the dam s inlet structure was raised to account for sediment and gravel accumulation on the reservoir bottom. The threat of continued reservoir sedimentation has the potential to impair the outlet works resulting in an inability to draw down the reservoir especially during high flow or emergency situations such as a seismic event. Also due to the aging dam s outlet facilities infrastructure the operation and maintenance of piping valves hydraulic lines and energy dissipaters have been an on-going issue and require attention. As part of the Water Supply and Infrastructure Master Plan all reservoirs and dams will be in continued operation in order to develop local water supplies maximize operational flexibility and ensure drinking water quality. The objective of this project is to modify or construct a new intake structure capable of releasing 246 cubic feet per second of water without flushing of sediments through the outlet works. It will correct the existing problems with the outlet energy dissipation structure piping and valves. Also making modifications to the dam's spillway as a result of the potential findings from the reservoir's PMF analysis will be determined. The objective of the project does not include restoration of the original capacity of the reservoir. ","Project Need: The Amaden Dam spillway and outlet facilities were constructed in 1935. The reservoir has an average annual capacity of 4700 acre-feet which is approximately 4% of the local water supply produced by the District. In 1960 and again in 1999 the dam s inlet structure was raised to account for sediment and gravel accumulation on the reservoir bottom. The threat of continued reservoir sedimentation has the potential to impair the outlet works resulting in an inability to draw down the reservoir especially during high flow or emergency situations such as a seismic event.

As part of the Water Supply and Infrastructure Master Plan all reservoirs and dams will be in continued operation in order to develop local water supplies maximize operational flexibility and ensure drinking water quality. On October 25 2011 staff informed the Board of the preliminary findings of the seismic stability evaluation of the Almaden Calero and Guadalupe Dams. The preliminary findings state that both the Calero Dam and Guadalupe Dam have inadequate seismic stability whereas the Almaden Dam and the Calero Auxiliary Dam have adequate stability and will not require a retrofit. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Completion of this project is required before the current DSOD operational restriction can be lifted. Failure to meet this commitment without DSOD s approval will affect the ability to impound water in the reservoir reducing the District's water supply by an average of about 2000 acre-feet per year. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) Almaden Dam provides surface storage of water that is used for drinking water supply and groundwater recharge. This local supply provides an average of about 2000 acre-feet per year of water. If the project does not proceed the District could lose this 2000 acre-feet per year of supply. Also local reservoir provide storage than can help adapt to climate change impacts. ii. Water Quality The reservoir provides a source of water for blending which can reduce treatment costs during water quality episodes such as high algae in imported source water. Improving the dam inlet and outlet works ensures effective operation of outlet works while managing sediments containing mercury in the reservoir. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management The reservoir captures local stormwater for use in the water supply system. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) Alternative water sources would have a high carbon footprint than local surface water sources.

","Detailed description: The Decoto District Green Streets Phase 3 project is a sustainable redevelopment project on eight full contiguous blocks in the City of Union City. The project proposes a system of low -impact green infrastructure elements that mimic natural systems processes to simulate predevelopment hydrology and protect water quality in Alameda Creek. The green stormwater infrastructure will consist of an interconnected series of stormwater bioretention planters and permeable paving areas to capture retain and treat stormwater runoff. Every project area intersection will be renovated to expand sidewalks into bulbouts which will provide a space for up to 71 new trees and 31 corner bioretention planters (rain gardens). Additionally there will be 25 mid -block rain gardens for a total of 56 throughout the project site. All landscaping trees and plants will be native drought-tolerant plants. Parallel parking lanes along some of the blocks will be fitted with permeable block pavers replacing 9400 square feet of impervious roadway. The pavers will actively filter runoff through underlying gravel aggregate and increase infiltration inot the soil. Overflow that does not infiltrate will enter the underdrain pipe and be conveyed to the nearest tree well (non-bioretention) as supplemental irrigation and then enter the existing storm drain system which outfalls into Alameda Creek. The bioretention planters and the permeable paver blocks will filter runoff promote infiltration and reduce peak flow rates and volumes protecting Alameda Creek from the effects of urbanization. Both BMP's have been proven to be effective and are recommended for use in the Alameda Countywide Clean Water Program C.3 Stormwater Guideline. Additionally the proposed curb extensions reduce crosswalk lengths and calm traffic which Federal Highway Administration says will improve pedestrian safety. The project also proposes shared bicycle lanes along F Street to connect the neighborhood to the existing bicycle network.

The project will have a positive impact on Alameda Creek because it provides on-site treatment for street runoff which eventually flows to Alameda Creek an important fish waterway with TMDL for pesticide -related toxicity. The project follows sustainable design principles to address root causes of environmental degradation. The design converts 34900 square feet of impervious area to pervious surface representing approximately 9% reduction of the impervious surfaces in the public right of way. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: This project is the third in a series of project that the City would like to implement to in the Decoto District (a disadvantage community). The concept is to covert the existing district into a green street district utilizing LID infrastructure to remove pollutants from roadway runoff by retaining treating and infiltration using rain gardens and permeable pavers with subdrains. If this project is not implement the stormwater runoff form the streets will continue to enter into the storm drain system which drains into Alameda Creek. Alameda Creek is listed as one of the few creeks in the Bay Area which steelhead trout used to use for migration. The hope is to re-establish this creek and its habitat to be able to support steelhead trout migration. This is a key project in order to reduce the current impacts of urbanization on Alameda Creek.

To meet refinery water demands CCCSD would expand the recycled water treatment process to convert ammonia to nitrate (via nitrification) prior to filtration. CCCSD would also rehabilitate the existing recycled water pipeline and acquire recycled water storage tanks. The project would be constructed in four phases; CCCSD predicts a total capital cost of $100 million and ultimate recycled water production of 22500 AFY (20 MGD) at build out.

","Project Type Description: CCCSD produces recycled water from wastewater collected from primarily commercial and residential customers. Most of this wastewater is treated to secondary standards and discharged to Suisun Bay. A portion of the discharge water is diverted to CCCSD's Water Reclamation facility where it undergoes additional treatment (filtration and hypochlorite disinfection). New industrial customers would replace recycled water as a substitute for potable water thus reducing freshwater diversions from the Sacramento Delta and improving regional water supply reliability. Water reuse reduces CCCSD discharge volume which reduces pollutant loading into Suisun Bay. ","Detailed description: CCCSD s recycled water quality is similar to the Delta water now used by the refineries except recycled water has ammonia that must be removed for use at the Tesoro and Shell Martinez refineries to prevent corrosion in their heat exchangers. New tertiary treatment facilities (ammonia removal filtration and disinfection) will be built to produce recycled water suitable for use in refinery cooling towers and boiler feedwater systems. The capital investments required for this project include upgrading/replacing the existing recycled water treatment conveyance and storage facilities. Treatment Improvements include a biological processes to oxidize ammonium (NH4+) to nitrate (NO3-) ($19.5 to $32.5 million) upgrading or replacing the existing dual media filtration process ( $15 to $19 million) upgrading the existing hypocholorite disinfection system ($500000) and on-WWTP-site storage facility expansion site work engineering and contractor fees and contingencies. CCCSD owns a section of pipeline to convey recycled water from the treatment process to a CCWD owned pipe which connects to the refineries. Project costs include CCCSD constructing a new pipeline to connect to CCCSD lines to the refineries. Project costs could be reduced to approximately $83.5 million if existing CCWD owned lines could be reused to convey recycled water. ","Project Need: Water recycling is a component of Contra Costa Water District s long-term sustainable water supply strategy. In times of water shortages CCWD may impose water rationing. This project reduces the water demand and mitigates water shortages during drought years. CCWD water supply is from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Using recycled water for industrial cooling and boiler feed reduces demands on the Delta. The industrial customers use 20 mgd of water in their cooling towers and boilers. The project 1) increases the amount of Delta water available to Bay Area water agencies or 2) reduces the Delta diversions or both. The project yield or volume of new water supply this project would generate depends on Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta operational rules. CCCSD and CCWD are conducting a feasibility study to estimate the project water yield. The final study should be completed by the end of the 2012 calendar year. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: From a statewide perspective on water resources the United States Bureau of Reclamation s Central Valley Project (CVP) has had difficulty meeting its contractual water obligations and the environmental water requirements imposed by the CVP Improvements Act and Endangered Species Act. In addition there are concerns that excessive water withdrawals from the Delta are jeopardizing the ecological health of the Delta and reducing its value as a public trust resource. In 2010 the California Water Resources Control Board issued a landmark report that Delta water diversions should be reduced by 50% to protect fish and other public trust resources in the Delta. The proposed refinery recycled water project would improve water supply reliability and would benefit Delta fisheries by reducing water diversions in the Delta. ","Project Benefits: As mentioned in the \"Project Needs Section\" the project increases Bay Area water supply and reliability. The project also improves industrial customer water supply reliability. By using recycled water instead of Delta water the refineries will have a reliable year-round drought proof supply of high-quality recycled water which is necessary for maintaining uninterrupted refinery operations and preserving thousands of jobs both within the refineries and in the support services provided by businesses in the surrounding community. The project reduces diversions from the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta thus improving ecosystem conditions. The project simultaneously beneficially reuses treated wastewater that would be discharged to the San Francisco Bay system at Suisun Bay. CCCSD modeling indicates the majority of discharge flows through the San Francisco Bay to the ocean. ","  "," ","Central Contra Costa Sanitary District ","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0"

Water Quality Improvements: A reduction in overall groundwater pumping (by offsetting groundwater use with Russian River surface water through an ASR program) can minimize the potential for saline intrusion into the Sonoma Valley groundwater basin. Additionally as the vast majority of drinking water quality parameters from the Russian River is of superior quality compared with most local groundwater sources improvements to the quality of local Sonoma Valley municipal supplies are expected. Groundwater Benefits: Conjunctively using surface water and groundwater supplies can lead to a reduction of competition among users of groundwater by supplementing groundwater supplies and thereby reducing the potential for groundwater level declines. ","Detailed description: The Sonoma Valley Groundwater Banking Program consists of the diversion and transmission of drinking water produced at the Water Agency s existing Russian River production facilities during wet weather conditions (i.e. the winter and spring seasons) for storage in the Sonoma Valley Groundwater Basin with subsequent recovery and use during dry weather conditions (i.e. the summer and fall seasons) or emergency situations. The proposed project has been studied as part of an ongoing feasibility study and several groundwater banking alternatives have been identified in Sonoma Valley. The most promising alternatives involve the use of Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) as the primary technique for banking. The proposed project also builds on and relies on the results of work completed under a previous California Department of Water Resources (DWR) Local Groundwater Assistance grant received by the Water Agency on behalf of the Basin Advisory Panel which included the construction of two nested groundwater monitoring wells and the development of a Potential Recharge Map for Sonoma Valley. The Sonoma Valley Groundwater Banking Program will be developed in an iterative phased manner comprising the following general phases: Completion of an ongoing regional Groundwater Banking Feasibility Study (for the Sonoma Valley and Santa Rosa Plain) funded by the Water Agency Valley of the Moon Water District Cities of Sonoma Cotati and Rohnert Park and Town of Windsor.An incremental pilot-scale demonstration testing program made up of three sequential steps (or Tiers) of analyses of increasing duration and complexity to fully characterize each area for aquifer recharge feasibility. Full-scale implementation of groundwater banking based on the results of the pilot-scale demonstration testing program. Phase 1 The first phase of the program (Groundwater Banking Feasibility Study) was initiated in 2010 and is scheduled for completion in Fall 2012. The ongoing Groundwater Banking Feasibility Study has included: (1) identification of primary regional considerations for framing and guiding a groundwater banking program including regional hydrogeologic conditions water quality considerations engineering considerations regulatory requirements stakeholder support and environmental issues; (2) evaluation and application of these primary considerations to rank potential methods and locations within the Sonoma Valley (and Santa Rosa Plain) for conducting groundwater banking programs; and (3) collection of surface water and groundwater samples and performance of geochemical modeling. For areas determined to be favorable for groundwater banking detailed work plans for implementing pilot-scale demonstration testing programs are under development. Phase 2 The second phase of the proposed project consists of the performance of a pilot study for ASR using existing municipal supply well(s) in Sonoma Valley California. The pilot study will collect data needed to further assess the feasibility of aquifer storage and recovery as a technique for improving groundwater management in the Sonoma Valley. Two potential pilot study locations with existing municipal water supply wells have been identified as candidates for ASR through the Groundwater Banking Feasibility Study. The wells are located within groundwater-level pumping depressions located in the El Verano Area (Valley of the Moon Water District Well No. 5) and southeast of the City of Sonoma (City of Sonoma Well No. 7). The Phase 2 pilot-scale demonstration testing program consists of three successively tiered tests. Each step builds on the empirical demonstration of feasibility of the previous tests and incrementally verifies program feasibility while allowing program assessment and modification based on field data collected during each step. Pilot Test Step Recharge Volume and Storage Period Test Duration Test Objectives Tier 1 Recharge Feasibility Test (Maximum 4 ASR cycles) Less than 75 acre-feet 4 weeks maximum storage duration Less than 6 months   Evaluate ability to recharge target aquifer and verify geochemical compatibility of native and recharged waters with aquifer mineralogy.   Assess basic aquifer recharge and hydraulic parameters (e.g. specific capacity).   Assess well efficiency for ASR operations. Tier 2 Practical Size Determination (Maximum 3 ASR cycles) Less than 300 acre-feet 3 months maximum storage duration Less than 1 year   Determine site-specific aquifer parameters (e.g. transmissivity storativity dispersion).   Demonstrate recharge of suitable quantities of water to assess practical size and parameters for full-scale system and Tier 3 pilot test.   Establish compatibility of native and recharged water over seasonal recharge/storage/recovery cycles. Tier 3 Full Scale Pilot Test (Maximum 3 ASR cycles) Less than 1200 acre-feet 1 year maximum storage duration Less than 3 years   Establish design and operating parameters for full-scale project implementation.   Evaluate rate of movement and area of influence of recharged water via groundwater model.   Verify parameters for sustained recharge of target aquifer (e.g. transmissivity storativity dispersion migration).   Establish water quality stability over long storage cycles. The proposed project would include performing an ASR pilot study on one or both of these wells which would initially involve the following Tier 1 activities: (1) several cycles of recharging and recovering between 50 and 75 acre feet of drinking water (Russian River water) into a deep confined aquifer through an existing municipal supply well; (2) extensive monitoring of water quality conditions groundwater-level responses and well efficiency throughout the pilot study; and (3) evaluation and geochemical modeling of the pilot test results. Based on the results of the Tier 1 ASR pilot study successively tiered testing would be completed to develop information needed to establish the project for full-scale implementation. Phase 3 The third phase of the proposed project consists of the development of full-scale ASR system(s) in Sonoma Valley which would be designed based on the results of the Phase 2 activities described above. Based on initial evaluation of recharge potential in Sonoma Valley and the availability of surface water from the Russian River system for recharge it is estimated that a full-scale groundwater banking program could provide between 300 and 1200 acre-feet per year depending upon the number of wells utilized for recharge. ","Project Need: The Sonoma Valley groundwater basin located in Sonoma County California has been experiencing increasing stresses on its groundwater resources in recent years due to population growth and land-use changes. The basin s water demands are met by a combination of imported water and native groundwater supplemented in recent years by recycled water and expanding water conservation programs. Groundwater meets more than half of the water demand in the Sonoma Valley with irrigation being the largest use drawing on an estimated more than 70 percent of the annual groundwater demand. The current understanding of the groundwater resources in the basin comes primarily from a study conducted by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) which was co-funded by the Water Agency to evaluate the ground water resources of the Sonoma Valley (USGS 2006) and subsequent studies and monitoring associated with implementing the GWMP. The USGS study identified two primary areas of declining groundwater levels in Sonoma Valley which are present in the El Verano area and southeast of the City of Sonoma. Subsequent monitoring and studies performed during implementation of the GWMP has better defined these areas and indicate that the declining groundwater levels are primarily associated with deeper aquifer zones in these areas (i.e. greater than 200 feet below ground surface). The USGS study also found that electrical conductivity measurements from wells located in the southern portions of Sonoma Valley exhibited increases over time potentially due to saline water intrusion and/or upwelling of geothermal waters. Groundwater levels in some these areas range up to 100 feet below sea level which can potentially cause additional saline water intrusion. The Sonoma Valley relies on groundwater and imported surface water to meet domestic agricultural and urban demands. Based on the 2006 USGS study in the year 2000 more than half the water demand was met with groundwater (57 percent) followed by imported water (36 percent) with the remaining demand met from recycled water (7 percent) and local surface water not which was not quantified. Groundwater is the primary source of supply for approximately 25 percent of the Sonoma Valley population and is the sole source of drinking water supply for rural domestic and other unincorporated areas not being served by urban suppliers. Rural domestic demand is met by groundwater extracted from privately owned and operated wells. There are also mutual water companies in the Sonoma Valley that supply domestic water to multiple households mainly with groundwater although some companies also use imported water. Agricultural water demands are largely met by Sonoma Valley groundwater supplies. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the proposal is not implemented information needed to properly scope and develop a groundwater banking program in Sonoma Valley will not be collected and the groundwater basin may be vulnerable to continued groundwater-level declines and saline intrusion.

This Project is Phase 3 of the Master Plan. The RWQCP recently completed a Long Range Facilities Plan (Summer 2012) that included the Palo Alto Recycled Water Project. (2) The City of Palo Alto is one of 26 agencies that purchase potable water from the San Francisco Regional Water System. The Bay Area Water Supply and Conservation Agency (BAWSCA) represents the interests of the 26 agencies before the SFPUC. The BAWSCA members are projecting a future need for both normal and dry year supplies. In response the BAWSCA agencies prepared a Long Term Reliable Water Supply Strategy in July 2009. The Palo Alto Recycled Water Project was identified as a project with near term implementation potential and is currently identified in the Phase IIa Final Report (July 2012). (3) The City of Palo Alto is a member of the Bay Area Recycled Water Coalition (BARWC). BARWC is an independent group of agencies in the San Francisco Bay Area that advocates for recycled water programs and seeks federal funding through Title 16. (4) The Santa Clara Valley Water District recently prepared a Water Supply and Infrastructure Master Plan (WSIMP). The WSIMP s goal is to meet future normal and dry year needs in Santa Clara County. The City of Palo Alto was an active participant and stakeholder during preparation of the WSIMP. The WSIMP s baseline elements include increasing recycled water use by 14000 AF. The new elements in the strategy includes development of an additional 20000 AF of indirect potable reuse supplies. The Palo Alto Recycled Water project is an integral part of both the baseline and new supply elements. ","Project Need: i. Water Supply Need: The City currently relies primarily on imported water from SFPUC to meet demands. While the City receives adequate potable water supply on average availability of imported water from SFPUC could diminish over time because of droughts climate change effects or regulatory actions which could reduce the potable water supply for the City in the long term. The City can improve water supply reliability by taking steps locally to manage water demand by providing supplemental water sources such as the proposed recycled water project. The project will provide a dependable locally controlled non-potable water source that will be available even in droughts to serve irrigation and other non-potable uses. The primary need for extending recycled water pipelines into Palo Alto will be to allow the City to maximize recycled water as a supplemental water source and offset potable water for higher quality use. ii. Ability to Reduce Water Demand and/or Water Supply: The project will directly supply 900 AFY of recycled water to meet outdoor irrigation needs and conserve an equivalent amount of potable water for higher quality uses (e.g. drinking water). Thus the project will reduce water demand on high-quality potable water but at the same time provide a sustainable long-term supply for customers with outdoor landscapes. The risk of droughts now and in the future is high in California. Because of this risk rationing and potentially outright limiting potable water for uses that do not require high quality drinking water such as landscape irrigation toilet flushing cooling towers and other uses for non-potable water could occur in the City. The provision of recycled water will sustain landscape value during droughts when potable water use is restricted because it will deliver a reliable recycled water source. In summary the Project will also improve potable water supply reliability by conserving drinking water. iii. Resource Stewardship Need: One of the objectives of the RWQCB Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Basin is to protect San Francisco Bay from degradation. The proposed Project will redirect treated effluent of the RWQCP from the San Francisco Bay to existing customers for landscape irrigation. Thus the Project will conserve the San Francisco Bay by reducing the wastewater constituent mass loadings to the Bay and enhancing preservation of salt water marshland habitats. In addition by providing a sustainable alternative water supply to customers for their use in landscape irrigation the City is protecting and enhancing its urban forest particularly during periods of droughts when mandatory rationing will restrict outdoor water use. The urban forest is highly valued asset in the City. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the Project is not implemented the City of Palo Alto will continue to import over 900 AFY of Hetch Hetchy potable water supplies for irrigation purposes. Although the Hetch Hetchy currently provides an adequate supply of potable water for both drinking water and irrigation purposes that supply could diminish over time because of droughts climate change effects or regulatory actions. As discussed above the risk of drought in the future is high and rationing and potentially outright limiting potable water for uses that do not require high quality drinking water could occur in the City (for commercial and industrial uses). The lack of potable water supply for landscape irrigation could lead to degradation of plant health and changes in the visual quality of the environment if such restrictions were to extend over long periods of time affecting the City s urban forest (the urban forest is made up of both City protected and non-protected trees). The lack of a sustainable supply for other non-potable uses (e.g. toilet flushing) could result in a health and safety concern. The continued importation of water will require energy usage which is associated with the emission of greenhouse gas emissions. There will be no opportunity to reduce climate-change related effects if the project were not implemented. Since the project is designed in such a way to allow future interconnections with neighboring communities these communities (including East Palo Alto) will not have additional future supply options. The RWQCP will continue to discharge over 900 AFY of treated wastewater into San Francisco Bay and will not reduce the net input of chemical constituents entering the Bay if this program to reuse water is not implemented. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) The project will provide over 900 AFY of recycled water for irrigation and in the future potentially industrial use such as toilet flushing and commercial and light industrial cooling towers. This will offset almost 900 AFY of potable water purchases from the SFPUC which can be redirected for other beneficial uses. The cost of SFPUC purchased water continues to rise dramatically. The project will save the City over $1 million in purchased water costs in 2015 rising to over $2 million by 2021. The project will also diversify the City of Palo Alto's supply portfolio and provide a drought proof supply of water for the future irrigation and industrial needs. Typically landscape customers are the first casualty when mandatory water cutbacks are imposed. Recycled water is a sustainable supply that would offset effects that could otherwise occur after prolonged droughts. Thus the proposed Project will benefit protected trees non-protected trees and other vegetation present in existing landscapes that make up the urban forest and contribute to the greenery of the City. The use of recycled water will free up precious potable supplies for other uses including transfers to other agencies in need of additional supplies to meet population and economic growth. The development of a robust recycled water program including distribution infrastructure and capital investments at the RWQCP is an initial step in the development of an indirect potable reuse program. ii. Water Quality With the implementation of this project RWQCP and its Partners will reduce the wastewater constituent mass loadings to the San Francisco Bay and will provide long-term environmental and economic benefits to the community. The project could include collaboration with other agencies to reduce current salinity levels to improve water quality. Improvements in water quality will improve recycled water distribution and acceptance. ","  "," ","City of Palo Alto ","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0"
"276 ","EBMUD - Pretreatment Facilities ","EBMUD's primary operating configuration involves treatment of high quality Mokelumne River water at its in-line treatment plants. Treatment of lesser quality supplemental supply sources is not possible at the in-line plants as currently configured. Pretreatment facilities constructed at one or more in-line plants would greatly enhance EBMUD's water treatment flexibility and potentially offer greater opportunities to treat and convey water to other agencies via interties. ","('East Bay';) | Contra Costa "," ","Once grant funds secured "," "," ","Project Type Description: Drinking Water Supply - Pretreatment improvements at the Walnut Creek WTP provides flexibility to treat raw waters with a greater range of initial quality increasing the amount of water that can be treated from both Mokelumne and non-Mokelumne water sources. These additional treated supplies could be made available to other water agencies. Water Quality Improvement - Pretreatment facilities would allow greater flexibility in the treatment of Mokelumne water especially if initial water quality were to degrade due to issues at Pardee Reservoir. ","Detailed description: Installation of pretreatment facilities at EBMUD's Walnut Creek Water Treatment Plant (WCWTP) would provide greater flexibility to treat raw water of varying sources and qualities. The WCWTP is one of 3 in-line water treatment plants operated by EBMUD. It treats high quality raw water from Pardee Reservoir conveyed by aqueducts to WCWTP. The addition of pretreatment systems at WCWTP have been contemplated for many years to allow the treatment of Pardee water that experiences excursions of reduced raw water quality from time to time. As part of the WCWTP Improvement Project of 2001 accommodations were made at the WCWTP to allow the future installation of pretreamtment systems. Since 2001 EBMUD has successfully partnered with the Sacramento County Water Agency (SCWA) to construct the Freeport Regional Water Project (FRWP). The FRWP via water contracts with the US Bureau of Reclamation provides supplemental supply when EBMUD's normal Mokelumne supply runs low. The FRWP also offers opportunities to contract with neighboring water agencies to convey 'transfer water' through EBMUD's distribution system to them via interties. As well an intertie on EBMUD's raw water system with the Contra Costa Water District (CCWD) could provide opportunities for EBMUD to store water at Los Vaqueros (LV) Reservoir and treat and convey water to neighoboring agencies to improve water supply reliability for the Bay Area. Another potential project under investigation currently is the use of LV optimize to water produced at a future Regional Desalination facility. One key restriction of the current system to treat and convey water for the benefit of neighboring agencies is the lack of suitable facilities at WCWTP that are capable of treating raw water from sources with higher than Mokelumne organic loading. This project would investigate the installation of facilities at WCWTP to treat waters other than Mokelumne water. Membrane Filtraton is the most likely process to meet the given treatment objective however pilot testing will be necessary for proper process/equipment selection. ","Project Need: Pretreatment facilities will address the following needs: Normal year raw water supply from Pardee Reservoir experiences water quality excursions periodically from increased organic loading primarily. Pretreatment will allow EBMUD the flexibility to treat this water at the WCWTP instead of being sent to EBMUD's terminal reservoirs (USL and San Pablo) for more expensive conventional treatment. Neighboring agencies have approached EBMUD to explore the concept of conveying and treating raw water for delivery to them via new or existing interties. These agencies water supplies in normal and dry years primarily due to limitations to deliver water through Delta facilities. The source water used for this purpose would most likely be from the Sacramento River and of reduced quality versus Pardee supply. In order to treat this supply pretreatment systems are needed. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: It is too speculative to predict what critical impacts will occur if this proposal is not implemented. This is an opportunity to provide needed water supply to neighboring agencies. Failure to implement the proposal may be viewed as a lost opportunity. Adding pretreatment to EBMUD's treatment facilities further enhances the concept of regional reliability among water agencies. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) This project will allow greater flexibility for EBMUD to treat raw water sources of varying water qualities for the benefit of EBMUD and other Bay Area agencies who could receive treated water wheeled through EBMUD's distribution system and interties. Adding pretreatment to EBMUD's treatment facilities further enhances the concept of regional water reliability including opportunities to increase local groundwater conjunctive storage projects. ii.

","Detailed description: Bayside Groundwater Project Phase 2 is an Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) Project that expands on an existing operation (EBMUD's Bayside Groundwater Project Phase 1). Note that the SEBP Basin is located in EBMUD's south western service area. Treated water (as accessed from EBMUD's potable water distribution system) is to be injected (via wells that will be constructed) into the South East Bay Plain (SEBP) Groundwater Basin during periods when water is available for storage (e.g.  wet years) for extraction (recovery) during times of drought. Combined with existing Phase 1 opertations this expanded project would serve as a 10 mgd supplemental supply source for EBMUD.

","Project Need: EBMUD has a need to develop additional supplemental supplies to address shortfalls during times of drought. EBMUD's need for water is anticipated to increase over time (reference = EBMUD's Water Supply Management Program 2040). EBMUD's existing source of supply (the Mokelumne River) is limited during times of drought due to low flow conditions. Coupled with increase uses of Mokelumne River water by senior water rights holders EBMUD anticipates a continuing need to develop additonal sources of dry year water supply.

"280 ","City of Berkeley Watershed Management Plan ","The City of Berkeley Watershed Mangement Plan (WMP) takes a comprehensive and holistic approach to establishing a healthier balance between the urban environment and the natural ecosystems. Toward this end the WMP includes recommendations for enhancing and improving City efforts to meet the goals of: water quality protection; urban flooding reduction; natural waterways and habitat preservation and restoration; and promotion of the re-use of rainwater as a resource. There are currently 54 identified projects within the Berkeley Watershed Master Plan.

The Potter and Codornices Watersheds were selected because they represent the full range of the urban drainage spectrum in Berkeley. The Potter Watershed drains approximately 1/3 of the land area of the City and the Codornices Watershed drains about 1/10 of the City. ","Project Type Description: Water Quality Improvements: control and remove sediment by controling stormwater flows and erosive velocities; Stormwater Improvements: control flood waters and erosion damage; Habitat Protection and Restoration: protect and restore existing habitat for endangered and protective species(including existing salmon populations)and recreation activities in Aquatic Park; Flood Protection: protect existing urban areas by controling chronic flooding conditions including Aquatic Park and San Francisco Bay; and Related to Disadvantaged Community: a portion of the flood protection provided by these projects protect chronic flood prone areas located within disadvantaged community areas within the City of Berkeley. ","Detailed description: The Watershed Managemant Plan (WMP) presents an integrated and sustainable strategy for managing urban water resources. It is meant to guide future City efforts in promoting a healthier balance between the urban environment and the natural ecosystem. The document is arranged by various topic areas providing an overview of current City activities and making recommendations for improvements. The WMP should be considered a document that will evolve over time as new information is gathered and analyzed technologies advance and regulatory requirements change. Berkeley is a densely built-out city comprised of 11 watersheds wholly or partially within City limits. All watersheds in Berkeley eventually drain to the San Francisco Bay which is an important economic engine and an internationally recognized natural resource. Each watershed is unique with various mixtures of: land uses demographic communities and remaining aquatic and wildlife habitats. Chapter 2 provides an overview of watershed characteristics as well as common issues associated with urban settings. These issues include high rates and volumes of stormwater runoff (flooding) stormwater pollution and degradation of creeks. The WMP looks at addressing water quality flooding and the preservation of creeks and habitats using multi-objective approaches where possible. This entails supplementing the existing engineering storm drain infrastructure with greener approaches that mimic natural hydrologic processes including filtration and infiltration by solid and plants. Chapter 3 discusses various green retrofit measures appropriate for the public right-of-way as well as for public and private property. These green approaches also provide opportunities for the collection and non-potable re-use of stormwater. Additional discussion of water quality programs and recommendations are provided in Chapter 4. There are an estimated 8 miles of open creeks in the City. Only 7% of this is on public lands the remainder flows through private properties. There are about 6.5 miles of creek culverts with about 60% on public property. There is little data available on the physical conditions of both creeks and creek culverts thus one of the primary recommendations for additional information gathering. Further discussion of the benefits functions and associated habitats of creeks is provided in Chapter 5 which also articulates the City's regulatory roles and the distinction between creek culverts and storm drainpipes. There are about 93 miles of storm drain pipelines under the public right-of-way throughout the City much of which is nearing or past its design life expectancy. Chapter 6 discusses the public storm drain pipe infrastructure and how the City approaches its management. Additional information gathering is needed to assess the physical conditions and hydraulic capacities of these facilities. Maintenance programs are further discussed in Chapter 7. For WMP development City Council approved funding for the hydraulic modeling of the Potter and Codorinices Watersheds (Chapter 8). These two watersheds represent the full range of the drainage spectrum in Berkeley. The Codorinices Watershed is drained by one of the most open creeks remaining in the East Bay while the Potter Watershed (the largest in the City) is drained exclusively by storm drain pipes. The modeling results were used to develop Capitol Improvement recommendations for both watersheds. These recommendations call for an innovative combination of conventional measures (such as pipe enlargement) and green right-of-way retrofits to treat slow and potentially re-use stormwater. These measures called Green Infrastructure include right-of-way landscaping underground temporary storage piping permeable surfacing and trash capture devices. Implementing WMP recommendation will require coordination among City Departments; participation and support from the public; partnerships with stakeholders; gathering and analyses of information; and financial resources. Chapter 9 provides four funding scenarios with a corresponding level of WMP implementation associated for each. ","Project Need: The mission of the Watershed Management Plan (WMP) is to promote a healthier balance between the urban environment and the natural ecosystem including the San Francisco Bay. The WMP serves to guide the development enhancement and implementation of specific actions and improvements that will help to provide much needed flood protection in the lower areas of the City and improve water quality by controlling erosion and other sources of sediment within the project areas. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the two recommended projects in the Watershed Master Plan are not completed large amounts of sediments from natural erosion in the upper watershed areas will continue to clog Codornices and Potter Creeks and undetained storm flows will continue to cause chronic flooding problems in the City's Western areas which impact water quality and continued degradation of habitat throughout including disadvantages community areas in the City of Berkeley.

","Detailed description: The Dublin San Ramon Services District's (DSRSD) Recycled Water Distribution and Retrofit for County and Federal Facilities project will build on and expand the Central Dublin Recycled Water Distribution Expansion project to deliver 550 acre-feet per year of recycled water in its service area. The Recycled Water Distribution and Retrofit for County and Federal Facilities Project will expand DSRSD's existing recycled water distribution system to deliver up to 551 acre-feet per year (AFA) of recycled water to large county and federal institutional customers within the DSRSD service area. This Project entails constructing recycled water distribution pipelines to convey water for landscape irrigation to sites which include a military base a federal prison a county cail and a county judicial center. Future plans for the military base include privatization of approx 190 acres and development of that area. This project will make Recycled Water available to that privatized area. The pipeline routes for this infrastructure are now being studied; but will be extended from existing RW pipelines. This Project will also provide plumbing retrofits to connect existing irrigation systems at the federal and county facilities to the recycled water system. Approximately 551 Acre-feet of Recycled Water per year will be used at full development of the project displacing a similar amount of potable water currently used for irrigation. ","Project Need: This Project will reduce/postpone development of new or expanded water supplies and will replace potable water currently used for irrigation and construction. The recycled water supply would also offset the water supply provided by Zone 7 Water Agency (Zone 7) from the State Water Project (SWP) which would consequently reduce diversions reduce groundwater extraction and reduce energy use (by reduced pumping). The expanded use of recycled water would also reduce the burden on existing Federal water supply facilities such as the Central Valley Project (CVP). The SWP and CVP water contract allocations are closely inter-connected and the supply of recycled water would reduce demand and utilization of those valuable drinking water resources. Recycled Water is a drought resistant supply available all year long and can be stored in facilities already built. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Without this project there will be additional demands on the potable supplies provided by the State Water Project and the regional ground water basin. Thus DSRSD's water supply will be more reliant on the already stressed water resources. DSRSD's water supply will become less reliable in the future with less flexibility and less able to meet additional demands from continued development in our service area. Economic development in our service area will be stunted by the lack of reliable water supply. DSRSD's customers and regional customers will face their water supplies being reduced; with their water bills increasing. In the event of a state-wide drought increased pressure will be placed on the regional ground water basin; with the potential of salt water encroachment on the basin now used for potable storage. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality ... iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) This project will help make Recycled Water available to more customers for landscape irrigation to replace potable water former used for irrigation in already established areas of the city of Dublin. The project wil help expand a successful DERWA joint venture (DSRSD and EBMUD) bringing recycled water to new areas for additional conservation of our potable resources. The use of recycled water by these customers will reduce irrigation with potable water by 551 AF per year. This project helps expand a project that stretches the potable water supply of the Bay/Delta region by replacing some of the potable water from the State Water Project now used for irrigation with recycled water from DSRSD's WWTP. Also drop for drop recycled water used for irrigation is that much less water that has to be pumped out to be disposed of in San Francisco Bay. So the project will result in 551 AF per year LESS of WWTP effluent disposed of in the Bay and the corresponding decrease in electrical energy consumption needed to pump those volumes from the Tri-Valley area to the Bay. By reducing potable consumption this project will help DSRSD as a Water Retailer meet the 20% by 2020 potable water reduction requirements set by state law. It will also serve as a demonstration project for the beneficial uses of Recycled Water to area residents. With this successful project underway DSRSD and DERWA will be able to bring additional Recycled Water projects to the Tri-Valley area for implementation.

The 350 Home and Garden Challenge is a community-wide challenge which inspires collaborative action and creates public and private models which conserve and reuse water save energy and grow food. Our planned expansion of this program involves the following: deepen our impact in local watersheds; further develop the 350 Challenge model and toolkit; provide technical and financial support and coordination for the replication of this program throughout the Bay Area. ","('North Bay'; 'East Bay'; 'South Bay'; 'West Bay') | Sonoma; Marin; Napa; Contra Costa; Alameda; San Francisco "," ","07/1/13 ","9/30/15 "," ","Project Type Description: The 350 Home and Garden Challenge provides resources education and implementations support which inspires action in each of the following areas. Drinking Water Supply: Promotion of water conservation practices such as lawn transformation and greywater use and rainwater catchment. Water Quality Improvement: Promotion of organic landscape practices that reduce use of toxic pesticides and herbicides. Water Reuse/Recycling: Installation of greywater systems. Stormwater Improvements: Installation of rain gardens and bioswales promotion of downspout disconnection and promotion of landscape practices that build soil and reduce runoff. Groundwater Benefits: Above-mentioned stormwater improvements to also recharge groundwater and reduce toxins in our watersheds. Infiltration: Promotion of above mentioned practices which increase onsite infiltration at model public and private landscapes. Habitat Protection and Restoration: Promotion of practices and creation of model projects which emphasize planting native and beneficial plants which create and enhance ecosystem function in home and neighborhood landscapes. Flood Protection: Using above practices and strategies such as rain gardens to decrease runoff and increase infiltration of stormwater. Related to DAC: We will be targeting projects and groups in disadvantaged communities and providing technical and financial support. ","Detailed description: Our core concept is the expansion of a proven program that inspires significant citizen action and diverse stakeholder collaboration towards achieving multiple IRWMP goals while creating public and private examples of sustainability and integrated water management. Over three years in Sonoma County the 350 Challenge has inspired over 3000 home and garden actions; the creation of dozens of model projects and over 30 media features on local partners and projects to name a few impacts. One outcome includes registered projects resulting in over 200000 square feet of turf transformation. In 2013-2014 we will: deepen the impact of the 350 Home and Garden Challenge in the North Bay Region specifically in the Petaluma River and Sonoma Creek Watersheds; refine our 350 Challenge Toolkit; provide further training and support to groups already implementing the program in Marin Contra Costa and Alameda counties; recruit train and provide support to new groups in the other 5 bay area counties. In 2014-2015 we will: provide assistance technical support and advanced training to partner organizations in the Bay Area to build upon the previous year s success while gathering data to assess impacts of model delivery to communities. In building up to the 350 Challenge weekend Daily Acts and partner groups will conduct educational and skill-building workshops events and tours in addition to soliciting model projects. We will work with water agencies resource conservation districts and community partners to transform public lawns into model water-wise landscapes; and to inspire and train citizens to transform water-intensive lawns install greywater systems rainwater catchment systems and rain gardens. In the process we will promote the use of local water conservation incentive programs and share innovative programs we have developed. One such example are the citizen-powered greywater system installation programs we have worked with the cities of Petaluma Cotati and Santa Rosa on recently resulting in the largest greywater installation course in the U.S. with 27 greywater systems being installed in one weekend. ","Project Need: Citizens and agencies are easily overwhelmed by the scale of social environmental and economic challenges we face. One easy to overlook answer to this is the power of lots of small and integrated solutions. By focusing on thousands of citizen-powered actions in a way that aligns non-profit business and government agencies we achieve big results in an affordable way that empowers citizens utilizes existing conservation and stormwater programs and resources and strengthens our collaborative fiber. What this results in is thousands of citizens educated and engaged through tours workshops installations and media features. It results in greater household water conservation and use of local conservation programs. it results in more rain gardens greywater systems and cisterns installed saving water infiltrating stormwater and providing emergency water supply. By creating and promoting integrated landscapes which provide a diversity of benefits while mimicking ecosystem function it results in more resilient gardens households and neighborhoods. All of this leads to a positive cycle of behavior change and engagement. In a decade of running these programs and three years of the 350 Challenge we have seen a significant degree of the objectives met in many of the IRWMP goals and we've received requests from non-profits throughout the Bay Area to collaborate and implement this program. This has led us from installing one greywater system to nearly 100 greywater systems and from sheet mulching one public lawn to working with the City of Petaluma which has now provided resources to sheet mulch 400000 square feet of turf saving millions of gallons of water a year. A vital need this project addresses is for citizen-powered actions that are collaborative and catalyze movement towards implementing integrated water solutions at scale. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Based upon actual registered actions and projects in Sonoma County and Contra Costa County for the 2012 350 Home and Garden Challenge we estimate the following critical impacts if this program is not implemented: thousands of citizens across the Bay Area will not be engaged and educated about water conservation and stormwater practices they can implement at home and local programs they can utilize; over 100 local projects to sheet mulch lawns install rain gardens rainwater catchment systems and greywater systems will not happen; dozens of groups in each county will miss a community-wide opportunity to collaborate; dozens of media features which reach millions of readers educating them about these programs models and actions will not occur. All of this will result in a less aware empowered and engaged citizenry a less connected and integrated group of community agencies less actual on the ground models of sustainability and integrated water management from backyards and front yards to city hall. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply: For every laundry to landscape system installed 5-8 thousand gallons of water are reused in landscape irrigation. Greywater system installation also allows this water to be recharged into our ground water basins reconnecting people and their homes to their watershed. Additionally we have consistently observed that utilizing greywater leads to other conservation practices in peoples homes. For each square foot of lawn transformed there is an annual water savings of 25 gallons per square foot in addition to the reduction in pesticide and herbicide use. In 2012 alone the 350 Home and Garden Challenge transformed 95717 sq ft of lawn saving an estimated 1000000 + gallons of water annually. So far in 2012 over 85 greywater systems have been registered from our educational installation workshops which will save approximately 500000 gallons of water per year. For every 1000 sq ft of roof utilized in rainwater catchment up to 600 gallons of water is saved per inch of rainfall. Through implementing a diversity of water harvesting strategies there is the potential to use and recharge 14400 gallons of water each year. Additionally when residents apply these techniques they often become much more engaged and share their models with neighbors friends and coworkers creating a multiplier effect. ii. Water Quality: In addition to the direct impacts to conservation and supply the techniques described above directly impact water quality reducing use of toxic products such as pesticides and herbicides. Additionally with greywater systems residents are recommended to utilize cleaning agents that are biodegradable non toxic and free of sodium and boron. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Through this program we educate citizens about rain gardens and redirecting roof and site runoff and how to build healthy; we provide installation workshops at model sites in each community. This has a lasting impact beyond just flood and stormwater management by creating ongoing opportunities to educate hundreds of neighbors friends and community members at each site. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) By being involved in these programs and experiencing a more holistic and integrated way to solve our resource problems people become more empowered and proactively engaged. They link up with other people and groups with shared interests which sustains their engagement. ","  "," ","Daily Acts ","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1"

Four distinct types of streets: minor residential residential collector and arterial will be retrofitted with bioretention rain gardens tree well filters and/or will replace hardscpae with permeable surfaces to demonstrate how to reduce overall impervious surfaces and provide treatment and infiltration of runoff while maintaing the primary function of the existing street. In many instances the LID features will be integrated into traffic calming and streetscape improvements for pedestrians and cyclists.

","Detailed description: The San Jose Green Streets Demonstration project will construct Low Impact Development features on up to four different types of street each in a specific urban setting to demonstrate a range of approaches for retrofitting existing streets for stormwater treatment and flow reduction. Each project will measure the pollutant removal and flow reduction performance of its specific LID features by conducting pre- and post-project water monitoring. Four distinct types of streets: minor residential residential neighborhood collector and arterial will be retrofitted with bioretention rain gardens and permeable surfaces to reduce impervious surfaces provide treatment and infiltration of runoff and to calm traffic and improve the streetscape for pedestrians and cyclists. This suite of individual projects will serve as a comprehensive demonstration of retrofits of the most common types of streets in the Bay Area and will demonstrate the integration of LID features across a range of land uses settings and street morphologies. The projects individually and together will provide design examples that any city can apply to its own streets. Each project will include education features and use grand opening/project completion events to publicize the connection between urban runoff and the health of local waters and the Bay. Each of four LID street retrofits proposed within the overall project have a conceptual design already completed. Each aims to reduce impervious surfaces and create bioretention rain gardens in its place by eliminating unnecessary paved medians and shoulders. Permeable pavers will be used to increase permeability. The projects use bioretention rain gardens constructed slightly below the grade of the travel lanes to intercept and retain runoff. The rain gardens will be planted with California native and adapted plants chosen for their low irrigation requirements pest resistance and proven performance in rain gardens. San Jose will pursue Bay Friendly certification for the projects' landscape design and maintenance. Numerous studies show that bioretention is the most effective and cost efficient methods of treating runoff from roads and other urban areas and this project will demonstrate how to achieve effective management of stormwater from existing streets through LID retrofits. ","Project Need: Nearly all public streets in the Bay Area contribute untreated stormwater runoff to local waterways and in turn to San Francisco Bay. The absence of stormwater management features on the region's roadways allows pollutants and increased flows from roads to degrade water quality and adversely impact stream morphology. The EPA`s \"Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff\" identifies primary urban runoff pollutants as sediment sediment-bound pollutants such as heavy metals PCBs and pesticides and hydrocarbons and oil and grease from motor vehicles. These pollutants can harm fish and wildlife kill native vegetation foul drinking water and make recreational areas unsafe and unpleasant. The San Jose Green Streets Project uses Low Impact Development (LID) methods proven to reduce the overall volume of runoff and to provide treatment to previously untreated flows. The projects' LID features include bioretention rain gardens tree well filters and permable pavement that will filter and infiltrate runoff to reduce stormwater pollutants. The replacement of existing hardscape with permeable pavement will further reduce surface runoff volumes by reducing the effective impervious area. Retrofitting the region's roads to treat their stormwater runoff will provide a significant tangible water quality benefit. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The project benefits water quality over the long term by providing bioretention treatment to untreated street runoff to remove sediment and other pollutants of concern. The project area drains untreated runoff to the storm drains which discharge to the Guadalupe River. The San Francisco Bay Water Quality Control Board has identified the Guadalupe River as a priority watershed due to water quality impairment from urban runoff and other pollutants. Direct impairments in the Guadalupe Watershed include CWA Section 303(d)-listed Mercury Pesticide Toxicity and Trash. TMDLs have been established for Mercury and Pesticide. Additionally hydrology impacts from increased flows during intense storms affect the natural channel morphology impacting freshwater habitat for wildlife and fish migration and spawning and can concentrate trash and sediment-bound urban pollutants (PCBs copper zinc lead mercury pesticides and hydrocarbons) in the River. If the project is not implemented these conditions will not be addressed and examples of Low Impact Development stormwater managment features on a range of the most common public streets will not be available for future retrofit opportunities throughout the watershed. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) ... ii. Water Quality The project will benefit water quality by providing bioretention treatment and allowing infiltration of untreated street runoff to remove sediment and other pollutants of concern thus reducing flow and pollutant loads to downstream water bodies. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management The project will benefit stormwater management and to some extent flood control by detaining filtering and infiltrating stormwater runoff from public streets by retrofitting them with Low Impact Development stormwater management features. Based on preliminary designs for that four projects the would comprise the San Jose Green Streets Demonstration project the projects will collectively reduce impervious surfaces by over 55000 square feet (1.3 acres) and create up to 32500 square feet of biorention rain gardens to treat runoff. iv.

","Project Need: Rangelands habitats in California provide essential ecosystem services such as wildlife habitat  healthy watersheds and carbon sequestration. Rangelands are being converted to other uses mainly urbanization and intensive agriculture habitats are being lost and fragmented and the ecological processes that made possible the provision of ecosystem services are being lost. Rangelands are essential in capturing and filtering water and releasing it slowly so it can be used for other uses. As every acre of rangeland is converted that capacity is lost. Costly infrastructure will be needed to maintain water supplies and quality. Investing in rangeland cosnervation makes sense. Ranchers are interested in providing ecosystem services provided that there are incentives for them to do so. Additional funding for easements and conservation practices will help protect and restore rangeland habitats and all the ecosystem services that they provide. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Rangeland habitats will keep being converted and watersheds impaired. Surface water and recharge will decrease and runoff will increase. The ability of rangeland soils to sequester carbon will be lost exacerbating climate change.

This wider channel will reduce channel erosion and will improve water quality by reducing fine sediment inputs resulting from bank collapse. Habitat protection and restoration will will be accomplished by directly creating 48 acres of new riparian and aquatic habitat from uplands and farmland and improving tributary habitat by reducing the progression of upstream incision and bank collapse. Restoration actions that setback eroding banks and create floodplains along the river channel will accomplish flood protection by reducing the velocity and intensity of flows in the river channel. ","Detailed description: The Napa River is one of the only large watersheds in the San Francisco Bay Area which remains in a rural state. The Napa River has been rated as one of five anchor watersheds for salmonid habitat restoration (CEMAR 2006). With agricultural uses protected and urbanization limited by local zoning the Napa River has the potential for restoration with long-term benefits to riparian and aquatic habitats. Steelhead trout and Chinook salmon spawn and rear in the drainage with Chinook primarily using the river channel. In 2007 the California Land Stewardship Institute (CLSI) received funding from the California State Water Resources Control Board and Napa County (Measure A) to prepare a habitat enhancement and water quality improvement plan for nine miles of the Napa River between the Oakville Cross Road Bridge and the Oak Knoll Avenue Bridge. The Oakville to Oak Knoll Reach suffers from channel incision with bank collapse erosion of (riffles bars pools important to salmonids and a reduced riparian corridor due to the lack of a functional floodplain. As the river erodes its bed and deepens the 25 foot banks collapse directly contributing fine sediment to the river and impairing beneficial uses. The incision of the main river channel is now progressing up tributaries increasing erosion and loss of habitat. There are four large municipal dams on major tributaries to the Napa River. Dams block sediment movement and release flood water that has a greater capacity to erode the river channel. At the Yountville cross road in the middle of the project reach over 50% of the watershed of the Napa River is behind one of these four large dams. The dams affect the supply of spawning gravel and channel erosion. Additionally prior to settlement parts of the project area of the Napa River were dominated by wetlands fed by distributary channels from alluvial fans on tributaries. Over time the distributary channels were converted to more efficient drainage channels and the wetlands were drained and farmed. Removal of vegetation and gravel bars elimination of multiple river channels and riprap bank stabilization also took place along the mainstem. Extensive data collection fieldwork and analysis informed the final concept plan. LIDAR topographic data for the Napa River from Napa County was collected and 103 cross-sections across the Napa River from bank top to bank top were surveyed. Geomorphic features were mapped using a combination of handheld GPS and mapping directly onto topographic base maps. Changes in the width and form of the channel the loss of secondary channels changes in the amount of exposed gravel and the width of the riparian corridor were reviewed on historic aerial photographs. A riparian ecosystem assessment was completed by defining geomorphic units for mapping vegetation mapping riparian vegetation by species and size class and analyzing biodiversity size class dominance and successional stages. The relative number of the four size classes and distribution of size classes over different morphological areas in the corridor indicate regeneration level and ecological successional processes. The mapping found that in a number of locations there was little to no regeneration of riparian growth largely due to the incision in the channel and the high velocity flows. A fish habitat assessment was also completed. There are 29 native and 22 non-native fish species that occur in the freshwater and brackish habitats of the Napa River basin. Habitat typing surveys were conducted in accordance with the methodology presented in the California Salmonid Stream Habitat Restoration Manual. The restoration plan will widen the river channel and re create floodplains and secondary channels in select locations giving the Napa River a morphology closer to its pre settlement condition. By widening the river channel and restoring floodplains ecological processes can create a diverse set of habitats including salmon habitat and reduce erosion of the river channel. Restoration areas are structured in four large nodes where large areas of a variety of habitats will be created. The Oakville node is in an area where the river channel is already wide and has a diverse set of habitats. a 6.8 acre set of restoration areas will reduce bank erosion and create 4.2 acres of new riparian floodplain. the Yountville node encompasses approximately 53 acres and will create new floodplain wetlands set back eroding banks and recreate wetland/upland habitat complexes. The Old Hopper Creek habitat node encompasses 30 acres and will restore secondary channels setback eroding banks. recreate riparian floodplains and wetlands. Restoration at the Oak Knoll node will focus on the confluence of Dry Creek and the Napa River and restore 7.7 acres of riparian floodplain and secondary channels. Much of the restoration will be carried out on private land where landowners have set aside a portion of their property for restoration. Areas of the Napa River Ecological Reserve dominated by non-native invasive plants will also be restored. In total implementation of the Oakville to Oak Knoll restoration project will cover 97 acres and create 80.6 acres of new riparian and channel habitats. Additionally a total of 865000 cubic yards of fine sediment will be graded from locations where it can erode and become a pollutant providing a major water quality improvement. Napa County has began the environmental review and permitting for the Oakville to Oak Knoll Plan in September 2011 with funds from the Environmental Protection Agency and Napa County Measure A. Arundo donax removal from the upper 4 miles of the reach has also been funded and is underway. Napa County has also started final design for approximately half of the restoration area and will complete design in 2013. ","Project Need: The Oakville to Oak Knoll project fulfills a need to provide high quality anadromous fish habitat in a watershed with the physical features to sustain this habitat over time and thus contribute to the recovery of these listed species. Both steelhead trout and Chinook salmon inhabit the Napa River and will benefit from this project. There are few watersheds in the SF Bay Area that are not urban and have the features needed to sustain productive salmonid habitats. The Napa River watershed is primarily rural and agricultural and as such retains near natural processes of infiltration and runoff. The proposed project will create large areas of the habitats needed for recovery of these species. The project will focus on a sustainable approach to river restoration by making changes that allow for natural geomorphic processes and ecological succession processes. This project also fulfills a need to implement the fine sediment TMDL for the Napa River to improve water quality in the river and San Pablo bay. The TMDL identifies channel erosion as a major source of loading and this project will significantly reduce this source while also enhancing and creating habitat for listed salmonids and numerous other wildlife species. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: The effects of the incision of the main river channel will continue to progress up tributaries increasing erosion and loss of habitat and exacerbating water quality problems. Threatened and endangered species will continue to decline. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.): By widening the river channel and slowing the velocity of the flow groundwater recharge will increase. ii. Water Quality: Reduction in fine sediment delivery The project will provide a major improvement in water quality. A total of 865000 cubic yards of fine sediment will be graded from locations where it can erode and become a pollutant. The Napa River TMDL for fine sediment identifies channel erosion as a major source of this pollutant and recommends channel widening and floodplain creation to reduce this source of sediment. This project would provide for needed improvements in water quality. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management: Reduction in the intensity and velocity of large flood events Widening the channel will slow flood flows for the 2 and possibly 5 year frequency flood events. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.): This project involves numerous private agricultural and residential landowners who are willingly dedicating land to the restoration effort. In addition this project will restore portions of the Napa River Ecological Reserve that are currently dominated with invasive non-native species and no longer providing native habitats for fish and wildlife. As part of the project a Benefit Assessment District is proposed that will provide funds to the Napa County Flood Control District to manage both the created habitat areas and existing habitat areas along the 9 mile river reach and remove invasive non native palnts and repair bank erosion sites while maintaining large wood in the channel. Additionally a Technical Advisory Group of agencies landowners local environmental groups and scientists will over see the project design and increase their knowledge of large scale restoration projects.

The purpose of the project is to add recycled water capacity at the Sewerage Agency of Southern Marin (SASM) and includes expanding the SASM treatment plant to produce tertiary recycled water and irrigate nearby facilities that currently use potable water. Project lead will be Marin Municipal Water District; partners include SASM and the City of Mill Valley. ","Detailed description: The Sewerage Agency of Southern Marin (SASM) is a Joint Powers Agency formed in 1979 to consolidate the wastewater collection treatment water reclamation and disposal needs of about 28000 residents in Southern Marin County. SASM is made up of six Member Agenices (MA's). They are: the City of Mill Valley Tamalpais Community Services District Almonte Sanitary District Alto Sanitary District Homestead Valley Sanitary District and Richardson Bay Sanitary District. Each Sanitary District has one seat on the SASM Board of Commissioners. Processed wastewater is further treated or reclaimed and used for landscape irrigation. The City of Mill Valley Parks Department uses reclaimed water throughout Bay Front Park. Use of reclaimed water for landscape irrigation saves precious fresh water supplies for domestic use - (source SASM Website). Implementing this project will increase drought resiliency. MMWD and SASM collaborated on a Recycled Water Feasibility report that looked at all the demand for recycled water in the SASM service area and the available supply of water for recycling. Several potential projects were identified with the most economically feasible project being recommended for implementation. The project would increase the production of recycled water from SASM from about 30AFY to 100 AFY. The water would be supplied to recycled water customers including the City of Mill Valley Tamalpais High School and various businesses (maily cooling and irrigation) located along Camino Alto between Sycamore Ave and the high school. The project includes replacement and expansion of the existing recycled water treatment facilities and approximately 1 mile of pipe. Project partners include Marin Municipal Water District Sewerage Agency of Southern Marin and City of Mill Valley.

Tidal marsh habitat is used by many birds provides nursery habitat for fish and portions of the marsh provides suitable habitat for the salt marsh harvest mouse. This project would increase the total amount of habitat and enhance more. The increased tidal prism is expected to help maintain the flood-flow capacity of the main channel of Corte Madera Creek reducing the need for dredging. The perimeters of the newly excavated marshes would be designed to accommodate rising sea-level. ","Detailed description: The project area includes four tidal marshes that were filled when the Corte Madera Creek Flood Control Project was built. These are: Creekside Marsh is a portion of Hal Brown Park at Creekside a Marin County Park. It was filled in during construction of the Corte Madera Creek Flood Control Project in the late 1960s; the park was developed in the early 1970s and it included the 21-acre tidal wetland. A single 60-inch culvert connects the southern part of the marsh to the main channel of Corte Madera Creek; that culvert will be replaced in fall 2013 or fall 2014 depending on permitting. About 4 acres of Creekside Marsh will be affected by that project. The remainder of the marsh will be enhanced as part of this project including replacing a 4-bore culvert near the upstream boundary between the marsh and Corte Madera Creek. Dog Park is the informal name given to a 5-acre College of Marin parcel. A tidal channel connected to the main channel of Corte Madera Creek through a 3-bore culvert at the northeastern corner of the parcel loops around the eastern and southern boundary of the parcel. About 4.2 acres are too high in elevation for any tidal action. Local dog walkers have turned this area into an off-lease dog area.Lot 13 is a unpaved parking lot at the College of Marin in a 7-acre parcel. It is surrounded by compromised tidal wetlands. Tamalpais Creek flowed through this area into Corte Madera Creek before the wetlands were filled and Tamalpais Creek was culverted and relocated north. We propose to partially daylight the creek and restore its downstream end to the wetland at Lot 13.Ecology Study Area is another College of Marin parcel about 2.5 acres in size. About half of the area is being restored to an oak woodland by Friends of Corte Madera Creek Watershed; the other half is proposed for restoration to tidal action. The single culvert connecting this tidal channel to Corte Madera Creek has been replaced by three parallel culverts two of which are capped. When the planning environmental review and permitting is in place the grading can be done and the two culverts uncapped. ","Project Need: We are proposing to re-establish a former tidal salt marsh and stream ecosystem complex. Benefits would be significant and include environmental and recreational/transportation components. The entire project area was tidal wetland until it was filled as part of the US Army Corps of Engineers Corte Madera Creek Flood Control Project in the late 1960s. Re-establishing tidal wetlands would sequester additional CO2. Recent research suggests that restoring tidal salt marshes is a very effective way to sequester CO2 more effective than planting trees or other habitat enhancement measures. Re-establishing the tidal wetland would buffer adjacent upland areas from rising sea level. These areas include homes a Ross Valley Sanitary District Pumping station and College of Marin facilities. Re-routing Tamalpais Creek and Murphy Creek into the restored wetland and would enhance the ecological value of the mixing zone which is now in the culvert. The two creeks flowed though tidal wetlands east of College Avenue before the U.S Army Corps of Engineers flood control project was constructed; they now enter culverts west of Kent Avenue and flow in twin culverts to the stilling basin of the flood control project. These long culverts are difficult to maintain and their capacity is reduced by accumulated sediment. The new wetland around Lot 13 would provide additional water retention capacity in an area with chronic flooding. McAllister Creek flows along the western side of Creekside Marsh. Enhancing that marsh would provide more filtration of the water as it flows to Corte Madera Creek. Water quality in Corte Madera Creek and San Francisco Bay would be improved. Runoff from Lot 13 the dirt path leading to the main channel near Lot 13 and a BMX track at the ESA would no longer carry sediment and pollutants directly into the creeks. Stabilization of eroding banks would also reduce sediment inputs. Design of the new system would provide bioretention and other measures to manage stormwater flow from adjacent developed areas into the newly configured wetlands. And finally the new tidal marsh itself would remove pollutants from the water moving through it. Fish and wildlife would benefit from the increased productivity of the enlarged tidal marshes better water quality improved geomorphic function of the creeks removal of invasive non-native plants particularly groves of acacias near the former mouth of Tamalpais Creek and throughout the part of the ESA used as a BMX track.

Pinole Creek channel was constructed by the Corps in the early 1960s after a series of floods inundated downtown Pinole. This design reduced flood risk but provided limited habitat due to lack of vegetative cover and also was not sustainable due to the over deepening of the channel invert that was required to achieve the desired flood risk reduction. The over deepened invert had subsequently reverted to an equilibrium condition due to lack of maintenance stemming from the loss of all revenue after the 1977 passage of Proposition 13. Specifically this project is an extension of the Phase I Demonstration Project that was funded under a State of California River Parkways Grant which was completed in 2010. The Phase I Demonstration Project successfully modified the Corps' channel design to preserve the equilibrium channel (and associated habitat) while providing the design level of flood protection. This restoration project would extend this concept upstream and downstream of the area covered in the Phase I Demonstration Project. ","Project Need: Pinole Creek is tidally influenced. It was channelized in the 1960s by the Corps of Engineers. The traditional corps design called for the removal of channel meanders and vegetation construction of a uniform trapezoidal bank structure and over deepening of the channel invert in the tidally influenced portions. This is how the channel operated for nearly 50 years. With the passage of Proposition 13 in 1977 tax levels in this watershed were frozen at the prior years' amount which had been set at zero that year because it had accumulated a small fund balance. This meant that the watershed had zero revenue but an ongoing operations and maintenance responsibility. As expected maintenance has been (and continues to be) minimal. The Corps' constructed over-deepened channel bottom was not dredged and filled in with sediment to reach an equilibrium condition. In 2004 The Flood Control District local cities regional experts watershed stakeholders and the public responded with the creation of the Pinole Creek Vision Plan which laid out a new vibrant vision for the creek. This included restoring the design level of flood protection preserving and increasing in-channel and stream-side habitat and keeping the equilibrium channel rather than dredging. The Pinole Creek Phase I Demonstration Project implemented this vision in a very visible portion of the creek and has been used to continue to build community support for expansion both upstream and downstream. This restoration project is that expansion. The Corps has periodically worked on the planning of an ecosystem restoration project under their Continuing Authorities Section 1135 Program. However federal funding of the program has been spotty making progress a challenge. One solid work product from that partnership has been the Existing Conditions Report recently drafted by the Corps' Consultant Atkins. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the restoration project is not implemented Pinole Creek will continue to languish with poor habitat. Pinole Creek currently supports a small population of Steelhead and Rainbow Trout. The limited development in the upper two thirds of the watershed (it's owned by East Bay Municipal Utilities District as watershed lands) and the relative ease of removing the few in-stream fish passage barriers makes Pinole Creek an excellent fisheries restoration opportunity.

Zone 1 includes parts of the cities of Martinez Concord Walnut Creek and Pleasant Hill near the Interstate 680 freeway. The majority of customers are located near Pacheco/Contra Costa Boulevard beginning at north Highway 4 and ending at Taylor Boulevard. ","Project Type Description: This is a water recycling project that will add landscape irrigation customers to the CCCSD existing Zone 1 recycled water distribution system. Zone 1 includes parts of the cities of Martinez Concord Walnut Creek and Pleasant Hill near the Interstate 680 freeway. CCCSD and Contra Costa Water District reached an agreement which permits CCCSD to provide customers within Zone 1 with recycled water for industrial and landscape irrigation applications. This project provides water quality improvements to the Suisun Bay because effluent diverted to irrigation reduces CCCSD discharge volume which reduces pollutant loading into Suisun Bay. This project reduces freshwater diversions from the Sacramento Delta thereby improving water quality. ","Detailed description: Zone 1 is a region CCCSD and Contra Costa Water District agreed to permit CCCSD to provide recycled water for industrial and landscape irrigation applications. CCCSD currently provides 31 customers within Zone 1 with approximately 600 AFY of recycled water. The Zone 1 Pleasant Hill Project will connect approximately 20 new customers to an existing pressurized recycled water system. The proposed new customers include apartment complexes businesses and an elementary school. CCCSD has already identified new customers and estimated their irrigation demand based on historical usage. The estimated new demand is 100 AFY. Materials required connect a new customer include pipe back flow prevention devices and recycled water meters. Construction involves installing a pipe from the street to an existing dedicated irrigation meter or new recycled water meter. The project would replace potable with recycled water for irrigation. Since irrigation demands are seasonal using recycled water reduces the region s freshwater demands during the same months where water shortages typically occur. This increases the region s overall supply reliability. ","Project Need: Irrigation demands are seasonal with peak demand in summer time. Water shortages typically occur during the summer months. Therefore irrigating with recycled water reduces regional water demand during times where water shortages are most likely to occur. This improves regional water supply reliability. Water recycling is a component of Contra Costa Water District s long-term sustainable water supply strategy. In times of water shortages CCWD may impose water rationing. This project reduces the water demand and mitigates water shortages during drought year. CCWD water supply is from Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Using recycled water for landscape irrigation reduces the demands on the Delta for non-potable uses. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: In times of water shortages water rationing maybe employed. The use of recycled water for landscape irrigation reduces the demand on the CCWD potable system lessening the need to ration. Customers using recycled water will not be affected by water rationing that during water storages. ","Project Benefits: The project reduces environmental impacts on two water bodies: Suisun Bay and the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta. Using recycled water for irrigation reduces wastewater discharge volume and pollutant mass loading to Suisun Bay (CCCSD's receiving water body). With this project recycled water from the CCCSD facility replaces about 100 AFY of potable water sourced from the Delta used for landscape irrigation. The projects provides irrigation water during droughts thus reducing the need for CCWD to ration water during water shortages. The Zone 1 area includes disadvantaged communities (see map attached as project image). Since this project would reduce local business and park irrigation costs it would indirectly benefit disadvantaged communities by providing more funds for different projects. Furthermore the project provides an educational opportunity for students on resource recovery. ","  "," ","Contra Costa Sanitary District ","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0"

"299 ","Regional Green Infrastructure Capacity Building Program ","The goal of the Regional Green Infrastructure Capacity Building Program is to coordinate and increase the implementation throughout the nine-county Bay Area of green streets rainwater harvesting bioinfiltration systems water conserving landscaping small and large scale low-impact development (LID) techniques and the new generation of stormwater pollution prevention/flood control projects that restore stream channel habitat riparian areas and provide flood risk reduction. What green infrastructure techniques share is a preference for using or enhancing natural water features to conserve the resource rather than routing the water quickly through an impermeable feature to an outfall or receiving water body. Expanding the region's Green Infrastructure capacity is a critical step towards building drought preparedness and climate change resiliency in the region's watersheds. As such it complements the development and implementation of the Sustainable Communities Strategy which Bay Area regional and local agencies are developing in response to S.B. 375. ","('North Bay'; 'East Bay'; 'South Bay'; 'West Bay') | SF; Marin; Sonoma; Napa; Solano; Contra Costa; Alameda; Santa Clara; San Mateo "," ","ongoing ","tbd "," ","Project Type Description: Green Infrastructure is a broad term used to describe a variety of \"green solutions\" to problems historically solved with \"harder infrastructure.\" Over the past decade public agencies have gravitated towards green infrastructure because of the many positive benefits it produces. However the ability to shift from \"hard\" to \"green\" methods is constrained by lack of tools resources and data specifically designed for the Bay Area. Local officials need local information to feel confident about the potential success of public investments. Below are some of the benefits EPA has recognized about Green Infrastructure that are pertinent for IRWMP:   Cleaner Water   Vegetation green space and water reuse reduce the volumes of stormwater runoff and in combined systems the volume of combined sewer overflows as well as reduce concentrations of pollutants in those discharges.   Enhanced Local Water Supplies   Most green infiltration approaches involve allowing stormwater to percolate through the soil where it recharges the groundwater and the base flow for streams thus ensuring adequate water supplies for humans and more stable aquatic ecosystems. In addition capturing and using stormwater conserves potable water supplies amd has the potential of replacing all outdoor uses of potable water for landscape irrigation.   Cleaner Air   Trees and vegetation improve air quality by filtering many airborne pollutants and can help reduce the amount of respiratory illness. Transportation and community planning and design efforts that facilitate shorter commute distances and the ability to walk to destinations will also reduce vehicle emissions.   Reduced Urban Temperatures   Summer city temperatures can average 10 F higher than nearby suburban temperatures. High temperatures are also linked to higher ground level ozone concentrations. Vegetation creates shade reduces the amount of heat absorbing materials and emits water vapor   all of which cool hot air. Limiting impervious surface and using light colored impervious surfaces (e.g. porous concrete) also mitigate urban temperatures.   Moderate the Impacts of Climate Change   Climate change impacts and effects vary regionally but green infrastructure techniques provide adaptation benefits for a wide array of circumstances conserving and reusing water promoting groundwater recharge reducing surface water discharges that could contribute to flooding. In addition there are mitigation benefits such as reduced energy demands and carbon sequestration by vegetation.   Source Water Protection   Green infrastructure practices provide pollutant removal benefits thereby providing some protection for both ground water and surface water sources of drinking water. In addition green infrastructure provides groundwater recharge benefits.   Community Benefits   Trees and plants improve urban aesthetics and community livability by providing recreational and wildlife areas. Studies show that property values are higher when trees and other vegetation are present.   Cost Savings   Green infrastructure may save capital costs associated with paving creating curbs and gutters building large collection and conveyance systems and digging big tunnels and centralized stormwater ponds; operations and maintenance expenses for treatment plants pumping stations pipes and other hard infrastructure; energy costs for pumping water around; cost of treatment during wet weather; and costs of repairing the damage caused by stormwater such as streambank restoration. ","Detailed description: ABAG/SFEP established the LID leadership group (LIDLG) to examine how to get Green Infrastructure more integrated into the programs of local agencies regional agencies and water districts (see http://www.sfestuary.org/projects/detail2.php?projectID=44 for list of members). With LIDLG as advisors ABAG /SFEP will develop tools and engage with local planning and public works directors to improve understanding about why and how to integrate low impact development into land use planning site design and infrastructure development. A specific goal is the rapid and timely deployment of LID practices in the Priority Development Areas (PDAs) where much of projected development will occur and for which substantial infrastructure funding will be available over the next four years. ABAG /SFEP will coordinate with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission county Congestion Management Agencies and local jurisdictions through the PDA Growth and Investment Strategies to help ensure that infrastructure investments site and building designs in PDAs incorporate appropriate LID techniques. The UC-Berkeley Center for Resource Efficient Communities (CREC) and the Engineering Research Center for Re-Inventing the Nation s Urban Water Infrastructure (know as ReNUWit) will create a toolkit to assist Bay Area local governments and water agencies in the implementation of integrated water resource projects and green infrastructure. This toolkit will identify sub-regions of the Bay Area with shared sets of water management opportunities and constraints provide expert guidance on how various green infrastructure technologies translate to the physical and policy context of these sub-regions and identify ways to overcome barriers to implementation of appropriate green infrastructure projects within each sub-region. The expert guidance on green infrastructure technologies will include discussion of engineering issues economic costs and benefits water quality and urban design considerations. This guidance will be expressly tailored to the needs of staff of Bay Area local government and water/wastewater districts in order to address directly the challenges they face in implementation of integrated water resource projects. The guidebook will draw upon the expertise of UC-Berkeley experts in engineering chemistry economics city planning and landscape architecture. The UC-Berkeley team will also conduct a workshop with staff from Bay Area local governments water agencies and consulting firms to present the draft findings of the workshop and solicit feedback.

Berkeley researchers and graduate students) ","Project Need: The San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board s Municipal Regional Stormwater Permit (MRP) issued to 76 municipalities and special districts requires permittees to take a variety of actions to protect the waters of San Francisco Bay from listed stormwater contaminants including PCBs pesticides mercury and copper. The regional green infrastructure project will aid municipalities to comply with their stormwater requirements because it will 1) provide funding (through IRWMP) to municipalities wishing to plan and implement green stormwater solutions 2) increase the Bay Area's capacity to build such projects by increasing the tools available for planning and funding such projects 3) disseminate the lessons learned and thus make it easier for new municipalities to meet permit requirements. Per initial findings of BCDC Adapting to Rising Tides Project local governments are cash-strapped to make storm sewer improvements. Funding local governments to implement stormwater projects as projects within the Green Infrastructure Capacity Building Program and by opening the way for LID projects to be funded by congestion management agencies can help to close the funding gap for storm sewer system improvements (specifically increasing the capacity to treat stormwater outside of the storm sewer system reduces flow through the sewers and reduces the need for extra hard systems). And green steets projects help local governments meet MRP permit conditions to protect stormwater quality. Project(s) have a potential impact on regional policy: The Bay Area has begun to build green infrastructure with small-scale pilot projects. There is a definite need to provide convincing evidence that green infrastructure can effectively address stormwater issues and incentives for local governments to address stormwater problems in a more comprehensive and ecologically beneficial manner. Regional and local policies need to encourage the design and implementation of projects that achieve as many desirable outcomes as possible - treatment and detention of stormwater reduced strain of stormwater on combined sewer systems urban greening and reduced loading of pollutants and trash into downstream waterbodies. Additionally there may be cost savings associated with green infrastructure. The City of Philadelphia has recently proposed a green infrastructure plan in their NPDES stormwater permit in lieu of more \"grey\" infrastructure as a way to deal with the City's stormwater issues. Philadelphia estimates that green infrastructure would cost less than the complete overhaul of the sewage/stormwater system that would be needed. Given that much of the Bay Area stormwater infrastructure is at the end of its lifetime demonstration of regional cost benefit opportunities would be particularly beneficial. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Bay Area Cities will potentially be out of compliance with MRP. Bay and creeks remain polluted with stormwater runoff. Opportunities are missed to prepare for the effects of sea level rise. Opportunities are missed to save energy and reduce waste. ","Project Benefits: i.

The project purpose is to restore tidal marsh floodplain storage and floodplain habitat functions. The Project will restore the once-common transition area between the bottom land tidal flood plain and the Pinole Creek riparian corridor. ","('East Bay';) | Contra Costa County ","38.0128676208 | -122.293968201 ","September 2012 ","September 2014 ","The Chelsea Wetlands Restoration Project (Project) is located at the lower reach of Pinole Creek within its tidal influence reach near San Pablo Bay (Figure 1). The project site is a vacant 11-acre parcel immediately adjacent to Pinole Creek that was historically part of a large tidal marsh complex that fringed San Pablo Bay (Figure 2). The site was diked off and a large portion of it filled sometime in the late 19th/early 20th century during the development of the Pinole/Hercules area. The property is currently bordered by the Chelsea by the Bay housing development to the southeast Santa Fe Avenue to the northeast the San Francisco Bay Trail to the northwest and Pinole Creek to the southwest ","Project Type Description: ","Detailed description: Restoration activities include excavating fill soils realigning the existing tidal channel installing larger culverts that connect the property to Pinole Creek using some of the excavated soils to construct a gentle-sloped berm around the perimeter constructing a storm overflow weir constructing new flood walls where existing adjacent topography is low and installing public access improvements along the existing San Francisco Bay Trail adjacent to the site. 1) Soil Excavation: The restoration of the project site will begin with the excavation of approximately 50000 cubic yards of fill material that was placed on the project site a century ago. The site will be graded to the appropriate elevations for establishing tidal marsh (about half a foot below local mean high water to allow for natural hydrology to recondition the substrate). 2) Channel Realignment:. The existing tidal channel will be realigned along a roughly 1000-ft section and the realigned channel will be deeper and wider to increase tidal exchange capacity and storm runoff conveyance. 3) Culvert Replacement: This new channel will connect to Pinole Creek though an improved culvert array that will provide enough cross sectional area to allow full tidal action on the property. This connection to Pinole Creek will consist two 5-foot culverts (Figure 8) replacing the existing single 3-foot culvert. Both the channel and culvert array have been sized to ensure that the channel remains relatively stable and will not fill in with sediment. 4) Perimeter Berm: The upland margins surrounding the tidal marsh will be graded to allow a gentle transition between these habitats. In addition a 2-acre area of existing marsh-upland transitional habitat on the property will be integrated into the design to enhance this important ecotone. The upland margins of the restoration area will be planted with native vegetation while the marsh plain and channel will be allowed to self-colonize. 5) Storm Overflow Weir: The Project will also provide an off-channel floodplain storage for Pinole Creek during flood events. During storm events when water levels rise drastically above normal water from Pinole Creek will spill into the Chelsea wetlands over a weir that will be constructed in the adjacent maintenance road. A 100-ft section of the maintenance road will be lowered approximately 1-ft from the existing elevations to create a weir over which water can enter the wetlands during extreme flood events thereby enhancing the flood storage function of the restored wetland to Pinole Creek. The road in this area will be paved and the slopes reinforced with rip-rap to reduce erosion potential. This design allows the overflow of flood waters into the Chelsea wetlands at an elevation lower than that of the current maintenance road. This design allows realization of flood retention benefits at an earlier flood stage while still maintaining the utility of the maintenance road. By utilizing the natural bay-front marshes as flood storage reflecting natural conditions the project is innovative in that it demonstrates the effectiveness of this strategy for flood control and wildlife benefits. 6) Flood Walls: Flood walls will be installed in two areas around the Project perimeter to ensure that the minimum elevation around the basin is 14 ft NAVD88. These flood walls will provide the adjacent housing developments with the same level of flood protection provided by the flood walls that will be installed on Pinole Creek in conjunction with the adjacent Pinole Creek Demonstration Project. 7) Public Access Improvements. Two new overlooks with interpretive signs will be constructed along the Bay Trail adjacent to the restored marsh and two additional interpretive signs will be installed at either end of the restored marsh. ","Project Need: The project purpose is to restore tidal marsh floodplain storage and floodplain habitat functions. The Project will restore the once-common transition area between the bottom land tidal flood plain and the Pinole Creek riparian corridor. Throughout the San Francisco Estuary historic efforts to control and straighten stream corridors have cut off many of these passageways from their flood plains including at the lower reaches near the bay. This region-wide loss has caused the populations of many wildlife species dependent on such habitat to plummet and flood conditions to worsen. The Project will restore the wetland aquatic and wetland upland transitional habitats for a wide range of wildlife species and it will provide the local community with over 12 acre-feet of overflow flood storage capacity for lower Pinole Creek. The Project will also provide public access and interpretive elements by providing turnouts benches and signage along an existing alignment of the San Francisco Bay Trail.

Stream maintenance projects will provide addition flood protection. ","Detailed description: City Watersheds of Sonoma Valley is a component of a parent project in the Sonoma Valley identified as the Sonoma Valley Integrated Water Management Program. The City Watersheds project is comprised of six elements located in the Nathanson Creek and Fryer Creek sub-watersheds of Sonoma Creek which cover approximately 80% of the City of Sonoma. The six proposed project elements are listed below and then described in detail. Multi-Objective Detention Basins Fryer Creek Improvements at MacArthur Street City Water Supply Well Replacement Stream Maintenance and Restoration Nathanson Creek Protection from Sewer Southeast Sonoma Stormwater System Retrofit Element 1: Multi-Objective Detention Basins This project element will create multiple offline storage and/or detention basins located on publicly owned parks schools and open space in the Nathanson and Fryer subwatersheds possibly Sonoma Valley High School and Montini Open Space Preserve. Landowner partners may include the City of Sonoma Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District Sonoma Valley Unified School District and Sonoma County Water Agency. The basins will provide floodwater detention and groundwater recharge and cumulatively store at least 20AF. These are anticipated to be off-line basins though underground facilities may be considered if necessary. The facilities will capture and detain/retain direct storm water surface runoff and storm drain diversion. This element and element 2 will provide 10 year flood hazard reduction along most of Fryer Creek and incremental flood reduction along Nathanson Creek. Basin design will maximize passive infiltration to the deep zone aquifer wherever practical offsetting in some measure the effects of a declining groundwater table and saline intrusion from San Pablo Bay. Basin design will also consider the following:   Basins will have a low profile to maintain current land uses and minimize or avoid adverse visual impacts.   Working with the public agency landowners the basins will be developed in a manner consistent with land management plans and include pursuit of opportunities to meet objectives of those plans. For example element design may include developing preserving or enhancing agricultural land uses wetland features or recreational uses.   Each site is highly visible and publicly accessible creating the possibility for effective education. Interpretative educational signs will be included to convey how the project benefits the community and the watershed.   Public access facilities such as walking/hiking trails and viewpoints will be included as appropriate.   Wherever appropriate careful revegetation with native plant species will enhance wildlife habitat and provide additional education for visitors. Element 2: Fryer Creek Improvements at MacArthur Street This element will replace the culvert carrying Fryer Creek under MacArthur Street to increase flow capacity and reduce sedimentation in a manner that supports the habitat value of the stream corridor. This element together with element 1 will provide 10 year flood protection to most of the Fryer Creek watershed. Habitat value will be enhanced by removing invasive species and installing native plantings. The replacement culvert may be installed at a lower elevation reducing the existing ponding condition just upstream of the culvert during the rainy season if it reduces flood hazards and sediment deposition and is acceptable to the community. This improvement is identified by the City as being the most cost-effective capital improvement project with flood reduction benefits for the area. Element 3: City Water Supply Well Replacement To improve the reliability of the local municipal water supply and proactively respond to the effects of nearby saline groundwater intrusion and areas of groundwater depression within the city watersheds this element will replace and relocate an aging City of Sonoma municipal well along with a nearby monitoring well. The new municipal well is to be used in place of one of the aging City wells but will be designed to also allow for studying aquifer storage and potential for recovery in the watershed (ASR). A smaller diameter monitoring well would also be installed near the well to monitor changes during ASR as well as properly identify the aquifer characteristics in the new well. The new location of the well is expected to be within publicly-owned open space or park areas. The well would include a small pumphouse and appurtenances. An all-weather access road and pipeline would be required to convey water to the City s distribution system. Element 4: Stream Maintenance and Restoration In accordance with Sonoma County Water Agency s Stream Maintenance Program this element will include invasive species removal and native planting along reaches of Fryer and Nathanson Creeks. The work will also include sediment removal along Fryer and Nathanson Creeks including development of a low flow channel to enhance fish passage and sediment transport in the streams. Element 5: Nathanson Creek Protection from Sewer Two existing sewer pipelines that cross Nathanson Creek are exposed and vulnerable to damage from storm flows increasing the risk of raw sewage spills into the creek. Nathanson Creek supports both steelhead trout and Chinook salmon. This element will modify the existing damaged concrete encasements to increase the integrity of the pipeline protect water quality and the fishery and reduce the impediment to fish passage. Element 6: Southeast Sonoma Stormwater System Retrofit The southeast portion of the City of Sonoma is anticipated to be developed in the coming years. Prior to additional urbanization of the area -- while feasible opportunities still exist -- this element will re-route water away from the existing culvert-based drain systems to drain systems that are unlined or designed to infiltrate flow. Such retrofits will recharge groundwater and enhance water quality. This element will modify at minimum the existing 5th Street East stormdrain. This culvert discharges year-round flow to Schell Creek at Peru Road south of the City of Sonoma. Historically the flows   some of which originate from groundwater springs north of East MacArthur Street - were not conveyed in a stormdrain and were allowed to infiltrate into the ground via open ditches. This project element will pursue opportunities to restore the infiltration of flows that are currently contained within the stormdrain. ","Project Need: Over the past 50 years the Sonoma Valley has experienced rapid population growth and land use changes. This project is designed to address multiple interlocking water-related problems arising from these changes. The problems include groundwater aquifer decline flooding and sedimentation resulting from changes to runoff patterns dependence on water imported from the Russian River and severe declines in riparian forest anadromous steelhead and salmon and other aquatic-dependent species and habitats. People in Sonoma Valley are highly concerned about water supply and water quality but generally they do not realize how their everyday actions affect water conditions. Groundwater levels have declined in some portions of the Sonoma Valley. Groundwater pumping depressions have developed in areas southeast of the City of Sonoma and southwest of El Verano. There has been a significant increase in irrigated agriculture predominantly vineyards which rely heavily on groundwater. Domestic agricultural and urban water use is projected to increase placing further demands on the current groundwater supply that will likely result in lower groundwater levels in the future. These declines in groundwater level may result in increased extraction costs well deepening or replacements costs groundwater quality degradation including salinity intrusion land subsidence decreases in streamflow and damage to multiple fish and wildlife species. Achieving sustainable groundwater use is important as well because Sonoma Valley relies on water imports from the Russian River which may decline in future. Flood hazards increasingly threaten the community economically and environmentally. Damage to private and public property is caused by inadequate flood conveyance systems. Culverts creeks and streams are choked by sediment buildup and invasive plant species. Many years after their construction sewer pipelines lie exposed and vulnerable to damage or rupture during storm events which could result in the release of raw sewage. These exposed pipelines also impede fish passage. Principal causes of flooding in the City of Sonoma are perched channel conditions encroachment of development onto floodplains and inadequately-sized storm drainage infrastructure such as bridges and culverts. The City of Sonoma is built on the alluvial fan deposited by Nathanson Creek Arroyo Seco and Fryer Creek. Through years of flooding and sediment deposition the banks of Nathanson Creek at the northern end of the city have formed natural levees. Floodplains adjacent to streams with natural levees gently slope away from the stream channel resulting in banks that are higher than in surrounding development. As a result when these channels overtop their banks floods can inundate a large area. According to Flood Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) mapping Nathanson Creek is able to contain the 100 year flood with minor overbank flooding in some locations. However due to its perched conditions above adjacent lands significant flooding can occur during larger storms. Flooding in this watershed is caused by creek flooding overland flow causing street and structure flooding and storm drain system related flooding. Overland flooding also contributes to flooding at the southern extent of Nathanson Creek in the vicinity of a high school and the City s commercial center. Flooding in the Fryer Creek watershed is primarily driven by flooding of Fryer Creek and undersized storm drainage infrastructure. Areas of localized flooding result from Fryer Creek not being able to contain the 25-year 24-hour event within its banks. More extensive flooding occurs during the 100-year 24-hour event. Element 2 is a recommended Capital Improvement Project in the City of Sonoma s Storm Drain Master Plan. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If City Watersheds of Sonoma Valley is not implemented watershed degradation and flood hazards will continue to occur. The cost to extract groundwater will increase as groundwater levels decline. Wells will need to be drilled deeper into the aquifer or replaced entirely and the reliability of the local municipal water supply will become less stable. Groundwater quality will also decline evidenced by salinity intrusion potential land subsidence (cones of depression) decreases in streamflow and further losses of salmonids riparian forests wetlands and other biodiversity assets. Chronic water shortages would be particularly devastating to this agricultural economy. Without this project flooding will continue to worsen within the city and downstream. ","Project Benefits: City Watersheds of Sonoma Valley will provide both flood hazard protection and groundwater benefits within the boundaries of the City of Sonoma. It will make strides towards meeting the water supply water quality and flood hazard reduction needs of the community while at the same time improving watershed function by enhancing the connection between surface and groundwater systems. i. Water Supply Groundwater represents a large percentage of urban and agricultural water supply in Sonoma Valley. Elements 1 and 6 both recharge groundwater with stormwater. Element 3 directly improves the reliability of the local municipal water supply and proactively responds to the effects of saline groundwater intrusion. ii. Water Quality Elements 1 3 and 6 protect groundwater quality by slowing salinity intrusion and protect surface water quality by slowing stormwater runoff and moderating flood flows. The protection of sewer stream crossings in Element 5 will prevent the fisheries wildlife and public health hazards of raw sewage spills into local waterways. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management The facilities provided in Element 1 will serve as combined flood detention and groundwater recharge facilities capturing and detaining/retaining direct storm water surface runoff and stormdrain diversion. In combination with the improvements in element 2 10 year flood hazard reduction along most of Fryer Creek and incremental flood reduction along Nathanson Creek will be provided. In Element 4 stream maintenance of select reaches of the Nathanson and Fryer watershed will provide additional flood protection. By slowing water deliveries to streams element 6 may reduce flooding downstream of the City of Sonoma. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) This package of interlocking project elements illustrates the power of partnerships to accomplish watershed-friendly water management. Potential sites for Element 1 include popular public recreational facilities including parks walking trails through protected open space (possibly Montini Open Space Preserve) and athletic fields (possibly at Sonoma Valley High School). These provide tangible opportunities for the community to learn first-hand about watershed management by seeing how these practices can be integrated into daily life. Element 1 includes construction of interpretive signs and viewpoints connected to popular trails within blocks of Sonoma s historic much-visited plaza. To the degree possible Element 1 design will incorporate and increase historic or degraded habitats such as wetlands historic agriculture and riparian forest. In Element 2 and Element 4 aquatic and riparian habitat protection and restoration are an important part of stream maintenance and enhancement practices. These include removing invasive plant species and sediment build up restoring natural habitat by planting native species and improving anadromous fish passage. Both sites are bordered by public walking trails and have neighborhood constituencies who will be involved in planning planting cleanup and maintenance. Elements 1 2 and 4 may involve substantial volunteer effort as all three elements have a track record of sustaining committed volunteers. Hands-on experience successfully teaches community members about ecology water supply and conservation and watershed functions. Elements that potentially reduce Sonoma Valley s dependence on Russian River water imports (Elements 1 3 6) contribute to stream health and fisheries recovery in that North Coast region watershed.

An upgraded industrial wastewater plant will also treat a portion of storm water during heavy storm events to a higher quality reducing and preventing certain pollutants from entering the bay thus helping protect local aquatic wildlife. ","Detailed description: The City and County of San Francisco owns and operates the Mel Leong Treatment Plant (MLTP) through the San Francisco International Airport (SFIA). The MLTP includes an Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) and a Sanitary Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWTP). The IWTP treats industrial wastewater as well as first flush storm water runoff from airport facilities and the SWTP treats the sanitary sewage from the airport facilities. This project will upgrade current facilities to treat 1.6 MGD of industrial waste water and first flush storm water to a higher quality by installing state-of-the-art Dissolved Air Flotation and Trickling Filter treatment technologies. This will positively increase the water quality effluent released to the bay. The effluent from both facilities (IWTP and SWTP) is routed to either the effluent pump station or the water reclamation pump station. The effluent from the water reclamation pump station is used within the Airport for irrigation purposes under a restricted use permit. This project will upgrade the current tertiary treatment plant to produce up to 1.0 MGD of disinfected tertiary recycled water for unrestricted non-potable uses including landscape irrigation and urban reuse. This will be accomplished through the combined use of membrane microfiltration and hypochlorite disinfection. ","Project Need: Over 40% of the Airport Utility infrastructure is over 30 years old and many pipes and pump stations are failing a replacement program is needed. The current Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) is very out dated and operational costs are increasing while operation efficiency is decreasing. This project will help offset the current water demand the Airport has on limited potable water resources while increasing effluent storm water quality increase operational efficiency and reduce the likelihood of violations. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: Without this project there will be possible consequences including but not limited to: Continuous breaks and possible collapse of Airfield pavement in additional to fines from Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) because of future violations resulting from breakdown in aging IWTP.

","Project Type Description: Upgrading the WTP is necessary in order to improve drinking water quality improve system reliability and meet regulatory requirements. The WTP Improvements Project will improve the potable water quality and allow the City of Pittsburg to meet necessary regulatory requirements. It will also reduce pollutant loading to the Delta improving water quality for Delta users statewide. The project will allow the City to comply with the Filter Backwash Recycling Rule increasing the quantity of water recycled within the treatment process improving process efficiency and reducing reliance on Delta supplies. The project will improve stormwater management by constructing a new 0.5 mgd backwash basin designed to eliminate stormwater overflows of the lagoon. Eliminating stormwater overflows of the lagoon will reduce pollutants entering underlying groundwater basins. The project will reduce pollution to the Bay-Delta improving Delta water quality and associated aquatic habitat. The project will reduce flood risks by eliminating stormwater overflows of the lagoon which could exacerbate flooding issues during wet weather. DACs within the City's service area will have improved water supply reliability & increased water quality protection as the WTP will comply with State/federal requirements. DAC will be involved with the public outreach efforts during project implementation. ","Detailed description: The City of Pittsburg owns and operates a 32 mgd WTP that was last expanded and upgraded in 1990 and is in need of improvements to mitigate current operating problems prepare to reliably treat the flow rates for which it was originally designed and meet current and future drinking water regulations. The WTP is located in and serves the City of Pittsburg much of which is defined as a disadvantaged community. The WTP discharges spent filter backwash through three pipelines to the lower lagoon for storage and settling. Settled water from the lower lagoon is recycled through the WTP. According to water quality records from 2008 to 2010 the peak daily turbidity of the recycled water often exceeds 2 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) which is the turbidity limit recommended by the Cryptosporidium Action Plan (CAP) issued by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) to reduce the potential for reintroduction of pathogens from recycled flows. CDPH raised this issue to the City of Pittsburg in a letter dated December 21 2010 and requested that the City seek solutions to mitigate the recycled water turbidity problem. Additionally in the past the lagoon at the WTP site has overflowed; the last overflow occurred in March 2010 in which approximately 12 acre-feet (AF) of water from the lagoon overflowed to surrounding grounds and ultimately to Willow Creek. The overflow water is high in aluminum manganese and iron. Implementing the project specifically Phase 2 described below would dedicate a portion of the lagoon for stormwater storage protecting the local environment and aquatic habitat by preventing overflows into the creek during storm events. In response to this issue the City prepared a Water Treatment Plant Improvements Study which was finalized in July 2011. The Study identified three phases of high priority improvements to the City's WTP. The proposed City of Pittsburg WTP Improvements Project (Project) includes the three phases of improvements described in the Study. Phase 1 includes the following improvement measures: influent blending and chlorine dioxide contact chlorine dioxide generation and chemical storage and chlorinator modification ammonia feed relocation and spent filter backwash treatment. Phase 2 involves sludge management improvements including sedimentation basin mechanical sludge removal sludge thickening sludge dewatering and converting part of lower lagoon to a sludge lagoon). Phase 3 includes the addition of a 0.5 MG backwash basin. Project planning was completed through preparation of the WTP Improvements Study from August 2010 to July 2011 by the City of Pittsburg. Releasing a Request for Proposal (RFP) and conducting a competitive process to choose a consultant to perform design will take 3 months and can be completed immediately upon receipt of funding. Design is anticipated to take approximately 12 months for each Phase. After design is complete there will be a bid process to select a construction contractor. This is expected to take about 3 months. Upon notice to proceed (NTP) the contractor will be begin construction. Environmental documentation will take about one month; it is anticipated that a Categorical Exemption will be required as there will be no increase in rated capacity at the Plant and improvements will be made on the existing site. The City of Pittsburg's Planning Department can file a Notice of Exemption with the County Clerk at any point deemed necessary. The schedule assumes the Notice of Exemption will be filed approximately one month prior to receipt of funding so that the WTP Improvements Project will be CEQA compliant upon receipt of funding. At that time design will begin immediately followed by construction. ","Project Need: The need for the WTP Improvements Project is demonstrated in the following ways: - As previously stated the City's WTP has not been upgraded since 1990 and as the City continues to grow and while per capita water consumption has been reduced overall water use will increase the system needs to be improved and expanded in order to operate efficiently adequately treat increased flow rates and meet State and federal water quality regulations. - The City is currently not complying with the Filter Backwash Recycling Rule (FBRR) as the recycled water feed location is downstream of the rapid mix process where coagulant is added. - The WTP is not complying with the CDPH CAP and has been directed to seek solutions to mitigate the recycled water turbidity problem by the CDPH. - Currently Sedimentation Basins 1 and 2 and Basin 3 4 and 5 operate separately as two parallel treatment trains. Combining these treatment trains is needed to increase operational efficiency and overall long-term water supply reliability. - The WTP improvements are needed to address a critical water quality need of the DAC served by the WTP. - In the past the lagoon at the WTP site has overflowed to surrounding grounds and ultimately to Willow Creek. The overflow water is high in aluminum manganese and iron. Implementing Phase 2 would dedicate a portion of the lagoon for stormwater storage protecting the local environment and aquatic habitat by preventing overflows into the creek during storm events. Goals and objectives of the WTP Improvements Project include: 1. Comply with CAP and FBRR requirements. 2. Improve operational efficiency. 3. Address a critical water quality need of a DAC. 4. Protect the environment and habitat by preventing overflows from the lower lagoon to the creek. 5. Increase water supply reliability. 6. Provide stormwater and emergency overflow storage. 7. Reduce reliance on Delta supplies. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If the City of Pittsburg were not to upgrade the WTP it would not be able to increase use of the existing groundwater system thus relying on increased Delta supply to meet customer demands. In this way the Project is needed to avoid additional Delta water demands. The City would continue not to comply with State and federal regulations if the project is not implemented and the lagoon could overflow into surrounding areas including Willow Creek further impacting local habitat. ","Project Benefits: Implementing the WTP Improvements Project will provide benefits primarily to the City of Pittsburg water service area including the DACs within its boundary. benefits include: 1-Water users will have improved water supply reliability and increased water quality protection as the WTP will comply with State and federal requirements. 2-By replacing the potassium permanganate with chlorine dioxide there will be a reduction in taste-and-odor issues and the potential for disinfection-byproduct formation. 3-This will also allow for more efficient use of groundwater from the Pittsburg Basin. 4-The project will also benefit the surrounding environment as well as the greater downstream Bay-Delta ecosystem by providing habitat and environmental protection through prevention of lagoon overflow. 5-The project will improve supply reliability throughout the Region and the State by avoiding the need for additional Delta supplies to meet future demands that would otherwise be met through groundwater supply from the City's WTP.

","Project Type Description: Contra Costa County is a densely developed area with a high percentage of imperviousness and significant industrial uses. Pollutants from atmospheric deposition building and landscape maintenance vehicle leaks and other sources are conveyed by stormwater runoff into local creeks the Carquinez Strait San Pablo Bay and San Francisco Bay. Studies have identified urban runoff as a primary contributor to water quality impairments in these creeks and water bodies. Extensive impervious surfaces aid in rapid the transport of stormwater resulting in modifications to creeks that impairs their functions and habitat value. The Program will address these water quality problems by facilitating property owners in retrofitting their properties with a suite of LID features that will reduce the quantity and improve the quality of stormwater runoff. The education and public outreach aspects of the project will spread the benefits beyond LID installation sites. Creeks within the project area include Baxter Creek Cerrito Creek Garrity Creek Pinole Creek Rheem Creek Rodeo Creek San Pablo Creek and Wildcat Creek. The San Francisco Basin Plan designates beneficial uses for these creeks including Wildlife Habitat both Cold and Warm Freshwater Habitat and Fish Spawning and Migration. The creeks in the project area are all 303(d) listed for impairments in Trash and/or Diazinon with the exceptions of Garrity Creek and Rheem Creek. The project area s creeks are tributary to the Carquinez Strait San Pablo Bay and San Francisco Bay which support beneficial uses including Estuarine and Wildlife Habitat; Preservation of Rare and Endangered Species; Fish Migration and Spawning; Contact and Noncontact Water Recreation; Shellfish Harvesting; and Ocean Commercial and Sport Fishing. Among the 303(d) listings for the water bodies are impairments for Mercury Dioxin Compounds Furan Compounds PCBs and Trash. The Wildcat Creek Wetland and San Pablo Creek Wetland which are not listed for impairments share many of the beneficial uses designated for the San Pablo and San Francisco Bays and the Carquinez Strait. Nonpoint sources that interfere with beneficial uses in the project area include atmospheric deposition vehicle-related pollutants littering building and landscape maintenance and high imperviousness. These nonpoint sources are largely associated with the land uses from which the project will manage runoff. LID facilities to be installed under the program include rain gardens pervious hardscaping self-retaining areas and rain barrels. The treatment volume goal for facilities will be to retain the first  -inch of runoff from tributary areas; that runoff will be managed by evapotranspiration infiltration and use for landscape irrigation. To the extent that it is appropriate for installation sites designs will exclude underdrains (or elevate outlets so that the above-noted volume is managed prior to the discharge of any runoff). ","Detailed description: The Program will provide private property landowners a rebate program to cover up 80% of the construction costs to install Low Impact Development (LID) features. The Program will include an education and outreach program available to all Western Contra Costa County residents regarding stormwater impacts of development and ways to reduce them. The Watershed Project (TWP) will develop and/or adapt materials to give to the public speak at local forums and local events. TWP and the County will provide free landscape assessments for property owners in unincorporated County to determine appropriate LID strategies that can be implemented on the property in order to reduce stormwater runoff and contamination. The County will prepare standard landscape plans for a variety of LID features including rain barrels rain gardens infiltration basins and pervious pavement. For those property owners interested in building LID features the County will prepare landscape plans and specification based on the results of the assessment. The property owner can choose to build all or a portion of the LID features; and will pay for all costs of the installation. The property owner can build the LID features themselves or hire a landscape contractor to build the LID features. The County will inspect projects whose owners wish to obtain a rebate. Simple projects will be inspected at the end of construction while more complex projects will be inspected during construction to ensure LID features are being constructed properly. Those homeowners who build the features as per plan pass an inspection of the features and sign a 10 year maintenance agreement with the County can apply and receive up to 80% of the total project materials and construction costs. It is anticipated that the Program will be able to provide rebates for installations on 3-5 commercial properties and between 40-80 residential properties. It is anticipated that should the TWP be awarded a grant contract the Contra Costa County LID Rebate Program will initiate in early 2013. Upon notification of the grant award the TWP will pursue contracting with the County and a landscape architect/engineering firm to provide program support. Early in 2013 the County will develop Education and Outreach materials for water quality impacts of development and ways to address them the rebate program including free landscaping assessments preparation of plans for LID features and the rebate program.

The coordinators will compile and analyze existing water quality data identify dumping sites and other NPSP and prioritize work areas. The coordinators will work with the City of San Pablo and Richmond to assist with fulfillment of Municipal Regional Permit requirements (MRP) and will recruit and train volunteers to help conduct at least three trash assessments in collaboration with Contra Costa County Watershed Program and municipal authorities. Based on preliminary findings the coordinators will determine if there is a need to perform additional samplings. Moreover the coordinators will engage the community in other stewardship activities such as creek clean ups and creek mapping. The coordinators will recruit volunteers through community meetings and newsletters; both of these will also serve to educate the public about issues associated with water quality and creek ecology and the most effective ways they can reduce their impact on the creeks. The coordinators will also work with the Cities of San Pablo and Richmond and West Contra Costa County School District to develop service-learning opportunities for students aimed at reducing NPSP. Stormwater Improvements/Infiltration: The watershed coordinators will initiate the development of multiple strategically located stormwater management projects using low impact development strategies throughout the San Pablo Bay South watershed. These projects will reduce surface runoff and flooding and will enhance infiltration. The coordinators will work with community groups and local municipal agencies to determine key project sites that will produce the largest impact on stormwater management and will enable effective and long-term community engagement. My building LID projects on the community level this plan will also increase watershed awareness and the overall ability of communities to understand the impacts of and properly respond to storm events. Additionally projects like rain gardens and bioswales will increase infiltration of surface water. Habitat Protection and Restoration: To address the improvement of habitat in the San Pablo Wildcat Rheem and Garrity Creek watersheds the coordinators will collaborate with project partners and watershed stakeholders to identify and prioritize invasive plant removal and re-vegetation project sites. Volunteers will be recruited trained and coordinated by the watershed coordinators to participate in invasive plant removal and native re-vegetation community work days. Coordinators will work with the Contra Costa County Recycle More program the Bay-Friendly Gardening program and cities of San Pablo and Richmond to coordinate native plant wildlife/green gardening or waste reduction workshops for homeowners and residents within select invasive plant removal and re-vegetation project sites areas. All invasive plant removal and re-vegetation projects will be initiated as grassroots efforts managed primarily by the local community in order to ensure long-term maintenance and care. Relation to Disadvantaged Communities: The majority of people directly served by the community-based activities in the work plan live in the Cities of Richmond and San Pablo or the unincorporated community of North Richmond all of which are marked as Disadvantaged Communities on the IRWMP maps. The projects in the work plan focus on community-based activities. These include a variety of stewardship opportunities such as invasive plant removal planting and maintenance of native plants trash assessments and cleanups water quality monitoring and active construction of restoration and Low Impact Development projects. In addition to engaging the community in stewardship community outreach is also used to include people in project planning and design. Service learning activities merge education with direct action to improve watershed conditions. We also will make numerous in-class presentations to students. By engaging community members in hands-on education and awareness activities we will build the resiliency of these communities to changes in climate major storm and flood events and will enhance the overall watershed health.

Related to a Disadvantaged Community: Pescadero is a disadvantaged community. ","Detailed description: Sediment from the upper watershed has filled portions of lower Butano Creek. Over the last decade increasing amounts of the flow in lower Butano Creek have left the prior primary channel and flowed overland or through smaller channels into Butano Marsh. There is concern by regulatory agencies and the public about potential impacts on sensitive species including threatened steelhead trout from this configuration. Butano Marsh contains remnant agricultural channels levees and culverts that may present constraints to fish passage and may limit the development of instream and wetland habitat. This project will examine existing conditions on Butano Creek and Butano Marsh and develop alternatives to protect sensitive species and enhance wetland habitat. One key objective will be to determine the feasibility of improving water movement into the lower elevation floodplain. The project will analyze options for restoring a channel for Butano Creek that could provide both enhanced passage for salmonids and improved in-stream habitat. Stream course restoration options will also address potential benefits to adjacent marsh and flood plain. The objective will be to identify restoration options with benefits to both salmonids and other sensitive species and habitats. The restored Butano Creek and Butano Mash would be available for appropriate recreational access; additional project activities could address improving that access.

"310 ","Tomales Bay Watershed Water Quality Monitoring and Improvement Program ","Working with our partners at the Tomales Village Community Services District (TVCSD) and other resource managers in the watershed the Tomales Bay Watershed Council will identify long-term water quality trends reduce and eliminate existing threats and identify emerging threats to water quality throughout the watershed. This monitoring program has identified potential source areas of pathogens in the Walker Creek watershed and elsewhere and TVCSD will implement source control measures that will protect water quality in their service area. ","('North Bay';) | Marin County ","38.089 |  -122.786 ","ongoing ","3 years after initiation ","This program will include the entire Tomales Bay watershed a 225 square mile area bounded by the slopes of Mount Tamalpais to the south the Inverness Ridge to the west agricultural lands to the east and the town of Tomales to the north. ","Project Type Description: This program will monitor long-term water quality trends in Tomales Bay and tributary creeks. The Bay and its major tributaries are listed as impaired for pathogens nutrients and sediment and Walker Creek and Tomales Bay for mercury as well. Building on five years of data from our existing program continued monitoring will document changes in water quality associated with watershed management activities global climate change ocean acidification and sea level rise. This program will also address potential pathogen sources in the town of Tomales by improving existing infrastructure and protecting coastal water quality by keeping stormwater separate from wastewater and from reaching tributary creeks and Tomales Bay. Water quality data is important in habitat restoration planning and assessment for aquatic and marine ecosystems throughout the region. ","Detailed description: The Tomales Bay Watershed Water Quality Monitoring Program will continue to monitor fixed sites at 11 tributary streams and 4 bay sites year-round for pathogens nutrient and sediment parameters. In addition field measurements (e.g. temperature DO pH flow etc.) will be collected. This information builds on past and current monitoring data to characterize trends in water quality particularly for listed impairments for Tomales Bay and tributaries. Resource managers regulators and the public benefit from this ability to measure the effectiveness of management actions and focus implementation efforts to where they are most needed. The Tomales Bay Watershed Council (TBWC) will continue to provide a forum for information sharing and interfacing with the public about water quality including regular electronic notices of water quality conditions during the recreation season newsletters and a final state of the bay conference to consider any conclusions and priorities for action. Working together TBWC will partner with the Tomales Village Community Services District (TVCSD) to implement phase I of their system improvement program. TVCSD will remove and replace ACP manholes and line the lower town lift station to prevent inflow and infiltration for the protection of coastal water quality and prevention of unwanted overflows. Stormwater may currently affect the system via infiltration which may then impact Keys Creek which flows to Walker Creek and Tomales Bay. Phase I will provide important and lasting protection to these waters. ","Project Need: The Tomales Bay Watershed Water Quality Monitoring Program is the only watershed-scale program designed to sample year-round for the sources of impairment for Tomales Bay and tributary streams. This program is used by local resource managers and agencies alike to prioritize efforts direct funding and evaluate the effectiveness of management practices utilized in the area. In addition Lagunitas Creek watershed provides 75% of the drinking water supply to Marin Municipal Water District for use in east Marin and ongoing aquatic habitat restoration projects throughout the watershed depend upon high water quality for their ultimate success. Continuing the existing monitoring program will enable continued data collection determination of long-term (10 year) water quality trends and will provide accountability and direction to policy makers and regulators. As global climate change ocean acidification and sea level continue this monitoring will provide an invaluable baseline for future understanding of effects and change. The Tomales Village Community Services District (TVCSD) will undertake phase I of their improvement program designed to protect coastal water quality from potential stormwater contamination. This phase is a distinct and necessary first step in modernizing the existing treatment operation which lies adjacent to Keys and Walker Creeks. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: If this program is not funded the only comprehensive monitoring program in place for Tomales Bay will be halted and the ability to determine long-term trends lost. If phase I is not implemented by TVCSD there is a potential for catastrophic system failure causing major stormwater contamination to coastal tributaries and Tomales Bay. The mouth of Walker Creek is a conditionally approved oyster growing area for local companies who produce oysters for the San Francisco and North Bay marketplace. This would be the first area affected by such a catastrophe. Tomales Bay is used year-round for water recreation and human health may also be at risk if such an event occurs. Impacts to the marine and aquatic ecosystems are difficult to predict but these sensitive and rich communities would also be impacted if contamination were to occur. As global climate change ocean acidification and sea level rise occurs monitoring will be the basis for effective management decisions and without such a program we may lose a very important opportunity to respond to changes in Tomales Bay. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) N/A ii. Water Quality This project provides the benchmark for the impacts of current and future watershed management actions to improve water quality. Also this project removes potential sources of contamination from accessing surface creeks and coastal waters. The Tomales Bay Watershed Water Quality Monitoring Program is the most cost effective way to continue water quality data collection and analysis distribution of results ongoing communication with collaborators and the public. This ongoing program has been refined over the last 5 years and is the most economically effective way to continue to gather water quality data for the Tomales Bay watershed area. The Tomales Village Community Services District has completed a feasibility study to evaluate and document priorities and costs for continued effective treatment and handling within their service area. By phasing their efforts they will successfully proceed with the highest priority activities as they seek funding for the remaining work to be undertaken. Phase I of the TVCSD plans has a direct and potentially important impact on water quality protection. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management This project will include phase I implementation of the Tomales Community Village Services District's plan to replace existing elements of their system to further protect groundwater creek and coastal water quality from contamination during storm events. By replacing existing manholes and lining the lift station in the town of Tomales changes will be made to keep wastewater from contacting stormwater and thereby flowing into the adjacent waterbodies. iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The Tomales Bay Watershed Council will continue to bring together all of the partners that participated in the Tomales Bay Integrated Coastal Watershed Management Plan. Watershed priorities remain accurate today even as some of the priority projects have shifted over time. Tomales Bay aquatic and terrestrial habitats within its watershed and the adjacent coastal areas are recognized internationally for their unique and important qualities. These rich and valuable habitats are protected as Areas of Special Biological Significance national marine sanctuaries and are enjoyed by millions of visitors annually due to the public lands and open spaces that have been protected for use by the public. By providing ongoing water quality information we will improve our understanding of our impacts on the landscape effects of ocean acidification global climate change and thereby promote continued and improve stewardship of these resources. Similarly as the Tomales Village Community Services District strives to meet current and future needs and challenges their continued commitment to sound stewardship and responsible management will protect the quality of local groundwater creeks and the coastal waters the flow to Tomales Bay.

"313 ","Anderson Dam Seismic Retrofit Project ","This project will make improvements necessary to Anderson Dam and its appurtenances so they will withstand a maximum credible earthquake and probable maximum flood event. These improvements will enable the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) to operate the reservoir at full capacity. Operating the reservoir at full capacity will increase the reservoir's yield by 10500 acre-feet per year on average and increase downstream flows in Coyote Creek for anadromous fish. Restoring full operating capacity will also increase recreational opportunities on the reservoir including boating.

","Project Type Description: Drinking Water Supply: Anderson Reservoir is used for drinking water treatment plant supply and groundwater recharge (groundwater accounts for up to 50 percent of countywide water use). This project will increase the reservoir's water supply yield by an average of 10500 acre-feet per year. Water Quality Improvement: SCVWD can use Anderson Reservoir to store its Central Valley Project (CVP) supplies. When we anticipate poor summer/fall water quality conditions in San Luis Reservoir (the source of our CVP supplies) we take our CVP supplies in the spring and use them in the summer/fall to meeting drinking water treatment plant demands and avoid algae-laden water that is difficult to treat. Restoring full operating capacity will increase the storage available to manage drinking water quality. Groundwater and Infiltration: As noted above Anderson Reservoir is used for groundwater recharge. This project will increase the availability of water for groundwater recharge. Habitat Protection and Restoration: SCVWD makes releases from Anderson Reservoir to provide habitat for anadromous fish downstream in Coyote Creek. The increase in operating capacity will increase the cold-water pool available for summer releases. ","Detailed description: Anderson Reservoir is SCVWD s largest reservoir providing more storage than all its other reservoirs combined. The reservoir was designed for water supply purposes though the reservoir also provides flood protection benefits through reservoir operating rules that reduce the likelihood of flooding recreation activities such as boating and fishing and environmental benefits through operations that provide suitable water flows and temperatures to benefit habitats. However SCVWD is currently operating Anderson Reservoir at restricted capacity (61810 acre-feet of 90373 acre-feet; 68%) due to seismic stability concerns. The Anderson Dam Seismic Retrofit Project makes improvements to Anderson Dam and its appurtenances so that the reservoir can be operated at full capacity. The project includes upstream and downstream embankment excavation and buttresses to improve seismic stability a new low-level outlet carrier pipe in an oversized tunnel to accommodate fault rupture a high-level outlet tunnel that will discharge in the spillway to provide the ability to draw down the reservoir quickly and raised spillway walls and dam crest to safely pass the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF). Attachment 1 is project's Planning Study Report. Restoring operating capacity to the reservoir will result in multiple benefits. Specifically the project will: Enable SCVWD to put an average of 10500 acre-feet per year of additional local runoff to beneficial use for groundwater recharge and drinking water treatment plant supplyIncrease the cold-water pool and increase summer releases to Coyote Creek by an average of 5 cubic feet per second (cfs)Increase the potential to operate the Anderson Hydroelectric FacilityIncrease storage capacity by approximately 28500 acre-feet (helps adapt to droughts and extreme weather due to climate change) andReduce the need to treat algae-laden supplies from San Luis Reservoir by taking supplies earlier in the year and storing them in Anderson Reservoir for use in the summer and fall (algae can result in aesthetic concerns and/or reduced treatment plant capacity due to filter clogging). The Anderson Dam Seismic Retrofit is part of SCVWD s Safe Clean Water and Natural Flood Protection Program which voters approved in 2012 with more than 70 percent of the votes. The project is also supported by local jurisdictions especially the City of Morgan Hill as demonstrated through outreach on SCVWD s Capital Improvement Program. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found  the methodology process and criteria for evaluating the   the staff recommended alternative (Alternative No. 15) to be appropriate and well presented.  Santa Clara County Parks and Recreation Department partners with SCVWD to provide recreational opportunities on and around the reservoir. There are multiple CalEnviroScreen disadvantaged communities in Santa Clara County including several along Coyote Creek in San Jose. The benefits of the proposed project will benefit all of Santa Clara County including the disadvantaged communities. The project will benefit groundwater in the Santa Clara Valley and Llagas Groundwater Subbasins. SCVWD is the designated CASGEM monitoring entity for both subbasins and both basins are covered in the Board-adopted 2012 Groundwater Management Plan. ","Project Need: Climate change : The project will increase operating storage capacity in Anderson Reservoir by approximately 28500 acre-feet. Storage will help capture flows from extreme weather events (adapting to floods) and carryover flows into dry years (adapting to droughts). In additional additional storage in Anderson will increase SCVWD s Anderson Hydroelectric Facility generating renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Lastly the increased capacity will result in a larger cold-water pool which will help with maintain habitat downstream on Coyote Creek. Reinforce/Enhance Water Supply Capacity: The project will provide approximately 28500 acre-feet of additional operating storage within the region. Regional Water Reliability/Long-Term Sustainability : The project will increase ability to use local runoff by an average of about 10500 acre-feet per year by increasing the operating storage of Anderson Reservoir by about 28500 acre-feet. This local supply is used for groundwater recharge and drinking water treatment plant supply (in-lieu recharge). The additional recharge will help maintain groundwater storage for use during droughts and other water shortages. The additional storage also helps SCVWD optimize its imported CVP allocations by enabling the District to transfer water from San Luis Reservoir into Anderson Reservoir to avoid water quality problems and if water levels are projected to drop too low in San Luis Reservoir water supply outages. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: SCVWD would not be able to regain about 28500 acre-feet of storage in Anderson Reservoir and an average of about 10500 acre-feet per year of water supply. This will reduce the ability of SCVWD to adapt to climate change and will reduce water supply reliability in Santa Clara County. Further this would reduce the amount of cold-water pool available to support downstream fisheries now and in the future. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) Anderson Reservoir is used for drinking water treatment plant supply and groundwater recharge that benefits all of Santa Clara County (groundwater accounts for up to 50 percent of countywide water use). This project will increase the reservoir's water supply yield by an average of 10500 acre-feet per year. The only alternative local supply that could deliver this average yield is potable reuse. The cost for an equivalent amount of potable reuse is about $210 million in capital costs plus $2 million in annual costs (present value of $245 million). This results in a benefit/cost ratio of about 1.4. Attachment 2 (150312 Board Package) has more information on potable reuse costs and opportunities. Attachment 3 documents the estimate water supply impact from the operating restrictions. ii. Water Quality SCVWD can use Anderson Reservoir to store its Central Valley Project (CVP) supplies. When we anticipate poor summer/fall water quality conditions in San Luis Reservoir (the source of our CVP supplies) due to low water levels (aka low point) we take our CVP supplies in the spring and use them in the summer/fall to meeting drinking water treatment plant demands and avoid algae-laden water that is difficult to treat. Restoring full operating capacity will increase the storage available to manage drinking water quality. One alternative to using Anderson Reservoir to store water in the spring for later summer use would be to increase chemical use at SCVWD s drinking water treatment plants. The estimated additional treatment costs are about $600000 per low point event based on experience from 2009. iii. Flood and Stormwater Management ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) SCVWD makes releases from Anderson Reservoir to provide habitat for anadromous fish downstream in Coyote Creek. The increase in operating capacity will increase the cold-water pool available for summer releases. Based on output from SCVWD s water planning and evaluation model summer flows immediately downstream of Anderson Reservoir will increase by an average of about 310 acre-feet per month (1850 AFY) or 5 cubic feet per second. The present value of this increase is flow using $80/AF (based on North Bay Watershed Association s Handbook for Estimating Economic Benefits of Environmental Projects) is about $3.7 million. Including this benefit value increases the benefit/cost ratio to 1.5.

","Project Type Description: Water Reuse/Recycling: Project will investigate reuse of water for irrigation; Stormwater Improvements: on-site management of stormwater run-off with green infrastructure improvements; Groundwater Benefits: treated stormwater which ultimately recharges groundwater; Infiltration: ideal conditions for infiltration as the urban area is built on sandy soil; Habitat Protection and Restoration: landscaping will include CA native plants which provides habitat for local species; Flood Protection: green infrastructure elements expected to reduce surface flows and provide additional protection against flooding; Related to a Disadvantaged Community: projects will be placed in or near a disadvantaged community ","Detailed description: These pilot projects will provide a basis for performance required maintenance and standardized details for the City of San Francisco's green infrastructure program. These projects reflect the range of conditions suited for green infrastructure across the eastside of the city. There will be four pilot projects implemented across the Eastside Basin: Chinatown Green AlleyWatershed: NorthshoreStormwater Features: Flow-through PlantersRedesign an alley similar to Trenton Street to maximize stormwater capture and detention. Replacing the asphalt middle lane with terraced lined flow-through planters has been proposed. In addition the garage on this street could close one entrance to create more open space. Permeable WiggleWatershed: Channel Stormwater Features: Bioretention and Permeable Paving Incorporation of bioretention and permeable paving in the parking lanes and alleys near \"the wiggle\" bike path potentially including Pierce Street between Haight and Duboce Waller between Pierce and Fillmore; Steiner betwen Haight and Duboce; Hermann between Steiner and Fillmore; and Germania Street between Steiner and Fillmore. McLaren Rainwater ProjectWatershed: SunnydaleStormwater Features: Cisterns and BioretentionThis project includes cisterns beneath Herz Playground for ball field and golf course irrigation. The cisterns will also serve in a bioretention capacity to promote groundwater recharge. These facilities would be located at the lower elevation of McLaren Park near Sunnydale Avenue. Upper Yosemite Creek Daylighting Watershed: Yosemite Stormwater Feature: Creek Daylighting The upper reach of Yosemite Creek Daylighting project would daylight the creek along a portion of the historic creek path from Yosemite Marsh in McLaren Park to the abandoned nursery at Woolsey and Hamilton Streets. This project diverts flows from the sewer using swales vegetated channels piped sections and a constructed wetland/detention basin/bioswale system. ","Project Need: Today impervious surfaces such as buildings streets and parking lots have covered most of San Francisco preventing rainfall infiltration. Over time creeks were buried and connected to the sewers and wetlands were filled. Instead of percolating into soils runoff now travels over impervious surfaces mobilizes pollutants and washes them into the sewer system or receiving water bodies. During heavy rain events stormwater runoff can contribute to localized flooding combined sewer discharges and the degradation of surface water quality. Moreover the decrease in infiltration resulting from paved surfaces contributes to groundwater depletion. While water quality protection is the fundamental driver behind stormwater management well-designed stormwater controls (i.e. Green Infrastructure) offer many direct and ancillary benefits. Some of the direct benefits include reducing and delaying the volumes and peak flows of stormwater reaching the sewer system. Volume reductions and and peak flow desynchronization can help reduce the number of storm water overflows reduces flooding and protects water quality. These types of projects can also improve the capacity and efficiency of San Francisco's treatment facilities. Some of the ancillary benefits include contributing to attractive civic spaces open spaces and streetscapes. Green Infrastructure also protects and enhances wildlife habitat and the potential to effectively integrate stormwater management into the redevelopment of historic sites. ","Discuss critical impacts that will occur if the proposal is not implemented: These early implementation projects are critical to gain public support for the SSIP Green Infrastructure Program inform the cost/benefit as utility assets and meet the goals of the City and County of San Francisco to revitalize public streets create green jobs and improve wildlife habitat. ","Project Benefits: i. Water Supply (conservation recycled water groundwater recharge surface storage etc.) Green Infrastructure includes designs (e.g. bioretention cisterns etc.) that are expected to offset the use of potable water for irrigation for existing and proposed landscapes thereby reducing overall potable water demand. Other types of designs (e.g. detention basins) act as surface storage areas during storm events and can act as open spaces during dry weather. ii. Water Quality Green infrastrcture treats stormwater and improves runoff to MS4 areas prior to discharge to the Ocean or Bay. Additionally stormwater discharges to the combined sewer system potentially benefit from the managment of TSS and heavy metals via green infrastructure reducing required treatment at the wastewater plants. ... iii. Flood and Stormwater Management Utilization of green infrastructure across the City will likely result in a reduction of flood waters and combined sewer discharges benefiting the City and Bay Area residents visitors and wildlife. ... iv. Resource Stewardship (watershed management habitat protection and restoration recreation open space etc.) The Urban Watershed Assessment (UWA) program is the planning process for the SSIP and will provide recommendations for the Earily Implementation Projects noted in this grant as well as additional future projects to be implemented over the next 20 years. A major consideration of UWA recommendations are project synergies among City departments and the public to manage natural resources improve recreational opportunities and more using watersheds as the planning units.

Using local recycled water reduces the need for imported water increases flows to the Delta which improves water quality. EBMUD has a groundwater recharge project using Mokelumne water. This project could preserve Mokelumne water and allow more to be left for uses such as replenishing groundwater aquifer. Mokelumne is a tributary to the Delta. By using recycled water more water will be left instream to improve Delta health. Reducing deliveries from Mokelumne will result in greater reservoir storage capacities for regulating flow releases and flood control during high river flow times. Reduces the need for severe rationing during droughts with drought rate surcharges which impacts all EBMUD's 1.3 million ratepayers including disadvantaged communities in the service area. ","Detailed description: EBMUD currently provides potable water to five sites that are candidates for satellite recycled water treatment plants (SRWTP). The development of a recycled water supply will provide these sites with greater independence in their water supply management more reliable water source during droughts and a new sustainable source of irrigation water. EBMUD would partner with these entities and the local collection systems to build a satellite recycled water treatment plant (SRWTP). Wastewater would be diverted from the collection system. Membrane bioreactors would be used to treat the wastewater. Disinfection would be achieved using ultraviolet radiation. The tertiary treated water would be used for landscape irrigation.

"345 ","Chimes Creek Watershed Rehabilitation ","Restoration and rehabilitation of the Chimes Creek watershed: Chimes Creek is a natural urban creek situated below Interstate 580 in Central East Oakland. The creek originates in the hills above I-580 and is culverted for most of its run with the exception of a 2500 stretch through the Millsmont neighborhood. Additional runoff created by the construction of new housing along the Leona ridgetop combined with the El Ni o storms of 1981-1982 caused significant erosion along Chimes Creek. In the early 1990's the City of Oakland partnered with the Alameda County Flood Control District to mitigate the erosion in a joint project that covered the downstream half of Chimes Creek below Nairobi Place. This project addresses the upstream half of Chimes Creek above Nairobi Place where recent grading and construction activities at the Leona Quarry housing development has accelerated the ongoing erosion. This ongoing erosion has greatly impacted creekside residents. In addtion these severe erosion impacts have contributed bed and bank materials combined with toxins and other pollutants from upstream development to the downstream watershed. The downstream watershed is made up of low-income and communities of color with the creek running through a public housing complex. ","() | "," "," "," ","City of Oakland.

If such modeling is not completed there is a greater risk that expenditure of public funds will not result in desirable load reductions or that expectations for a trend in the system in response to management may be unrealistic leading to disappointment and perhaps discontinuation of management activities that are in fact beneficial. This project will:1. Develop a comprehensive water quality model based on a calibrated and verified hydrologic model using the BASINS/HSPF (v. 3) modeling suite recommended by the EPA.2. Use this model to test combinations of feasible management scenarios to assist stakeholders in the prioritization of activities and the level of effort required to meet the 10 and 20 year load reduction targets. Specific questions include:Q1. What influence will the various management options (sediment dredging channel modifications reservoir management hot-spot removal in tributaries and mining areas) have on concentrations and loads? Q2. What the differing influences on grainsize and quality are of suspended and bed sediment?Q3. How long will it take to see a trend and will this trend be sufficient to meet the proposed 10 year loading target (11 kg/y) and the 20 year loading target (7 kg/y)?3.

"368 ","City of Fremont NPDES Stormwater Treatment Measures Evaluation ","As of August 15 2006 most new and redevelopment projects in the Bay Area that create or replace 10000 square feet or more of impervious surfaces are required to consider site design strategies to maximize pervious surfaces within the development area and to incorporate stormwater treatment measures and source control measures into the project design. Although many of the stormwater treatment measures advocated by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Board) have been installed and in use on the East Coast the Northwest and other parts of the world for some time now relatively few have been installed and evaluated in the Bay Area to date. Consequently municipalities in the Bay Area are struggling with implementation of the new NPDES requirements. Specifically knowledge of design and installation challenges is limited; operation and maintenance requirements are unquantified; and pollutant removal effectiveness in the semi-arid Bay Area is unknown. The goal of this project is to study the installation operation and maintenance requirements and pollutant removal efficiencies of two commonly used stormwater treatment measures bioswales and media filtration units located along a major transit corridor in Fremont CA. The information collected for this project will help municipalities to establish budgets and staffing requirements to meet the new stormwater requirements as well as establish pollutant removal efficiencies of the two treatment measures.

The replacement bridge will provide access between the Redwood High School campus and the school s native plant nursery (a former parking lot which was accessed by the existing bridge impacting Cordilleras Creek). Thus the project is intended to instill ongoing stewardship of Cordilleras Creek through 1) support of a native propagation program on-site at the Redwood High School Student Nursery and student monitoring of its progress 2) education and outreach through workshops and community workdays for creekside residents and interested community members; and 3) signage on site describing the project purpose and objectives with information about the project sponsors/funders and who to contact if they want to take part in Cordilleras Creek stewards program.

"397 ","Corte Madera Creek Water Quality Monitoring ","Friends has been monitoring E. coli in fresh water reaches and Enterococcus in tidally influenced reaches of Corte Madera Creek and its tributaries since 2003. During two sampling events over two separate summer field seasons E. coli and Enteroccocus concentrations in Corte Madera Creek and its tributaries exceeded EPA criteria for bathing in all sites except those far upstream (at the headwaters) and downstream (at the mouth). Possible sources of this contamination include leaky sewer pipes and non-human sources such as dogs and water fowl. This continued sampling effort focuses on isolating the source of this contamination and to the extent possible determining the source of the contamination. We use this information to educate students community groups and individual homeowners and engage their participation in developing efforts to improve water quality.

"398 ","Corte Madera Creek Watershed Plan ","Friends of Corte Madera Creek Watershed is requesting funding to complete the Corte Madera Creek Watershed Plan supported by a watershed assessment. We would complete the plan using a community-based approach and would use the planning process to build on community support already present expand the participation of stakeholders and educate stakeholders with the ultimate goal of having the watershed plan adopted by Marin County and the incorporated communities within the watershed. A draft plan has been developed that is consistent with the Marin County Planning Department s draft framework (MCCDA 2004). As part of the planning process we have already identified a need for a comprehensive watershed assessment. The assessment will be conducted using the California Watershed Assessment Manual as a guide. Hydrology/geomorphology and fisheries assesments have been conducted; we need additional information about plant communities non-native invasive species special status species water quality and land use planning. Developing and completing a comprehensive watershed plan will provide an open forum for community-driven involvement with the final product providing an organized framework with clear descriptions of the watershed vision priorities responsible parties and costs. This will increase our capacity for obtaining funding and implementing projects identified through the planning process.

"399 ","Coyote Creek-Lower Reach Maintenance Project ","Coyote Creek originates on the eastern face of the Marin Peninsula range and flows generally east entering the San Francisco Estuary in Richardson Bay. The Coyote Creek watershed consists of approximately 3.6 square miles. The Coyote Creek flood control project was constructed in 1965 by the US Army Corps of Engineers. The upper reach of the flood control project consists of approximately 2950 feet of concrete channel and the lower reach of the project consists of 4150 feet of earthen channel. The earthen section flows through the Bothin Marsh Open Space Preserve a tidal salt marsh. Periodically the channel is surveyed to determine whether dredging is required to restore the channel to its design cross section. The Project seeks to increase  natural  scouring of the channel by increasing the tidal prism through improved connectivity between Bothin Marsh and Coyote Creek. This limits the frequency and extent of dredging activities in order to reduce environmental impacts and maintain costs. The available area to be connected to the flood channel includes 32 additional acres of existing and proposed future marsh habitat.

"400 ","Demonstrating Road Improvements in Napa Basin ","In 1990 the Water Board listed the Napa River for excess sedimentation. A draft TMDL for sedimentation was released in 1995 which identified roads as a significant source of sediment. Roads have been identified as a major sediment source in Carneros and Sulphur Creeks tributaries to the Napa River. The proposed project is aimed at erosion control and sediment reduction to streams through the treatment of high and high-moderate treatment priority sites and hydrologically connected road reaches. Treatments include stream crossing culvert installations fillslope stabilization and a variety of road surface treatments. By applying the proposed treatments approximately 21944 yds3 of sediment would be prevented from being delivered to streams. Direct benefits include: turbidity reduction sediment delivery reduction improved salmonid habitat improved water quality and progress toward meeting sediment reduction goals defined by the draft TMDL.
